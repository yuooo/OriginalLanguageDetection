`` How they go , '' repeated the skipper , `` how they go ! 
They must be well paid ! 
I did not think , '' he added , `` that oars of wood could behave better than ours , but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary . '' 
`` Well they may , '' said one of the rowers , `` they are twelve , and we but eight . '' 
`` Twelve rowers ! '' 
replied Gourville , `` twelve ! 
impossible . '' 
The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded , even for the king . 
This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant , more for the sake of haste than of respect . 
`` What does it mean ? '' 
said Gourville , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent , which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering . 
`` They must be in a hurry , for it is not the king , '' said the patron . 
Fouquet shuddered . 
`` By what sign do you know that it is not the king ? '' 
said Gourville . 
`` In the first place , because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis , which the royal lighter always carries . '' 
`` And then , '' said Fouquet , `` because it is impossible it should be the king , Gourville , as the king was still in Paris yesterday . '' 
Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said : `` You were there yourself yesterday . '' 
`` And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste ? '' 
added he , for the sake of gaining time . 
`` By this , monsieur , '' said the patron ; `` these people must have set out a long while after us , and they have already nearly overtaken us . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Gourville , `` who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even ? '' 
`` We have seen no lighter of that shape , except at Orleans . 
It comes from Orleans , monsieur , and makes great haste . '' 
Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! '' 
`` No , '' said Fouquet , `` on the contrary ; stop short . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
what folly ! '' 
interrupted Gourville , stooping towards his ear . 
`` Pull up ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
The eight oars stopped , and resisting the water , created a retrograde motion . 
It stopped . 
The twelve rowers in the other did not , at first , perceive this maneuver , for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket - shot . 
Fouquet was short-sighted , Gourville was annoyed by the sun , now full in his eyes ; the skipper alone , with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements , perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter . 
`` I can see them ! '' 
cried he ; `` there are two . '' 
`` I can see nothing , '' said Gourville . 
`` You will not be long before you distinguish them ; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us . '' 
But what the patron announced was not realized ; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet , and instead of coming to join its pretended friends , it stopped short in the middle of the river . 
`` I can not comprehend this , '' said the captain . 
`` Nor I , '' cried Gourville . 
`` You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter , '' resumed Fouquet , `` try to describe them to us , before we are too far off . '' 
`` I thought I saw two , '' replied the boatman . 
`` I can only see one now , under the tent . ''
