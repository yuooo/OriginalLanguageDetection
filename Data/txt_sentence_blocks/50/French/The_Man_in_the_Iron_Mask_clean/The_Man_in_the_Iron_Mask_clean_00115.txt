`` What is that ? '' 
`` Without doubt you risk much more than I do , because you love . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus ! 
Well , then , De Guiche , beware of Montalais . '' 
`` What ! 
of that kind friend ? '' 
`` She was the friend of - her you know of . 
She ruined her by pride . '' 
`` You are mistaken . '' 
`` And now , when she has ruined her , she would ravish from her the only thing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Her love . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of the king - a plot formed in the very house of Madame . '' 
`` Can you think so ? '' 
`` I am certain of it . '' 
`` By Montalais ? '' 
`` Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for - the other ! '' 
`` Explain yourself clearly , my friend ; and if I can understand you - '' `` In two words . 
Madame has been long jealous of the king . '' 
`` I know she has - '' `` Oh ! 
fear nothing - you are beloved - you are beloved , count ; do you feel the value of these three words ? 
They signify that you can raise your head , that you can sleep tranquilly , that you can thank God every minute of you life . 
You are beloved ; that signifies that you may hear everything , even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your happiness . 
You are beloved , De Guiche , you are beloved ! 
You do not endure those atrocious nights , those nights without end , which , with arid eye and fainting heart , others pass through who are destined to die . 
You will live long , if you act like the miser who , bit by bit , crumb by crumb , collects and heaps up diamonds and gold . 
You are beloved ! 
- allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever . '' 
De Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man , half mad with despair , till there passed through his heart something like remorse at his own happiness . 
Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement , to assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man . 
`` They will make her , whose name I should wish still to be able to pronounce - they will make her suffer . 
Swear to me that you will not second them in anything - but that you will defend her when possible , as I would have done myself . '' 
`` I swear I will , '' replied De Guiche . 
`` And , '' continued Raoul , `` some day , when you shall have rendered her a great service - some day when she shall thank you , promise me to say these words to her - ' I have done you this kindness , madame , at the warm request of M. de Bragelonne , whom you so deeply injured . ' '' 
`` I swear I will , '' murmured De Guiche . 
`` That is all . 
Adieu ! 
I set out to-morrow , or the day after , for Toulon . 
If you have a few hours to spare , give them to me . '' 
`` All ! 
all ! '' 
cried the young man . 
`` Thank you ! '' 
`` And what are you going to do now ? '' 
`` I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet 's residence , where we hope to find M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , I wish to embrace him before my departure . 
He is a brave man , who loves me dearly .
