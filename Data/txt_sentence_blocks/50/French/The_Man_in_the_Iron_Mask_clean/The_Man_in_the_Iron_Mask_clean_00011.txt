How will you break through the bolts and bars ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , - how did you get the note which announced my arrival to you ? '' 
`` You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note . '' 
`` If we can corrupt one turnkey , we can corrupt ten . '' 
`` Well ; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile ; possible so to conceal him that the king 's people shall not again ensnare him ; possible , in some unknown retreat , to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
said Aramis , smiling . 
`` I admit that , whoever would do this much for me , would seem more than mortal in my eyes ; but as you tell me I am a prince , brother of the king , how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of ? 
And as , to effect this , I must pass a life of war and hatred , how can you cause me to prevail in those combats - render me invulnerable by my enemies ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , reflect on all this ; place me , to-morrow , in some dark cavern at a mountain 's base ; yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river , plain and valley , of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens , or the stormy sky , and it is enough . 
Promise me no more than this , for , indeed , more you can not give , and it would be a crime to deceive me , since you call yourself my friend . '' 
Aramis waited in silence . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , after a moment 's reflection , `` I admire the firm , sound sense which dictates your words ; I am happy to have discovered my monarch 's mind . '' 
`` Again , again ! 
oh , God ! 
for mercy 's sake , '' cried the prince , pressing his icy hands upon his clammy brow , `` do not play with me ! 
I have no need to be a king to be the happiest of men . '' 
`` But I , monseigneur , wish you to be a king for the good of humanity . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the prince , with fresh distrust inspired by the word ; `` ah ! 
with what , then , has humanity to reproach my brother ? '' 
`` I forgot to say , monseigneur , that if you would allow me to guide you , and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom , you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause , and these friends are numerous . '' 
`` Numerous ? '' 
`` Less numerous than powerful , monseigneur . '' 
`` Explain yourself . '' 
`` It is impossible ; I will explain , I swear before Heaven , on that day that I see you sitting on the throne of France . '' 
`` But my brother ? '' 
`` You shall decree his fate . 
Do you pity him ? '' 
`` Him , who leaves me to perish in a dungeon ? 
No , no . 
For him I have no pity ! '' 
`` So much the better . '' 
`` He might have himself come to this prison , have taken me by the hand , and have said , ` My brother , Heaven created us to love , not to contend with one another . 
I come to you . 
A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity , far from mankind , deprived of every joy . 
I will make you sit down beside me ; I will buckle round your waist our father 's sword . 
Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me ? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood ? ' 
` Oh ! 
never , ' I would have replied to him , ' I look on you as my preserver , I will respect you as my master . 
You give me far more than Heaven bestowed ; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world . ' '' 
`` And you would have kept your word , monseigneur ? '' 
`` On my life ! 
While now - now that I have guilty ones to punish - '' `` In what manner , monseigneur ? '' 
`` What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother ? '' 
`` I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded ; I say that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike , of her own flesh , and I conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium . '' 
`` By which you mean - '' `` That if I restore you to your place on your brother 's throne , he shall take yours in prison . '' 
`` Alas !
