`` What sort of man is he ? '' 
`` He is a dark man , broad-shouldered , bull-necked . '' 
A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure , darkening the sun . 
Gourville , who was still looking , with one hand over his eyes , became able to see what he sought , and all at once , jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him : `` Colbert ! '' 
said he , in a voice broken by emotion . 
`` Colbert ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` Too strange ! 
but no , it is impossible ! '' 
`` I tell you I recognized him , and he , at the same time , so plainly recognized me , that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop . 
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track . '' 
`` In that case he would join us , instead of lying by . 
What is he doing there ? '' 
`` He is watching us , without a doubt . '' 
`` I do not like uncertainty , '' said Fouquet ; `` let us go straight up to him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , do not do that , the lighter is full of armed men . '' 
`` He wishes to arrest me , then , Gourville ? 
Why does he not come on ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin . '' 
`` But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor ! '' 
`` Nothing yet proves that they are watching you , monseigneur ; be patient ! '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` Do not stop ; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king 's order with zeal . 
Redouble the speed . 
He who lives will see ! '' 
`` That is better . 
Come ! '' 
cried Fouquet ; `` since they remain stock-still yonder , let us go on . '' 
The captain gave the signal , and Fouquet 's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested . 
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ? 
Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! '
