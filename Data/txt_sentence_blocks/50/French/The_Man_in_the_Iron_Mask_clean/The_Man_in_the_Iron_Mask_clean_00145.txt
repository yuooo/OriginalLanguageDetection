`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? '' 
`` Bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` Well ! 
this M. d'Herblay , who also knew the secret , the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` So hotly pursued , that if he were dead , she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head , to satisfy her he would never speak again . '' 
`` And is that the desire of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` An order is given for it . '' 
`` This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for , madame . '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is well known where he is . '' 
Colbert looked at the duchesse . 
`` Say where , madame . '' 
`` He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` He shall be taken . '' 
It was now the duchesse 's turn to smile . 
`` Do not fancy the capture so easy , '' said she ; `` do not promise it so lightly . '' 
`` Why not , madame ? '' 
`` Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and where you please . '' 
`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? '' 
`` I ? 
- I ask you nothing of the kind ! '' 
`` I thought you did , madame . 
But as I have been mistaken , we will leave him alone ; the king has said nothing about him . '' 
The duchesse bit her nails . 
`` Besides , '' continued Colbert , `` what a poor capture would this bishop be ! 
A bishop game for a king ! 
Oh ! 
no , no ; I will not even take the slightest notice of him . '' 
The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself .
