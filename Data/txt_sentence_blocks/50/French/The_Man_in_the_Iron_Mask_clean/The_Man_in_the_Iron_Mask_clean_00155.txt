Brienne , Rose , and de Saint-Aignan , in general so attentive and obsequious , should scarcely take the least notice , as he , the surintendant , passed . 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers , he whom the king no longer called anything but Fouquet ? 
He raised his head , determined to look every one and everything bravely in the face , and entered the king 's apartment , where a little bell , which we already know , had already announced him to his majesty . 
The king , without rising , nodded to him , and with interest : `` Well ! 
how are you , Monsieur Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am in a high fever , '' replied the surintendant ; `` but I am at the king 's service . '' 
`` That is well ; the States assemble to-morrow ; have you a speech ready ? '' 
Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment . 
`` I have not , sire , '' replied he ; `` but I will improvise one . 
I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . '' 
The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? '' 
`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . '' 
`` Rest yourself , Monsieur Fouquet , do not throw away your strength ; the session of the States will be short , and when my secretaries shall have closed it , I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a fortnight . '' 
`` Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the States ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` Not to me , the surintendant of the finances ? '' 
`` Rest yourself , I beg you ; that is all I have to say to you . '' 
Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head . 
He was evidently busy with some uneasy thought . 
This uneasiness struck the king . 
`` Are you angry at having to rest yourself , M. Fouquet ? '' 
said he .
