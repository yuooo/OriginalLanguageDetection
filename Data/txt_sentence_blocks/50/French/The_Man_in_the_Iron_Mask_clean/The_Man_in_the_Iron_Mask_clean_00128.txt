No , this is it - to know that I should no more meet on earth him whom I now behold with joy ; to know that there would nowhere be a D'Artagnan any more , nowhere again be a Raoul , oh ! 
I am old , look you , I have no longer courage ; I pray God to spare me in my weakness ; but if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion , I should curse him . 
A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God , D'Artagnan ; it is enough to once have cursed a king ! '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
sighed D'Artagnan , a little confused by this violent tempest of grief . 
`` Let me speak to him , Athos . 
Who knows ? '' 
`` Try , if you please , but I am convinced you will not succeed . '' 
`` I will not attempt to console him . 
I will serve him . '' 
`` You will ? '' 
`` Doubtless , I will . 
Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity ? 
I will go to him , I tell you . '' 
Athos shook his head , and continued his walk alone , D'Artagnan , cutting across the brambles , rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him . 
`` Well , Raoul ! 
You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I have a kindness to ask of you , '' replied Bragelonne . 
`` Ask it , then . '' 
`` You will some day return to France ? '' 
`` I hope so . '' 
`` Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere ? '' 
`` No , you must not . '' 
`` But I have many things to say to her . '' 
`` Go and say them to her , then . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
`` Pray , what virtue do you attribute to a letter , which your speech might not possess ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . '' 
`` She loves the king , '' said D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and she is an honest girl . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` And you , you whom she abandons , she , perhaps , loves better than she does the king , but after another fashion . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , do you believe she loves the king ? '' 
`` To idolatry . 
Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling . 
You might continue to live near her , and would be her best friend . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a hideous hope . 
`` Will you do so ? '' 
`` It would be base . '' 
`` That is a very absurd word , which would lead me to think slightly of your understanding . 
Please to understand , Raoul , that it is never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force . 
If your heart says to you , ` Go there , or die , ' why go , Raoul . 
Was she base or brave , she whom you loved , in preferring the king to you , the king whom her heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you ? 
No , she was the bravest of women . 
Do , then , as she has done . 
Oblige yourself . 
Do you know one thing of which I am sure , Raoul ? '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Why , that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man - '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Well !
