`` This crime ? '' 
said Aramis , stupefied . 
`` This abominable crime ! '' 
pursued Fouquet , becoming more and more excited ; `` this crime more execrable than an assassination ! 
this crime which dishonors my name forever , and entails upon me the horror of posterity . '' 
`` You are not in your senses , monsieur , '' replied Aramis , in an irresolute tone of voice ; `` you are speaking too loudly ; take care ! '' 
`` I will call out so loudly , that the whole world shall hear me . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , take care ! '' 
Fouquet turned round towards the prelate , whom he looked at full in the face . 
`` You have dishonored me , '' he said , `` in committing so foul an act of treason , so heinous a crime upon my guest , upon one who was peacefully reposing beneath my roof . 
Oh ! 
woe , woe is me ! '' 
`` Woe to the man , rather , who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of your fortune , your life . 
Do you forget that ? '' 
`` He was my guest , my sovereign . '' 
Aramis rose , his eyes literally bloodshot , his mouth trembling convulsively . 
`` Have I a man out of his senses to deal with ? '' 
he said . 
`` You have an honorable man to deal with . '' 
`` You are mad . '' 
`` A man who will prevent you consummating your crime . '' 
`` You are mad , I say . '' 
`` A man who would sooner , oh ! 
far sooner , die ; who would kill you even , rather than allow you to complete his dishonor . '' 
And Fouquet snatched up his sword , which D'Artagnan had placed at the head of his bed , and clenched it resolutely in his hand . 
Aramis frowned , and thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon . 
This movement did not escape Fouquet , who , full of nobleness and pride in his magnanimity , threw his sword to a distance from him , and approached Aramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` I would sooner die here on the spot than survive this terrible disgrace ; and if you have any pity left for me , I entreat you to take my life . '' 
Aramis remained silent and motionless . 
`` You do not reply ? '' 
said Fouquet . 
Aramis raised his head gently , and a glimmer of hope might be seen once more to animate his eyes . 
`` Reflect , monseigneur , '' he said , `` upon everything we have to expect . 
As the matter now stands , the king is still alive , and his imprisonment saves your life . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Fouquet , `` you may have been acting on my behalf , but I will not , do not , accept your services . 
But , first of all , I do not wish your ruin . 
You will leave this house . '' 
Aramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart . 
`` I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof , '' continued Fouquet , with an air of inexpressible majesty ; `` you will not be more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated . '' 
`` You will be so , '' said Aramis , in a hoarse , prophetic voice , `` you will be so , believe me . '' 
`` I accept the augury , Monsieur d'Herblay ; but nothing shall prevent me , nothing shall stop me . 
You will leave Vaux - you must leave France ; I give you four hours to place yourself out of the king 's reach . '' 
`` Four hours ? '' 
said Aramis , scornfully and incredulously . 
`` Upon the word of Fouquet , no one shall follow you before the expiration of that time . 
You will therefore have four hours ' advance of those whom the king may wish to dispatch after you . '' 
Four hours ! '' 
repeated Aramis , in a thick , smothered voice . 
`` It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to Belle - Isle , which I give you as a place of refuge . '' 
`` Ah ! ''
