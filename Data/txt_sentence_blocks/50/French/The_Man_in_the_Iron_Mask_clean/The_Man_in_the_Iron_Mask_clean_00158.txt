`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed . 
`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . '' 
`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by . 
So much the worse ! 
Now I have orders , I will obey those orders , and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested . 
He is at the castle of Angers , this very M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you have not got him yet , captain . '' 
`` That concerns me ; every one to his trade , sire ; only , once more , reflect ! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet , sire ? '' 
`` Yes , a thousand times , yes ! '' 
`` In writing , sire , then . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
D'Artagnan read it , bowed to the king , and left the room . 
From the height of the terrace he perceived Gourville , who went by with a joyous air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
: The White Horse and the Black . 
`` That is rather surprising , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` Gourville running about the streets so gayly , when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger ; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace , and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant . 
Gourville is rubbing his hands ; that is because he has done something clever . 
Whence comes M. Gourville ? 
Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes . 
Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead ? '' 
And D'Artagnan followed , along the tops of the houses of Nantes , dominated by the castle , the line traced by the streets , as he would have done upon a topographical plan ; only , instead of the dead , flat paper , the living chart rose in relief with the cries , the movements , and the shadows of men and things . 
Beyond the inclosure of the city , the great verdant plains stretched out , bordering the Loire , and appeared to run towards the pink horizon , which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of the marshes .
