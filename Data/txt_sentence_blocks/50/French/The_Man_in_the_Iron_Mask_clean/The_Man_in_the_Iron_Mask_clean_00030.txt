`` Four times as many as ` La Pucelle , ' which M. Chaplain is meditating . 
Is it also on this subject , too , that you have composed a hundred thousand verses ? '' 
`` Listen to me , you eternally absent-minded creature , '' said Moliere . 
`` It is certain , '' continued La Fontaine , `` that legume , for instance , rhymes with posthume . '' 
`` In the plural , above all . '' 
`` Yes , above all in the plural , seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters , but with four ; as orniere does with lumiere . '' 
`` But give me ornieres and lumieres in the plural , my dear Pelisson , '' said La Fontaine , clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend , whose insult he had quite forgotten , `` and they will rhyme . '' 
`` Hem ! '' 
coughed Pelisson . 
`` Moliere says so , and Moliere is a judge of such things ; he declares he has himself made a hundred thousand verses . '' 
`` Come , '' said Moliere , laughing , `` he is off now . '' 
`` It is like rivage , which rhymes admirably with herbage . 
I would take my oath of it . '' 
`` But - '' said Moliere . 
`` I tell you all this , '' continued La Fontaine , `` because you are preparing a divertissement for Vaux , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , the ` Facheux . ' '' 
`` Ah , yes , the ` Facheux ; ' yes , I recollect . 
Well , I was thinking a prologue would admirably suit your divertissement . '' 
`` Doubtless it would suit capitally . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are of my opinion ? '' 
`` So much so , that I have asked you to write this very prologue . '' 
`` You asked me to write it ? '' 
`` Yes , you , and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson , who is engaged upon it at this moment . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is what Pelisson is doing , then ? 
I ` faith , my dear Moliere , you are indeed often right . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` When you call me absent-minded . 
It is a monstrous defect ; I will cure myself of it , and do your prologue for you . '' 
`` But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it ! 
- '' `` Ah , true , miserable rascal that I am ! 
Loret was indeed right in saying I was a poor creature . '' 
`` It was not Loret who said so , my friend . '' 
`` Well , then , whoever said so , 't is the same to me ! 
And so your divertissement is called the ` Facheux ? ' 
Well , can you make heureux rhyme with facheux ? '' 
`` If obliged , yes . '' 
`` And even with capriceux . '' 
`` Oh , no , no . '' 
`` It would be hazardous , and yet why so ? '' 
`` There is too great a difference in the cadences . '' 
`` I was fancying , '' said La Fontaine , leaving Moliere for Loret - `` I was fancying - '' `` What were you fancying ? '' 
said Loret , in the middle of a sentence . 
`` Make haste . '' 
`` You are writing the prologue to the ` Facheux , ' are you not ? '' 
`` No ! 
mordieu ! 
it is Pelisson . '' 
`` Ah , Pelisson , '' cried La Fontaine , going over to him , `` I was fancying , '' he continued , `` that the nymph of Vaux - '' `` Ah , beautiful ! ''
