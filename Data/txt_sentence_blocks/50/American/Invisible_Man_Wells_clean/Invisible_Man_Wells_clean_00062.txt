`` Not quite so badly , '' said Kemp , `` but I can imagine it . '' 
`` I could have smashed the silly devils . 
At last , faint with the desire for tasteful food , I went into another place and demanded a private room . ' 
I am disfigured , ' I said . 
` Badly . ' 
They looked at me curiously , but of course it was not their affair -- and so at last I got my lunch . 
It was not particularly well served , but it sufficed ; and when I had had it , I sat over a cigar , trying to plan my line of action . 
And outside a snowstorm was beginning . 
`` The more I thought it over , Kemp , the more I realised what a helpless absurdity an Invisible Man was -- in a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city . 
Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt of a thousand advantages . 
That afternoon it seemed all disappointment . 
I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable . 
No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them , but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got . 
Ambition -- what is the good of pride of place when you can not appear there ? 
What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah ? 
I have no taste for politics , for the blackguardisms of fame , for philanthropy , for sport . 
What was I to do ? 
And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery , a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man ! '' 
He paused , and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window . 
`` But how did you get to Iping ? '' 
said Kemp , anxious to keep his guest busy talking . 
`` I went there to work . 
I had one hope . 
It was a half idea ! 
I have it still . 
It is a full blown idea now . 
A way of getting back ! 
Of restoring what I have done . 
When I choose . 
When I have done all I mean to do invisibly . 
And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now . '' 
`` You went straight to Iping ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my cheque-book , my luggage and underclothing , order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of mine -- I will show you the calculations as soon as I get my books -- and then I started . 
Jove ! 
I remember the snowstorm now , and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose . '' 
`` At the end , '' said Kemp , `` the day before yesterday , when they found you out , you rather -- to judge by the papers -- '' `` I did . 
Rather . 
Did I kill that fool of a constable ? '' 
`` No , '' said Kemp . 
`` He 's expected to recover . '' 
`` That 's his luck , then . 
I clean lost my temper , the fools ! 
Why could n't they leave me alone ? 
And that grocer lout ? '' 
`` There are no deaths expected , '' said Kemp . 
`` I do n't know about that tramp of mine , '' said the Invisible Man , with an unpleasant laugh . 
`` By Heaven , Kemp , you do n't know what rage is ! 
... To have worked for years , to have planned and plotted , and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course ! 
... Every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me .
