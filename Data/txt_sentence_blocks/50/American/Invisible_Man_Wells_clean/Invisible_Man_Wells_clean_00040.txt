A younger student than you were , almost an albino , six feet high , and broad , with a pink and white face and red eyes , who won the medal for chemistry . '' 
`` I am confused , '' said Kemp . 
`` My brain is rioting . 
What has this to do with Griffin ? '' 
`` I am Griffin . '' 
Kemp thought . 
`` It 's horrible , '' he said . 
`` But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible ? '' 
`` It 's no devilry . 
It 's a process , sane and intelligible enough -- '' `` It 's horrible ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` How on earth -- ? '' 
`` It 's horrible enough . 
But I 'm wounded and in pain , and tired ... Great God ! 
Kemp , you are a man . 
Take it steady . 
Give me some food and drink , and let me sit down here . '' 
Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room , then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed . 
It creaked , and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so . 
He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again . 
`` This beats ghosts , '' he said , and laughed stupidly . 
`` That 's better . 
Thank Heaven , you 're getting sensible ! '' 
`` Or silly , '' said Kemp , and knuckled his eyes . 
`` Give me some whiskey . 
I 'm near dead . '' 
`` It did n't feel so . 
Where are you ? 
If I get up shall I run into you ? 
There ! 
all right . 
Whiskey ? 
Here . 
Where shall I give it to you ? '' 
The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him . 
He let go by an effort ; his instinct was all against it . 
It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair . 
He stared at it in infinite perplexity . 
`` This is -- this must be -- hypnotism . 
You have suggested you are invisible . '' 
`` Nonsense , '' said the Voice . 
`` It 's frantic . '' 
`` Listen to me . '' 
`` I demonstrated conclusively this morning , '' began Kemp , `` that invisibility -- '' `` Never mind what you 've demonstrated ! 
-- I 'm starving , '' said the Voice , `` and the night is chilly to a man without clothes . '' 
`` Food ? '' 
said Kemp . 
The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man rapping it down . 
`` Have you a dressing-gown ? ''
