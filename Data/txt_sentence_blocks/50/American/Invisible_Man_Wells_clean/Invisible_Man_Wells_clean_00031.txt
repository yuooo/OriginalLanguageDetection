His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling . 
When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him . 
`` Pleasant day , '' said the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror . 
`` Very , '' he said . 
`` Just seasonable weather for the time of year , '' said the mariner , taking no denial . 
`` Quite , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
The mariner produced a toothpick , and -LRB- saving his regard -RRB- was engrossed thereby for some minutes . 
His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr. Marvel 's dusty figure , and the books beside him . 
As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket . 
He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel 's appearance with this suggestion of opulence . 
Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination . 
`` Books ? '' 
he said suddenly , noisily finishing with the toothpick . 
Mr. Marvel started and looked at them . 
`` Oh , yes , '' he said . 
`` Yes , they 're books . '' 
`` There 's some ex-traordinary things in books , '' said the mariner . 
`` I believe you , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And some extra-ordinary things out of 'em , '' said the mariner . 
`` True likewise , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
He eyed his interlocutor , and then glanced about him . 
`` There 's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers , for example , '' said the mariner . 
`` There are . '' 
`` In this newspaper , '' said the mariner . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` There 's a story , '' said the mariner , fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate ; `` there 's a story about an Invisible Man , for instance . '' 
Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing . 
`` What will they be writing next ? '' 
he asked faintly . 
`` Ostria , or America ? '' 
`` Neither , '' said the mariner . 
`` Here . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , starting . 
`` When I say here , '' said the mariner , to Mr. Marvel 's intense relief , `` I do n't of course mean here in this place , I mean hereabouts . '' 
`` An Invisible Man ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And what 's he been up to ? '' 
`` Everything , '' said the mariner , controlling Marvel with his eye , and then amplifying , `` every -- blessed -- thing . '' 
`` I ai n't seen a paper these four days , '' said Marvel . 
`` Iping 's the place he started at , '' said the mariner . 
`` In-deed ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` He started there . 
And where he came from , nobody do n't seem to know . 
Here it is : ` Pe-culiar Story from Iping . ' 
And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong -- extra-ordinary . '' 
`` Lord ! ''
