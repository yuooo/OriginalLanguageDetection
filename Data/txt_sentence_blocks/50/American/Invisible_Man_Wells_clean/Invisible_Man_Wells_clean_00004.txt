he said , staring round in a drowsy manner , and speaking over his hand , and then , getting more fully awake , `` certainly . '' 
Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp , and he rose and stretched himself . 
Then came the light , and Mr. Teddy Henfrey , entering , was confronted by this bandaged person . 
He was , he says , `` taken aback . '' 
`` Good afternoon , '' said the stranger , regarding him -- as Mr. Henfrey says , with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles -- `` like a lobster . '' 
`` I hope , '' said Mr. Henfrey , `` that it 's no intrusion . '' 
`` None whatever , '' said the stranger . 
`` Though , I understand , '' he said turning to Mrs. Hall , `` that this room is really to be mine for my own private use . '' 
`` I thought , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` you 'd prefer the clock -- '' `` Certainly , '' said the stranger , `` certainly -- but , as a rule , I like to be alone and undisturbed . 
`` But I 'm really glad to have the clock seen to , '' he said , seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey 's manner . 
`` Very glad . '' 
Mr. Henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw , but this anticipation reassured him . 
The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back . 
`` And presently , '' he said , `` when the clock-mending is over , I think I should like to have some tea . 
But not till the clock-mending is over . '' 
Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room -- she made no conversational advances this time , because she did not want to be snubbed in front of Mr. Henfrey -- when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst . 
She told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman , and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow . 
`` You are certain that is the earliest ? '' 
he said . 
She was certain , with a marked coldness . 
`` I should explain , '' he added , `` what I was really too cold and fatigued to do before , that I am an experimental investigator . '' 
`` Indeed , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , much impressed . 
`` And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances . '' 
`` Very useful things indeed they are , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And I 'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries . '' 
`` Of course , sir . '' 
`` My reason for coming to Iping , '' he proceeded , with a certain deliberation of manner , `` was ... a desire for solitude . 
I do not wish to be disturbed in my work . 
In addition to my work , an accident -- '' `` I thought as much , '' said Mrs. Hall to herself . '' 
-- necessitates a certain retirement . 
My eyes -- are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together . 
Lock myself up . 
Sometimes -- now and then . 
Not at present , certainly . 
At such times the slightest disturbance , the entry of a stranger into the room , is a source of excruciating annoyance to me -- it is well these things should be understood . '' 
`` Certainly , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And if I might make so bold as to ask -- '' `` That I think , is all , '' said the stranger , with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will . 
Mrs. Hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion . 
After Mrs. Hall had left the room , he remained standing in front of the fire , glaring , so Mr. Henfrey puts it , at the clock-mending . 
Mr. Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock , and the face , but extracted the works ; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible . 
He worked with the lamp close to him , and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands , and upon the frame and wheels , and left the rest of the room shadowy . 
When he looked up , coloured patches swam in his eyes . 
Being constitutionally of a curious nature , he had removed the works -- a quite unnecessary proceeding -- with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger . 
But the stranger stood there , perfectly silent and still . 
So still , it got on Henfrey 's nerves . 
He felt alone in the room and looked up , and there , grey and dim , was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly , with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them . 
It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another . 
Then Henfrey looked down again . 
Very uncomfortable position ! 
One would like to say something .
