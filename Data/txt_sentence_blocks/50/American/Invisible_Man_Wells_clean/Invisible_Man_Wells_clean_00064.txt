To rob a little , to hurt a little , and there is the end . 
`` What I want , Kemp , is a goal-keeper , a helper , and a hiding-place , an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace , and unsuspected . 
I must have a confederate . 
With a confederate , with food and rest -- a thousand things are possible . 
`` Hitherto I have gone on vague lines . 
We have to consider all that invisibility means , all that it does not mean . 
It means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forth -- one makes sounds . 
It 's of little help -- a little help perhaps -- in housebreaking and so forth . 
Once you 've caught me you could easily imprison me . 
But on the other hand I am hard to catch . 
This invisibility , in fact , is only good in two cases : It 's useful in getting away , it 's useful in approaching . 
It 's particularly useful , therefore , in killing . 
I can walk round a man , whatever weapon he has , choose my point , strike as I like . 
Dodge as I like . 
Escape as I like . '' 
Kemp 's hand went to his moustache . 
Was that a movement downstairs ? 
`` And it is killing we must do , Kemp . '' 
`` It is killing we must do , '' repeated Kemp . 
`` I 'm listening to your plan , Griffin , but I 'm not agreeing , mind . 
Why killing ? '' 
`` Not wanton killing , but a judicious slaying . 
The point is , they know there is an Invisible Man -- as well as we know there is an Invisible Man . 
And that Invisible Man , Kemp , must now establish a Reign of Terror . 
Yes ; no doubt it 's startling . 
But I mean it . 
A Reign of Terror . 
He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it . 
He must issue his orders . 
He can do that in a thousand ways -- scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice . 
And all who disobey his orders he must kill , and kill all who would defend them . '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
said Kemp , no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound of his front door opening and closing . 
`` It seems to me , Griffin , '' he said , to cover his wandering attention , `` that your confederate would be in a difficult position . '' 
`` No one would know he was a confederate , '' said the Invisible Man , eagerly . 
And then suddenly , `` Hush ! 
What 's that downstairs ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' said Kemp , and suddenly began to speak loud and fast . 
`` I do n't agree to this , Griffin , '' he said . 
`` Understand me , I do n't agree to this . 
Why dream of playing a game against the race ? 
How can you hope to gain happiness ? 
Do n't be a lone wolf . 
Publish your results ; take the world -- take the nation at least -- into your confidence . 
Think what you might do with a million helpers -- '' The Invisible Man interrupted -- arm extended . 
`` There are footsteps coming upstairs , '' he said in a low voice . 
`` Nonsense , '' said Kemp . 
`` Let me see , '' said the Invisible Man , and advanced , arm extended , to the door . 
And then things happened very swiftly . 
Kemp hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him .
