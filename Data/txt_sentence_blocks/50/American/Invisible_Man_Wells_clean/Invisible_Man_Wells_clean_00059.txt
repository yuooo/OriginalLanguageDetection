`` It was a queer little room , poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner . 
On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me , Kemp , to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal . 
And his table manners were irritating . 
Three doors opened into the little room , one going upstairs and one down , but they were all shut . 
I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back . 
Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time . 
`` The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel , but for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating . 
But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot , and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth , he took the whole lot of things after him . 
His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him -- as he would have done ; I never saw such a man for shutting doors -- and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery . 
I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up , and then , finding no good in keeping down there , and the brick floor being cold on my feet , I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire . 
It was burning low , and scarcely thinking , I put on a little coal . 
The noise of this brought him up at once , and he stood aglare . 
He peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me . 
Even after that examination , he scarcely seemed satisfied . 
He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down . 
`` I waited in the little parlour for an age , and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door . 
I just managed to get by him . 
`` On the staircase he stopped suddenly , so that I very nearly blundered into him . 
He stood looking back right into my face and listening . ' 
I could have sworn , ' he said . 
His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip . 
His eye went up and down the staircase . 
Then he grunted and went on up again . 
`` His hand was on the handle of a door , and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face . 
He was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him . 
The man must have had diabolically acute hearing . 
He suddenly flashed into rage . 
` If there 's anyone in this house -- ' he cried with an oath , and left the threat unfinished . 
He put his hand in his pocket , failed to find what he wanted , and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs . 
But I did not follow him . 
I sat on the head of the staircase until his return . 
`` Presently he came up again , still muttering . 
He opened the door of the room , and before I could enter , slammed it in my face . 
`` I resolved to explore the house , and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible . 
The house was very old and tumble-down , damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls , and rat infested . 
Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them . 
Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished , and others were littered with theatrical lumber , bought second-hand , I judged , from its appearance . 
In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes . 
I began routing among these , and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears . 
I heard a stealthy footstep and , looking up just in time , saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand . 
I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and suspicious . 
` It must have been her , ' he said slowly . 
` Damn her ! ' 
`` He shut the door quietly , and immediately I heard the key turn in the lock . 
Then his footsteps retreated . 
I realised abruptly that I was locked in . 
For a minute I did not know what to do . 
I walked from door to window and back , and stood perplexed . 
A gust of anger came upon me . 
But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further , and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf .
