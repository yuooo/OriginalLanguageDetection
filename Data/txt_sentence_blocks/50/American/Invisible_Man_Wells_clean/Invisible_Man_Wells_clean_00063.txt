`` If I have much more of it , I shall go wild -- I shall start mowing 'em . 
`` As it is , they 've made things a thousand times more difficult . '' 
`` No doubt it 's exasperating , '' said Kemp , drily . 
THE PLAN THAT FAILED `` But now , '' said Kemp , with a side glance out of the window , `` what are we to do ? '' 
He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill road -- with an intolerable slowness , as it seemed to Kemp . 
`` What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock ? 
Had you any plan ? '' 
`` I was going to clear out of the country . 
But I have altered that plan rather since seeing you . 
I thought it would be wise , now the weather is hot and invisibility possible , to make for the South . 
Especially as my secret was known , and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man . 
You have a line of steamers from here to France . 
My idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage . 
Thence I could go by train into Spain , or else get to Algiers . 
It would not be difficult . 
There a man might always be invisible -- and yet live . 
And do things . 
I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier , until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me . '' 
`` That 's clear . '' 
`` And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me ! 
He has hidden my books , Kemp . 
Hidden my books ! 
If I can lay my hands on him ! '' 
`` Best plan to get the books out of him first . '' 
`` But where is he ? 
Do you know ? '' 
`` He 's in the town police station , locked up , by his own request , in the strongest cell in the place . '' 
`` Cur ! '' 
said the Invisible Man . 
`` But that hangs up your plans a little . '' 
`` We must get those books ; those books are vital . '' 
`` Certainly , '' said Kemp , a little nervously , wondering if he heard footsteps outside . 
`` Certainly we must get those books . 
But that wo n't be difficult , if he does n't know they 're for you . '' 
`` No , '' said the Invisible Man , and thought . 
Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going , but the Invisible Man resumed of his own accord . 
`` Blundering into your house , Kemp , '' he said , `` changes all my plans . 
For you are a man that can understand . 
In spite of all that has happened , in spite of this publicity , of the loss of my books , of what I have suffered , there still remain great possibilities , huge possibilities -- '' `` You have told no one I am here ? '' 
he asked abruptly . 
Kemp hesitated . 
`` That was implied , '' he said . 
`` No one ? '' 
insisted Griffin . 
`` Not a soul . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Now -- '' The Invisible Man stood up , and sticking his arms akimbo began to pace the study . 
`` I made a mistake , Kemp , a huge mistake , in carrying this thing through alone . 
I have wasted strength , time , opportunities . 
Alone -- it is wonderful how little a man can do alone !
