`` Lock him out , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Do n't let him come in again . 
I half guessed -- I might ha ' known . 
With them goggling eyes and bandaged head , and never going to church of a Sunday . 
And all they bottles -- more 'n it 's right for any one to have . 
He 's put the sperits into the furniture ... . 
My good old furniture ! 
'T was in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl . 
To think it should rise up against me now ! '' 
`` Just a drop more , Janny , '' said Hall . 
`` Your nerves is all upset . '' 
They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o'clock sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers , the blacksmith . 
Mr. Hall 's compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary . 
Would Mr. Wadgers come round ? 
He was a knowing man , was Mr. Wadgers , and very resourceful . 
He took quite a grave view of the case . 
`` Arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft , '' was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers . 
`` You warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he . '' 
He came round greatly concerned . 
They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room , but he did n't seem to be in any hurry . 
He preferred to talk in the passage . 
Over the way Huxter 's apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window . 
He was called over to join the discussion . 
Mr. Huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes . 
The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself ; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action . 
`` Let 's have the facts first , '' insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers . 
`` Let 's be sure we 'd be acting perfectly right in bustin ' that there door open . 
A door onbust is always open to bustin ' , but ye ca n't onbust a door once you 've busted en . '' 
And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord , and as they looked up in amazement , they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his . 
He came down stiffly and slowly , staring all the time ; he walked across the passage staring , then stopped . 
`` Look there ! '' 
he said , and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door . 
Then he entered the parlour , and suddenly , swiftly , viciously , slammed the door in their faces . 
Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away . 
They stared at one another . 
`` Well , if that do n't lick everything ! '' 
said Mr. Wadgers , and left the alternative unsaid . 
`` I 'd go in and ask 'n ` bout it , '' said Wadgers , to Mr. Hall . 
`` I 'd d'mand an explanation . '' 
It took some time to bring the landlady 's husband up to that pitch . 
At last he rapped , opened the door , and got as far as , `` Excuse me -- '' `` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the stranger in a tremendous voice , and `` Shut that door after you . '' 
So that brief interview terminated . 
THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER The stranger went into the little parlour of the `` Coach and Horses '' about half-past five in the morning , and there he remained until near midday , the blinds down , the door shut , and none , after Hall 's repulse , venturing near him . 
All that time he must have fasted . 
Thrice he rang his bell , the third time furiously and continuously , but no one answered him . 
`` Him and his ` go to the devil ' indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
Presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage , and two and two were put together . 
Hall , assisted by Wadgers , went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth , the magistrate , and take his advice .
