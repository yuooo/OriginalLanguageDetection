`` Neither one thing nor the other , '' said the Voice . 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` Chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` One minute , '' said the Voice , penetratingly , tremulous with self-control . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger . 
`` You think I 'm just imagination ? 
Just imagination ? '' 
`` What else can you be ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rubbing the back of his neck . 
`` Very well , '' said the Voice , in a tone of relief . 
`` Then I 'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently . '' 
`` But where are yer ? '' 
The Voice made no answer . 
Whizz came a flint , apparently out of the air , and missed Mr. Marvel 's shoulder by a hair 's - breadth . 
Mr. Marvel , turning , saw a flint jerk up into the air , trace a complicated path , hang for a moment , and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity . 
He was too amazed to dodge . 
Whizz it came , and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud . 
Then he started to run , tripped over an unseen obstacle , and came head over heels into a sitting position . 
`` Now , '' said the Voice , as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp . 
`` Am I imagination ? '' 
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet , and was immediately rolled over again . 
He lay quiet for a moment . 
`` If you struggle any more , '' said the Voice , `` I shall throw the flint at your head . '' 
`` It 's a fair do , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , sitting up , taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile . 
`` I do n't understand it . 
Stones flinging themselves . 
Stones talking . 
Put yourself down . 
Rot away . 
I 'm done . '' 
The third flint fell . 
`` It 's very simple , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm an invisible man . '' 
`` Tell us something I do n't know , '' said Mr. Marvel , gasping with pain . 
`` Where you 've hid -- how you do it -- I _ do n't _ know . 
I 'm beat . '' 
`` That 's all , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's what I want you to understand . '' 
`` Anyone could see that . 
There is no need for you to be so confounded impatient , mister . 
Now then . 
Give us a notion . 
How are you hid ? '' 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's the great point . 
And what I want you to understand is this -- '' `` But whereabouts ? '' 
interrupted Mr. Marvel .
