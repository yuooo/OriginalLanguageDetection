No one ventured upstairs . 
How the stranger occupied himself is unknown . 
Now and then he would stride violently up and down , and twice came an outburst of curses , a tearing of paper , and a violent smashing of bottles . 
The little group of scared but curious people increased . 
Mrs. Huxter came over ; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties -- for it was Whit Monday -- joined the group with confused interrogations . 
Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds . 
He could see nothing , but gave reason for supposing that he did , and others of the Iping youth presently joined him . 
It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays , and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths , a shooting gallery , and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy . 
The gentlemen wore blue jerseys , the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes . 
Woodyer , of the `` Purple Fawn , '' and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns -LRB- which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee -RRB- across the road . 
And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . 
In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . 
So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room . 
About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar . 
`` Mrs. Hall , '' he said . 
Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall . 
Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that . 
Hall was still out . 
She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it . 
`` Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? '' 
she said . 
`` Why was n't my breakfast laid ? 
Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? 
Do you think I live without eating ? '' 
`` Why is n't my bill paid ? '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` That 's what I want to know . '' 
`` I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance -- '' `` I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . 
You ca n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? '' 
The stranger swore briefly but vividly . 
`` Nar , nar ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . 
It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him . 
His next words showed as much . 
`` Look here , my good woman -- '' he began . 
`` Do n't ` good woman ' me , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` I 've told you my remittance has n't come . '' 
`` Remittance indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Still , I daresay in my pocket -- '' `` You told me three days ago that you had n't anything but a sovereign 's worth of silver upon you . '' 
`` Well , I 've found some more -- '' '' ` Ul-lo ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
That seemed to annoy the stranger very much . 
He stamped his foot . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
he said . 
`` That I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall .
