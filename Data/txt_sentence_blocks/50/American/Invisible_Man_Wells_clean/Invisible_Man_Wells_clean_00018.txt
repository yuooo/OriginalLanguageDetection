Look ! 
You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes . 
I could put my arm -- '' He extended his hand ; it seemed to meet something in mid-air , and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation . 
`` I wish you 'd keep your fingers out of my eye , '' said the aerial voice , in a tone of savage expostulation . 
`` The fact is , I 'm all here -- head , hands , legs , and all the rest of it , but it happens I 'm invisible . 
It 's a confounded nuisance , but I am . 
That 's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping , is it ? '' 
The suit of clothes , now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports , stood up , arms akimbo . 
Several other of the men folks had now entered the room , so that it was closely crowded . 
`` Invisible , eh ? '' 
said Huxter , ignoring the stranger 's abuse . 
`` Who ever heard the likes of that ? '' 
`` It 's strange , perhaps , but it 's not a crime . 
Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that 's a different matter , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light , but I got a warrant and it 's all correct . 
What I 'm after ai n't no invisibility , -- it 's burglary . 
There 's a house been broke into and money took . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` And circumstances certainly point -- '' `` Stuff and nonsense ! '' 
said the Invisible Man . 
`` I hope so , sir ; but I 've got my instructions . '' 
`` Well , '' said the stranger , `` I 'll come . 
I 'll come . 
But no handcuffs . '' 
`` It 's the regular thing , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No handcuffs , '' stipulated the stranger . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Jaffers . 
Abruptly the figure sat down , and before any one could realise was was being done , the slippers , socks , and trousers had been kicked off under the table . 
Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat . 
`` Here , stop that , '' said Jaffers , suddenly realising what was happening . 
He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limply and empty in his hand . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
said Jaffers , loudly . 
`` Once he gets the things off -- '' `` Hold him ! '' 
cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger . 
The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall 's face that stopped his open-armed advance , and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton , and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms , even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man 's head . 
Jaffers clutched at it , and only helped to pull it off ; he was struck in the mouth out of the air , and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head . 
`` Look out ! '' 
said everybody , fencing at random and hitting at nothing . 
`` Hold him ! 
Shut the door ! 
Do n't let him loose ! 
I got something ! 
Here he is ! '' 
A perfect Babel of noises they made . 
Everybody , it seemed , was being hit all at once , and Sandy Wadgers , knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose , reopened the door and led the rout . 
The others , following incontinently , were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway . 
The hitting continued .
