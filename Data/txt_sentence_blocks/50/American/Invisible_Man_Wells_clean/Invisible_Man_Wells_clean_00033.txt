From private sources . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the mariner , interested . '' 
_ You _ ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Me . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` And may I ask -- '' `` You 'll be astonished , '' said Mr. Marvel behind his hand . 
`` It 's tremenjous . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` The fact is , '' began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone . 
Suddenly his expression changed marvellously . 
`` Ow ! '' 
he said . 
He rose stiffly in his seat . 
His face was eloquent of physical suffering . 
`` Wow ! '' 
he said . 
`` What 's up ? '' 
said the mariner , concerned . 
`` Toothache , '' said Mr. Marvel , and put his hand to his ear . 
He caught hold of his books . 
`` I must be getting on , I think , '' he said . 
He edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor . 
`` But you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man ! '' 
protested the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself . 
`` Hoax , '' said a Voice . 
`` It 's a hoax , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But it 's in the paper , '' said the mariner . 
`` Hoax all the same , '' said Marvel . 
`` I know the chap that started the lie . 
There ai n't no Invisible Man whatsoever -- Blimey . '' 
`` But how ` bout this paper ? 
D'you mean to say -- ? '' 
`` Not a word of it , '' said Marvel , stoutly . 
The mariner stared , paper in hand . 
Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about . 
`` Wait a bit , '' said the mariner , rising and speaking slowly , `` D'you mean to say -- ? '' 
`` I do , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff , then ? 
What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for ? 
Eh ? '' 
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks . 
The mariner was suddenly very red indeed ; he clenched his hands . 
`` I been talking here this ten minutes , '' he said ; `` and you , you little pot-bellied , leathery-faced son of an old boot , could n't have the elementary manners -- '' `` Do n't you come bandying words with me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Bandying words ! 
I 'm a jolly good mind -- '' `` Come up , '' said a Voice , and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner .
