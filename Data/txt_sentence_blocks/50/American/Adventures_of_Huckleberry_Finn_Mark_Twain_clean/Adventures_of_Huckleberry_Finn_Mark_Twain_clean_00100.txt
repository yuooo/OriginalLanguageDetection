He said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners do n't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody do n't blame them for it , either . 
It ai n't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , Tom said ; it 's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with . 
He said if we war n't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he war n't a prisoner . 
So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy . 
And yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for . 
Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we NEEDED . 
Well , I says , I needed the watermelon . 
But he said I did n't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was . 
He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right . 
So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon . 
Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch . 
By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk . 
He says : `` Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . '' 
`` Tools ? '' 
I says . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Tools for what ? '' 
`` Why , to dig with . 
We ai n't a-going to GNAW him out , are we ? '' 
`` Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ? '' 
I says . 
He turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : `` Huck Finn , did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ? 
Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero ? 
Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it . 
Picks and shovels -- why , they would n't furnish 'em to a king . '' 
`` Well , then , '' I says , `` if we do n't want the picks and shovels , what do we want ? '' 
`` A couple of case-knives . '' 
`` To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Confound it , it 's foolish , Tom . '' 
`` It do n't make no difference how foolish it is , it 's the RIGHT way -- and it 's the regular way . 
And there ai n't no OTHER way , that ever I heard of , and I 've read all the books that gives any information about these things . 
They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt , mind you ; generly it 's through solid rock . 
And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever . 
Why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef , in the harbor of Marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was HE at it , you reckon ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , guess . '' 
`` I do n't know . 
A month and a half . '' 
`` THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR -- and he come out in China . 
THAT 'S the kind . 
I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock . '' 
`` JIM do n't know nobody in China . '' 
`` What 's THAT got to do with it ? 
Neither did that other fellow . 
But you 're always a-wandering off on a side issue . 
Why ca n't you stick to the main point ? '' 
`` All right -- I do n't care where he comes out , so he COMES out ; and Jim do n't , either , I reckon . 
But there 's one thing , anyway -- Jim 's too old to be dug out with a case-knife . 
He wo n't last . ''
