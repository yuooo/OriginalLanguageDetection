Any book will tell you that . 
You try -- that 's all I ask ; just try for two or three days . 
Why , you can get him so in a little while that he 'll love you ; and sleep with you ; and wo n't stay away from you a minute ; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth . '' 
`` PLEASE , Mars Tom -- DOAN ' talk so ! 
I ca n't STAN ' it ! 
He 'd LET me shove his head in my mouf -- fer a favor , hai n't it ? 
I lay he 'd wait a pow ` ful long time ` fo ' I AST him . 
En mo ' en dat , I doan ' WANT him to sleep wid me . '' 
`` Jim , do n't act so foolish . 
A prisoner 's GOT to have some kind of a dumb pet , and if a rattlesnake hai n't ever been tried , why , there 's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life . '' 
`` Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' WANT no sich glory . 
Snake take 'n bite Jim 's chin off , den WHAH is de glory ? 
No , sah , I doan ' want no sich doin 's . '' 
`` Blame it , ca n't you TRY ? 
I only WANT you to try -- you need n't keep it up if it do n't work . '' 
`` But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while I 's a tryin ' him . 
Mars Tom , I 's willin ' to tackle mos ' anything ` at ai n't onreasonable , but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame , I 's gwyne to LEAVE , dat 's SHORE . '' 
`` Well , then , let it go , let it go , if you 're so bull-headed about it . 
We can get you some garter-snakes , and you can tie some buttons on their tails , and let on they 're rattlesnakes , and I reckon that 'll have to do . '' 
`` I k 'n stan ' DEM , Mars Tom , but blame ' ' f I couldn ' get along widout um , I tell you dat . 
I never knowed b ` fo ' ' t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner . '' 
`` Well , it ALWAYS is when it 's done right . 
You got any rats around here ? '' 
`` No , sah , I hai n't seed none . '' 
`` Well , we 'll get you some rats . '' 
`` Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' WANT no rats . 
Dey 's de dadblamedest creturs to ` sturb a body , en rustle roun ' over ` im , en bite his feet , when he 's tryin ' to sleep , I ever see . 
No , sah , gim me g ` yarter-snakes , ' f I 's got to have 'm , but doan ' gim me no rats ; I hain ' got no use f ' r um , skasely . '' 
`` But , Jim , you GOT to have 'em -- they all do . 
So do n't make no more fuss about it . 
Prisoners ai n't ever without rats . 
There ai n't no instance of it . 
And they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies . 
But you got to play music to them . 
You got anything to play music on ? '' 
`` I ain ' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o ' paper , en a juice-harp ; but I reck 'n dey wouldn ' take no stock in a juice-harp . '' 
`` Yes they would . 
THEY do n't care what kind of music 't is . 
A jews-harp 's plenty good enough for a rat . 
All animals like music -- in a prison they dote on it . 
Specially , painful music ; and you ca n't get no other kind out of a jews-harp . 
It always interests them ; they come out to see what 's the matter with you . 
Yes , you 're all right ; you 're fixed very well . 
You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jews-harp ; play ` The Last Link is Broken ' -- that 's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else ; and when you 've played about two minutes you 'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come . 
And they 'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time . '' 
`` Yes , DEY will , I reck ` n , Mars Tom , but what kine er time is JIM havin ' ? 
Blest if I kin see de pint . 
But I 'll do it ef I got to . 
I reck 'n I better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house . '' 
Tom waited to think it over , and see if there was n't nothing else ; and pretty soon he says : `` Oh , there 's one thing I forgot .
