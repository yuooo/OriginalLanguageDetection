`` George Jackson , sir . 
I 'm only a boy . '' 
`` Look here , if you 're telling the truth you need n't be afraid -- nobody 'll hurt you . 
But do n't try to budge ; stand right where you are . 
Rouse out Bob and Tom , some of you , and fetch the guns . 
George Jackson , is there anybody with you ? '' 
`` No , sir , nobody . '' 
I heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light . 
The man sung out : `` Snatch that light away , Betsy , you old fool -- ai n't you got any sense ? 
Put it on the floor behind the front door . 
Bob , if you and Tom are ready , take your places . '' 
`` All ready . '' 
`` Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons ? '' 
`` No , sir ; I never heard of them . '' 
`` Well , that may be so , and it may n't . 
Now , all ready . 
Step forward , George Jackson . 
And mind , do n't you hurry -- come mighty slow . 
If there 's anybody with you , let him keep back -- if he shows himself he 'll be shot . 
Come along now . 
Come slow ; push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeeze in , d' you hear ? '' 
I did n't hurry ; I could n't if I 'd a wanted to . 
I took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only I thought I could hear my heart . 
The dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me . 
When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting . 
I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , `` There , that 's enough -- put your head in . '' 
I done it , but I judged they would take it off . 
The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well . 
The old gentleman says : `` There ; I reckon it 's all right . 
Come in . '' 
As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows -- there war n't none on the side . 
They held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , `` Why , HE ai n't a Shepherdson -- no , there ai n't any Shepherdson about him . '' 
Then the old man said he hoped I would n't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it -- it was only to make sure . 
So he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right . 
He told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : `` Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and do n't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? '' 
`` True for you , Rachel -- I forgot . '' 
So the old lady says : `` Betsy '' -LRB- this was a nigger woman -RRB- , `` you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him -- oh , here he is himself . 
Buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry . '' 
Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me . 
He had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed . 
He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one . 
He says : `` Ai n't they no Shepherdsons around ? '' 
They said , no , 't was a false alarm . 
`` Well , '' he says , `` if they 'd a ben some , I reckon I 'd a got one . '' 
They all laughed , and Bob says : `` Why , Buck , they might have scalped us all , you 've been so slow in coming . '' 
`` Well , nobody come after me , and it ai n't right I 'm always kept down ; I do n't get no show . '' 
`` Never mind , Buck , my boy , '' says the old man , `` you 'll have show enough , all in good time , do n't you fret about that . 
Go ` long with you now , and do as your mother told you . '' 
When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and I put them on . 
While I was at it he asked me what my name was , but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out .
