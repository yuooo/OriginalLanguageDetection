`` Yes , the widow told me all about it . '' 
`` WELL , den ! 
Warn ' dat de beatenes ' notion in de worl ' ? 
You jes ' take en look at it a minute . 
Dah 's de stump , dah -- dat 's one er de women ; heah 's you -- dat 's de yuther one ; I 's Sollermun ; en dish yer dollar bill 's de chile . 
Bofe un you claims it . 
What does I do ? 
Does I shin aroun ' mongs ' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b ` long to , en han ' it over to de right one , all safe en soun ' , de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would ? 
No ; I take en whack de bill in TWO , en give half un it to you , en de yuther half to de yuther woman . 
Dat 's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile . 
Now I want to ast you : what 's de use er dat half a bill ? 
-- ca n't buy noth 'n wid it . 
En what use is a half a chile ? 
I wouldn ' give a dern for a million un um . '' 
`` But hang it , Jim , you 've clean missed the point -- blame it , you 've missed it a thousand mile . '' 
`` Who ? 
Me ? 
Go ` long . 
Doan ' talk to me ` bout yo ' pints . 
I reck 'n I knows sense when I sees it ; en dey ain ' no sense in sich doin 's as dat . 
De ` spute war n't ` bout a half a chile , de ` spute was ` bout a whole chile ; en de man dat think he kin settle a ` spute ` bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan ' know enough to come in out 'n de rain . 
Doan ' talk to me ` bout Sollermun , Huck , I knows him by de back . '' 
`` But I tell you you do n't get the point . '' 
`` Blame de point ! 
I reck 'n I knows what I knows . 
En mine you , de REAL pint is down furder -- it 's down deeper . 
It lays in de way Sollermun was raised . 
You take a man dat 's got on ' y one or two chillen ; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o ' chillen ? 
No , he ai n't ; he ca n't ` ford it . 
HE know how to value 'em . 
But you take a man dat 's got ` bout five million chillen runnin ' roun ' de house , en it 's diffunt . 
HE as soon chop a chile in two as a cat . 
Dey 's plenty mo ' . 
A chile er two , mo ' er less , war n't no consekens to Sollermun , dad fatch him ! '' 
I never see such a nigger . 
If he got a notion in his head once , there war n't no getting it out again . 
He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see . 
So I went to talking about other kings , and let Solomon slide . 
I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago ; and about his little boy the dolphin , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there . 
`` Po ' little chap . '' 
`` But some says he got out and got away , and come to America . '' 
`` Dat 's good ! 
But he 'll be pooty lonesome -- dey ain ' no kings here , is dey , Huck ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Den he cai n't git no situation . 
What he gwyne to do ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know . 
Some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk French . '' 
`` Why , Huck , doan ' de French people talk de same way we does ? '' 
`` NO , Jim ; you could n't understand a word they said -- not a single word . ''
