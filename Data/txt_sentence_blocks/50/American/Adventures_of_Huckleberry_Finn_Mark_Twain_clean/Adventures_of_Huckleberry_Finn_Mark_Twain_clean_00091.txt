`` Not where I hid it I reckon it wo n't , '' I says . 
`` How 'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat ? '' 
It was kinder thin ice , but I says : `` The captain see me standing around , and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore ; so he took me in the texas to the officers ' lunch , and give me all I wanted . '' 
I was getting so uneasy I could n't listen good . 
I had my mind on the children all the time ; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little , and find out who I was . 
But I could n't get no show , Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so . 
Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : `` But here we 're a-running on this way , and you hai n't told me a word about Sis , nor any of them . 
Now I 'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me EVERYTHING -- tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they 're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of . '' 
Well , I see I was up a stump -- and up it good . 
Providence had stood by me this fur all right , but I was hard and tight aground now . 
I see it war n't a bit of use to try to go ahead -- I 'd got to throw up my hand . 
So I says to myself , here 's another place where I got to resk the truth . 
I opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : `` Here he comes ! 
Stick your head down lower -- there , that 'll do ; you ca n't be seen now . 
Do n't you let on you 're here . 
I 'll play a joke on him . 
Children , do n't you say a word . '' 
I see I was in a fix now . 
But it war n't no use to worry ; there war n't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck . 
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him . 
Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him , and says : `` Has he come ? '' 
`` No , '' says her husband . 
`` Good-NESS gracious ! '' 
she says , `` what in the warld can have become of him ? '' 
`` I ca n't imagine , '' says the old gentleman ; `` and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy . '' 
`` Uneasy ! '' 
she says ; `` I 'm ready to go distracted ! 
He MUST a come ; and you 've missed him along the road . 
I KNOW it 's so -- something tells me so . '' 
`` Why , Sally , I COULD N'T miss him along the road -- YOU know that . '' 
`` But oh , dear , dear , what WILL Sis say ! 
He must a come ! 
You must a missed him . 
He -- '' `` Oh , do n't distress me any more 'n I 'm already distressed . 
I do n't know what in the world to make of it . 
I 'm at my wit 's end , and I do n't mind acknowledging ' t I 'm right down scared . 
But there 's no hope that he 's come ; for he COULD N'T come and me miss him . 
Sally , it 's terrible -- just terrible -- something 's happened to the boat , sure ! '' 
`` Why , Silas ! 
Look yonder ! 
-- up the road ! 
-- ai n't that somebody coming ? '' 
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted . 
She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out I come ; and when he turned back from the window there she stood , a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire , and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside . 
The old gentleman stared , and says : `` Why , who 's that ? '' 
`` Who do you reckon ' t is ? '' 
`` I hai n't no idea . 
Who IS it ? '' 
`` It 's TOM SAWYER ! '' 
By jings , I most slumped through the floor !
