`` Well , then , what makes you talk so wild ? ''

I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and I reckon I done the same . 
You could n't a got drunk in that time , so of course you 've been dreaming . ''

`` But , Huck , it 's all jis ' as plain to me as -- '' `` It do n't make no difference how plain it is ; there ai n't nothing in it . 
I know , because I 've been here all the time . '' 
Jim did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it . 
Then he says : `` Well , den , I reck 'n I did dream it , Huck ; but dog my cats ef it ai n't de powerfullest dream I ever see . 
En I hai n't ever had no dream b ` fo ' dat 's tired me like dis one . '' 
`` Oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes . 
But this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , Jim . ''
