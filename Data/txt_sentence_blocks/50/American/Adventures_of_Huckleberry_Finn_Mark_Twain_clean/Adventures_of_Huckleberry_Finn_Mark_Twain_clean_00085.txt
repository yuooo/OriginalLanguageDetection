For if it had n't been for that they 'd a jailed us till them Englishmen 's baggage come -- and then -- the penitentiary , you bet ! 
But that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools had n't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we 'd a slept in our cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to WEAR , too -- longer than WE 'D need 'em . '' 
They was still a minute -- thinking ; then the king says , kind of absent - minded like : `` Mf ! 
And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it ! '' 
That made me squirm ! 
`` Yes , '' says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , `` WE did . '' 
After about a half a minute the king drawls out : `` Leastways , I did . '' 
The duke says , the same way : `` On the contrary , I did . '' 
The king kind of ruffles up , and says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to ? '' 
The duke says , pretty brisk : `` When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was YOU referring to ? '' 
`` Shucks ! '' 
says the king , very sarcastic ; `` but I do n't know -- maybe you was asleep , and did n't know what you was about . '' 
The duke bristles up now , and says : `` Oh , let UP on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame ' fool ? 
Do n't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin ? '' 
`` YES , sir ! 
I know you DO know , because you done it yourself ! '' 
`` It 's a lie ! '' 
-- and the duke went for him . 
The king sings out : `` Take y' r hands off ! 
-- leggo my throat ! 
-- I take it all back ! '' 
The duke says : `` Well , you just own up , first , that you DID hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself . '' 
`` Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b ` lieve you , and take back everything I said . '' 
`` You old scoundrel , I did n't , and you know I did n't . 
There , now ! '' 
`` Well , then , I b ` lieve you . 
But answer me only jest this one more -- now DO N'T git mad ; did n't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it ? '' 
The duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : `` Well , I do n't care if I DID , I did n't DO it , anyway . 
But you not only had it in mind to do it , but you DONE it . '' 
`` I wisht I never die if I done it , duke , and that 's honest . 
I wo n't say I war n't goin ' to do it , because I WAS ; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o ' me . '' 
`` It 's a lie ! 
You done it , and you got to SAY you done it , or -- '' The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : '' ` Nough ! 
-- I OWN UP ! '' 
I was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before . 
So the duke took his hands off and says : `` If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you . 
It 's WELL for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted . 
I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father . 
You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em . 
It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage . 
Cuss you , I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted to get what money I 'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it ALL ! '' 
The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : `` Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it war n't me . '' 
`` Dry up ! 
I do n't want to hear no more out of you ! '' 
says the duke . 
`` And NOW you see what you GOT by it . 
They 've got all their own money back , and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES . 
G'long to bed , and do n't you deffersit ME no more deffersits , long 's YOU live ! '' 
So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off a-snoring in each other 's arms . 
They both got powerful mellow , but I noticed the king did n't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again .
