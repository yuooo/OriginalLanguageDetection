I said I did n't know ; I had n't heard about it before , no way . 
`` Well , guess , '' he says . 
`` How 'm I going to guess , '' says I , `` when I never heard tell of it before ? '' 
`` But you can guess , ca n't you ? 
It 's just as easy . '' 
`` WHICH candle ? '' 
I says . 
`` Why , any candle , '' he says . 
`` I do n't know where he was , '' says I ; `` where was he ? '' 
`` Why , he was in the DARK ! 
That 's where he was ! '' 
`` Well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for ? '' 
`` Why , blame it , it 's a riddle , do n't you see ? 
Say , how long are you going to stay here ? 
You got to stay always . 
We can just have booming times -- they do n't have no school now . 
Do you own a dog ? 
I 've got a dog -- and he 'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in . 
Do you like to comb up Sundays , and all that kind of foolishness ? 
You bet I do n't , but ma she makes me . 
Confound these ole britches ! 
I reckon I 'd better put 'em on , but I 'd ruther not , it 's so warm . 
Are you all ready ? 
All right . 
Come along , old hoss . '' 
Cold corn-pone , cold corn-beef , butter and buttermilk -- that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever I 've come across yet . 
Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women . 
They all smoked and talked , and I eat and talked . 
The young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs . 
They all asked me questions , and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw , and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and Bill went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and Tom and Mort died , and then there war n't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died I took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how I come to be here . 
So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it . 
Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was . 
So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : `` Can you spell , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he says . 
`` I bet you ca n't spell my name , '' says I. `` I bet you what you dare I can , '' says he . 
`` All right , '' says I , `` go ahead . '' 
`` G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now , '' he says . 
`` Well , '' says I , `` you done it , but I did n't think you could . 
It ai n't no slouch of a name to spell -- right off without studying . '' 
I set it down , private , because somebody might want ME to spell it next , and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it . 
It was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too . 
I had n't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style . 
It did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town . 
There war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them . 
There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown , same as they do in town . 
They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log . 
There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it . 
It was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out . 
They would n't took any money for her . 
Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
