He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do . 
So Tom says : `` What 's the vittles for ? 
Going to feed the dogs ? '' 
The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : `` Yes , Mars Sid , A dog . 
Cur ` us dog , too . 
Does you want to go en look at ` im ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
I hunched Tom , and whispers : `` You going , right here in the daybreak ? 
THAT war n't the plan . '' 
`` No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan NOW . '' 
So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much . 
When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : `` Why , HUCK ! 
En good LAN ' ! 
ain ' dat Misto Tom ? '' 
I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it . 
I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : `` Why , de gracious sakes ! 
do he know you genlmen ? '' 
We could see pretty well now . 
Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : `` Does WHO know us ? '' 
`` Why , dis-yer runaway nigger . '' 
`` I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ? '' 
`` What PUT it dar ? 
Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ? '' 
Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : `` Well , that 's mighty curious . 
WHO sung out ? 
WHEN did he sing out ? 
WHAT did he sing out ? '' 
And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , `` Did YOU hear anybody sing out ? '' 
Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : `` No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing . '' 
Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : `` Did you sing out ? '' 
`` No , sah , '' says Jim ; `` I hai n't said nothing , sah . '' 
`` Not a word ? '' 
`` No , sah , I hai n't said a word . '' 
`` Did you ever see us before ? '' 
`` No , sah ; not as I knows on . '' 
So Tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : `` What do you reckon 's the matter with you , anyway ? 
What made you think somebody sung out ? '' 
`` Oh , it 's de dad-blame ' witches , sah , en I wisht I was dead , I do . 
Dey 's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos ' kill me , dey sk ` yers me so . 
Please to do n't tell nobody ` bout it sah , er ole Mars Silas he 'll scole me ; ` kase he say dey AI N'T no witches . 
I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say ! 
I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it DIS time . 
But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's SOT , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth 'n' en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when YOU fine it out en tell um ` bout it , dey doan ' b ` lieve you . '' 
Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : `` I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger . 
If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him . '' 
And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : `` Do n't ever let on to know us . 
And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free . '' 
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then . 
IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place . 
We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : `` Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be .
