By and by he says : `` Starchy clothes -- very . 
You think you 're a good deal of a big-bug , DO N'T you ? '' 
`` Maybe I am , maybe I ai n't , '' I says . 
`` Do n't you give me none o ' your lip , '' says he . 
`` You 've put on considerable many frills since I been away . 
I 'll take you down a peg before I get done with you . 
You 're educated , too , they say -- can read and write . 
You think you 're better 'n your father , now , do n't you , because he ca n't ? 
I 'LL take it out of you . 
Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut 'n foolishness , hey ? 
-- who told you you could ? '' 
`` The widow . 
She told me . '' 
`` The widow , hey ? 
-- and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ai n't none of her business ? '' 
`` Nobody never told her . '' 
`` Well , I 'll learn her how to meddle . 
And looky here -- you drop that school , you hear ? 
I 'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better 'n what HE is . 
You lem me catch you fooling around that school again , you hear ? 
Your mother could n't read , and she could n't write , nuther , before she died . 
None of the family could n't before THEY died . 
I ca n't ; and here you 're a - swelling yourself up like this . 
I ai n't the man to stand it -- you hear ? 
Say , lem me hear you read . '' 
I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars . 
When I 'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house . 
He says : `` It 's so . 
You can do it . 
I had my doubts when you told me . 
Now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills . 
I wo n't have it . 
I 'll lay for you , my smarty ; and if I catch you about that school I 'll tan you good . 
First you know you 'll get religion , too . 
I never see such a son . '' 
He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : `` What 's this ? '' 
`` It 's something they give me for learning my lessons good . '' 
He tore it up , and says : `` I 'll give you something better -- I 'll give you a cowhide . '' 
He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute , and then he says : `` AI N'T you a sweet-scented dandy , though ? 
A bed ; and bedclothes ; and a look 'n' - glass ; and a piece of carpet on the floor -- and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard . 
I never see such a son . 
I bet I 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before I 'm done with you . 
Why , there ai n't no end to your airs -- they say you 're rich . 
Hey ? 
-- how 's that ? '' 
`` They lie -- that 's how . '' 
`` Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass . 
I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich . 
I heard about it away down the river , too . 
That 's why I come .
