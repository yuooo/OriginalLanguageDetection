I did n't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ; and I could n't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach . 
So for a minute I did n't say nothing ; then I says : `` I 'd ruther not TELL you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane , if you do n't mind letting me off ; but I 'll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop 's , if you want to . 
Do you reckon that 'll do ? '' 
`` Oh , yes . '' 
So I wrote : `` I put it in the coffin . 
It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night . 
I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane . '' 
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : `` GOOD-bye . 
I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha 'n' t ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll PRAY for you , too ! '' 
-- and she was gone . 
Pray for me ! 
I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size . 
But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind . 
She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge . 
You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand . 
It sounds like flattery , but it ai n't no flattery . 
And when it comes to beauty -- and goodness , too -- she lays over them all . 
I hai n't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door ; no , I hai n't ever seen her since , but I reckon I 've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever I 'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER , blamed if I would n't a done it or bust . 
Well , Mary Jane she lit out the back way , I reckon ; because nobody see her go . 
When I struck Susan and the hare-lip , I says : `` What 's the name of them people over on t ` other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes ? '' 
They says : `` There 's several ; but it 's the Proctors , mainly . '' 
`` That 's the name , '' I says ; `` I most forgot it . 
Well , Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she 's gone over there in a dreadful hurry -- one of them 's sick . '' 
`` Which one ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; leastways , I kinder forget ; but I thinks it 's -- '' `` Sakes alive , I hope it ai n't HANNER ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry to say it , '' I says , `` but Hanner 's the very one . '' 
`` My goodness , and she so well only last week ! 
Is she took bad ? '' 
`` It ai n't no name for it . 
They set up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they do n't think she 'll last many hours . '' 
`` Only think of that , now ! 
What 's the matter with her ? '' 
I could n't think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so I says : `` Mumps . '' 
`` Mumps your granny ! 
They do n't set up with people that 's got the mumps . '' 
`` They do n't , do n't they ? 
You better bet they do with THESE mumps . 
These mumps is different . 
It 's a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said . '' 
`` How 's it a new kind ? '' 
`` Because it 's mixed up with other things . '' 
`` What other things ? '' 
`` Well , measles , and whooping-cough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brain-fever , and I do n't know what all . '' 
`` My land ! 
And they call it the MUMPS ? '' 
`` That 's what Miss Mary Jane said . '' 
`` Well , what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for ? '' 
`` Why , because it IS the mumps . 
That 's what it starts with . '' 
`` Well , ther ' ai n't no sense in it .
