`` Up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship keepers ! 
down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- Mr. Starbuck away , and muster the boat 's crews . '' 
`` Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir . '' 
`` Oh , oh , oh ! 
how this splinter gores me now ! 
Accursed fate ! 
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate ! '' 
`` Sir ? '' 
`` My body , man , not thee . 
Give me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do . 
Muster the men . 
Surely I have not seen him yet . 
By heaven it can not be ! 
-- missing ? 
-- quick ! 
call them all . '' 
The old man 's hinted thought was true . 
Upon mustering the company , the Parsee was not there . 
`` The Parsee ! '' 
cried Stubb -- `` he must have been caught in - '' `` The black vomit wrench thee ! 
-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone ! '' 
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found . 
`` Aye , sir , '' said Stubb -- `` caught among the tangles of your line -- I thought I saw him dragging under . '' 
`` My line ! 
my line ? 
Gone ? 
-- gone ? 
What means that little word ? 
-- What death-knell rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry . 
The harpoon , too ! 
-- toss over the litter there , -- d'ye see it ? 
-- the forged iron , men , the white whale 's -- no , no , no , -- blistered fool ; this hand did dart it ! 
-- 't is in the fish ! 
-- Aloft there ! 
Keep him nailed-Quick ! 
-- all hands to the rigging of the boats -- collect the oars -- harpooneers ! 
the irons , the irons ! 
-- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets ! 
-- helm there ! 
steady , steady for your life ! 
I 'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I 'll slay him yet ! 
`` Great God ! 
but for one single instant show thyself , '' cried Starbuck ; `` never , never wilt thou capture him , old man -- In Jesus ' name no more of this , that 's worse than devil 's madness . 
Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings : -- what more wouldst thou have ? 
-- Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ? 
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ? 
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ? 
Oh , oh , -- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more ! '' 
`` Starbuck , of late I 've felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know ` st what , in one another 's eyes . 
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless , unfeatured blank .
