The white whale is their demigorgon . 
Hark ! 
the infernal orgies ! 
that revelry is forward ! 
mark the unfaltering silence aft ! 
Methinks it pictures life . 
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . 
The long howl thrills me through ! 
Peace ! 
ye revellers , and set the watch ! 
Oh , life ! 
't is in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , -- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life ! 
't is now that I do feel the latent horror in thee ! 
but 't is not me ! 
that horror 's out of me , and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! 
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences ! 
First Night Watch -LRB- Stubb solus , and mending a brace . -RRB- 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
hem ! 
clear my throat ! 
-- I 've been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha 's the final consequence . 
Why so ? 
Because a laugh 's the wisest , easiest answer to all that 's queer ; and come what will , one comfort 's always left -- that unfailing comfort is , it 's all predestinated . 
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt . 
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him , too . 
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it . 
Well , Stubb , wise Stubb -- that 's my title -- well , Stubb , what of it , Stubb ? 
Here 's a carcase . 
I know not all that may be coming , but be it what it will , I 'll go to it laughing . 
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles ! 
I feel funny . 
Fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
What 's my juicy little pear at home doing now ? 
Crying its eyes out ? 
-- Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers , I dare say , gay as a frigate 's pennant , and so am I -- fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- Aside -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming . 
Midnight , Forecastle HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS -LRB- Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing , lounging , leaning , and lying in various attitudes , all singing in chorus . -RRB- 
Farewell and adieu to you , Spanish ladies ! 
Farewell and adieu to you , ladies of Spain ! 
Our captain 's commanded . 
-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR Oh , boys , do n't be sentimental .
