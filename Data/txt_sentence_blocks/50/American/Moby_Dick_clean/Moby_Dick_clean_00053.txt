But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . 
If money 's to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here ! '' 
`` He smites his chest , '' whispered Stubb , `` what 's that for ? 
methinks it rings most vast , but hollow . '' 
`` Vengeance on a dumb brute ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` that simply smote thee from blindest instinct ! 
Madness ! 
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous . '' 
`` Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer . 
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks . 
But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask . 
If man will strike , strike through the mask ! 
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? 
To me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me . 
Sometimes I think there 's naught beyond . 
But 't is enough . 
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it . 
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him . 
Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I 'd strike the sun if it insulted me . 
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations . 
But not my master , man , is even that fair play . 
Who 's over me ? 
Truth hath no confines . 
Take off thine eye ! 
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare ! 
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow . 
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself . 
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity . 
I meant not to incense thee . 
Let it go . 
Look ! 
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . 
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! 
The crew , man , the crew ! 
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ? 
See Stubb ! 
he laughs ! 
See yonder Chilian ! 
he snorts to think of it . 
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling can not , Starbuck ! 
And what is it ? 
Reckon it . 
'T is but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck . 
What is it more ? 
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone . 
Ah ! 
constrainings seize thee ; I see ! 
the billow lifts thee ! 
Speak , but speak ! 
-- Aye , aye !
