Thou saw ` st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched , longing arms . 
O head ! 
thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham , and not one syllable is thine ! '' 
`` Sail ho ! '' 
cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head . 
`` Aye ? 
Well , now , that 's cheering , '' cried Ahab , suddenly erecting himself , while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow . 
`` That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man . 
-- Where away ? '' 
`` Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us ! 
`` Better and better , man . 
Would now St. Paul would come along that way , and to my breezelessness bring his breeze ! 
O Nature , and O soul of man ! 
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies ; not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind . '' 
The Jeroboam 's Story Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the Pequod began to rock . 
By and by , through the glass the stranger 's boats and manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship . 
But as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the Pequod could not hope to reach her . 
So the signal was set to see what response would be made . 
Here be it said , that like the vessels of military marines , the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal ; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it . 
Thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean , even at considerable distance , and with no small facility . 
The Pequod 's signal was at last responded to by the stranger 's setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket . 
Squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the Pequod 's lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck 's order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat 's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary . 
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that Mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the Pequod 's company . 
For , though himself and the boat 's crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod . 
But this did by no means prevent all communications . 
Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam 's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea -LRB- for by this time it blew very fresh -RRB- , with her main-topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again . 
Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort . 
Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam 's boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities . 
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair . 
A long-skirted , cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists . 
A deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes . 
So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had exclaimed -- `` That 's he ! 
that 's he ! 
-- the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho 's company told us of ! '' 
Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho . 
According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam . 
His story was this : He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest-pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . 
A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common sense exterior , and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam 's whaling voyage . 
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship 's getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet . 
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard . 
He published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica . 
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ; -- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness . 
Moreover , they were afraid of him . 
As such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual 's intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out . 
So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain . 
He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan . 
Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship . 
The consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure . 
The sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him ; in obedience to his instructions , sometimes rendering him personal homage , as to a god . 
Such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true .
