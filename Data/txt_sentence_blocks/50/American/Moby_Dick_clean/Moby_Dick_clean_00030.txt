It was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening . 
`` No more , Queequeg , '' said I , shuddering ; `` that will do ; '' for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them . 
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor 's compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys . 
After all , I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg . 
Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did . 
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety . 
At last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan , we sallied out to board the Pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones . 
His Mark As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , Queequeg carrying his harpoon , Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers . 
`` What do you mean by that , Captain Peleg ? '' 
said I , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf . 
`` I mean , '' he replied , `` he must show his papers . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind Peleg 's , out of the wigwam . 
`` He must show that he 's converted . 
Son of darkness , '' he added , turning to Queequeg , `` art thou at present in communion with any Christian church ? '' 
`` Why , '' said I , `` he 's a member of the first Congregational Church . '' 
Here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches . 
`` First Congregational Church , '' cried Bildad , `` what ! 
that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman 's meeting-house ? '' 
and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg . 
`` How long hath he been a member ? '' 
he then said , turning to me ; `` not very long , I rather guess , young man . '' 
`` No , '' said Peleg , `` and he has n't been baptized right either , or it would have washed some of that devil 's blue off his face . '' 
`` Do tell , now , '' cried Bildad , `` is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy 's meeting ? 
I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord 's day . '' 
`` I do n't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting , '' said I ; `` all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church . 
He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is . '' 
`` Young man , '' said Bildad sternly , `` thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young Hittite . 
What church dost thee mean ? 
answer me . '' 
Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied , `` I mean , sir , the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother 's son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in that we all join hands . '' 
`` Splice , thou mean ` st splice hands , '' cried Peleg , drawing nearer . 
`` Young man , you 'd better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore-mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon . 
Deacon Deuteronomy -- why Father Mapple himself could n't beat it , and he 's reckoned something . 
Come aboard , come aboard : never mind about the papers . 
I say , tell Quohog there -- what 's that you call him ? 
tell Quohog to step along . 
By the great anchor , what a harpoon he 's got there ! 
looks like good stuff that ; and he handles it about right . 
I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat ? 
did you ever strike a fish ? '' 
Without saying a word , Queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this : -- `` Cap ` ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ? 
You see him ? 
well , spose him one whale eye , well , den ! '' 
and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad 's broad brim , clean across the ship 's decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight . 
`` Now , '' said Queequeg , quietly , hauling in the line , `` spos-ee him whale-e eye ; why , dad whale dead . '' 
`` Quick , Bildad , '' said Peleg , his partner , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway . 
`` Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship 's papers . 
We must have Hedgehog there , I mean Quohog , in one of our boats . 
Look ye , Quohog , we 'll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that 's more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket . '' 
So down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship 's company to which I myself belonged .
