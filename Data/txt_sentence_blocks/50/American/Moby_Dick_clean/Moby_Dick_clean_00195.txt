`` There she blows , '' was sung out from the mast-head . 
`` Where away ? '' 
demanded the captain . 
`` Three points off the lee bow , sir . '' 
`` Raise up your wheel . 
Steady ! '' 
`` Steady , sir . '' 
`` Mast-head ahoy ! 
Do you see that whale now ? '' 
`` Ay ay , sir ! 
A shoal of Sperm Whales ! 
There she blows ! 
There she breaches ! '' 
`` Sing out ! 
sing out every time ! '' 
`` Ay Ay , sir ! 
There she blows ! 
there -- there -- thar she blows - bowes - bo-o-os ! '' 
`` How far off ? ''

Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded , he parried the assault for some time with a lance ; but the furious monster at length rushed on the boat ; himself and comrades only being preserved by leaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable . ''

`` Nantucket itself , '' said Mr. Webster , `` is a very striking and peculiar portion of the National interest . 
There is a population of eight or nine thousand persons living here in the sea , adding largely every year to the National wealth by the boldest and most persevering industry . ''

`` The voyages of the Dutch and English to the Northern Ocean , in order , if possible , to discover a passage through it to India , though they failed of their main object , laid-open the haunts of the whale . '' 
-- MCCULLOCH 'S COMMERCIAL DICTIONARY . 
`` These things are reciprocal ; the ball rebounds , only to bound forward again ; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale , the whalemen seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West Passage . '' 
-- FROM `` SOMETHING '' UNPUBLISHED . 
`` It is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being struck by her near appearance . 
The vessel under short sail , with look-outs at the mast-heads , eagerly scanning the wide expanse around them , has a totally different air from those engaged in regular voyage . ''
