`` Now , cook , '' said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; Stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention . '' 
`` All ` dention , '' said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position . 
`` Well , '' said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; `` I shall now go back to the subject of this steak . 
In the first place , how old are you , cook ? '' 
`` What dat do wid de ` teak , '' said the old black , testily . 
`` Silence ! 
How old are you , cook ? '' '' 
` Bout ninety , dey say , '' he gloomily muttered . 
And have you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and do n't know yet how to cook a whale-steak ? '' 
rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the question . 
`` Where were you born , cook ? '' '' 
` Hind de hatchway , in ferry-boat , goin ' ober de Roanoke . '' 
`` Born in a ferry-boat ! 
That 's queer , too . 
But I want to know what country you were born in , cook ! '' 
`` Did n't I say de Roanoke country ? '' 
he cried sharply . 
`` No , you did n't , cook ; but I 'll tell you what I 'm coming to , cook . 
You must go home and be born over again ; you do n't know how to cook a whale-steak yet . '' 
`` Bress my soul , if I cook noder one , '' he growled , angrily , turning round to depart . 
`` Come back here , cook ; -- here , hand me those tongs ; -- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? 
Take it , I say '' -- holding the tongs towards him -- `` take it , and taste it . '' 
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , `` Best cooked ` teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy . '' 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; `` do you belong to the church ? '' 
`` Passed one once in Cape-Down , '' said the old man sullenly . 
`` And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures , have you , cook ! 
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Where do you expect to go to , cook ? '' 
`` Go to bed berry soon , '' he mumbled , half-turning as he spoke . 
`` Avast ! 
heave to ! 
I mean when you die , cook . 
It 's an awful question . 
Now what 's your answer ? '' 
`` When dis old brack man dies , '' said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , `` he hisself wo n't go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him . '' 
`` Fetch him ? 
How ? 
In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ? 
And fetch him where ? '' 
`` Up dere , '' said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly . 
`` So , then , you expect to go up into our main-top , do you , cook , when you are dead ? 
But do n't you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ? 
Main-top , eh ? '' 
`` Did n't say dat t ` all , '' said Fleece , again in the sulks . 
`` You said up there , did n't you ? 
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . 
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber 's hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you do n't get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging . 
It 's a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it 's no go . 
But none of us are in heaven yet .
