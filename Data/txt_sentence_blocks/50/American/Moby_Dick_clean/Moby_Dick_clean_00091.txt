So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman . 
The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all . 
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life . 
And lo ! 
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun 's rays like a mirror . 
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . 
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . 
As if struck by some enchanter 's wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . 
`` Clear away the boats ! 
Luff ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . 
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers . 
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set . 
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up . 
`` There go flukes ! '' 
was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb 's producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted . 
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker 's boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture . 
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers . 
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use . 
Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play . 
And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault . 
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish . 
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going `` head out '' ; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed . 
* * It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale 's enormous head consists . 
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him . 
So that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed . 
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat . 
`` Start her , start her , my men ! 
Do n't hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder-claps , that 's all , '' cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke . 
`` Start her , now ; give 'em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego . 
Start her , Tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that 's all . 
Start her ! '' 
`` Woo-hoo ! 
Wa-hee ! '' 
screamed the Gay-Header in reply , raising some old war-whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave . 
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild . 
`` Kee-hee ! 
Kee-hee ! '' 
yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage . 
`` Ka-la ! 
Koo-loo ! '' 
howled Queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier 's steak . 
And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea . 
Meanwhile , Stubb , retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth . 
Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard -- `` Stand up , Tashtego ! 
-- give it to him ! '' 
The harpoon was hurled . 
`` Stern all ! '' 
The oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists .
