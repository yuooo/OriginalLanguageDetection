damned in the midst of Paradise ! 
Good night -- good night ! 
-LRB- waving his hand , he moves from the window . -RRB- 
'T was not so hard a task . 
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve . 
Or , if you will , like so many ant-hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match . 
Oh , hard ! 
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting ! 
What I 've dared , I 've willed ; and what I 've willed , I 'll do ! 
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac , I am madness maddened ! 
That wild madness that 's only calm to comprehend itself ! 
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye ! 
I lost this leg . 
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer . 
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one . 
That 's more than ye , ye great gods , ever were . 
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket-players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes ! 
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; do n't pommel me ! 
No , ye 've knocked me down , and I am up again ; but ye have run and hidden . 
Come forth from behind your cotton bags ! 
I have no long gun to reach ye . 
Come , Ahab 's compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me . 
Swerve me ? 
ye can not swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves ! 
man has ye there . 
Swerve me ? 
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run . 
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! 
Naught 's an obstacle , naught 's an angle to the iron way ! 
Dusk By the Mainmast ; Starbuck leaning against it . 
My soul is more than matched ; she 's over-manned ; and by a madman ! 
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field ! 
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me ! 
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it . 
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut . 
Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it . 
Yet is there hope . 
Time and tide flow wide . 
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe . 
His heaven-insulting purpose , God may wedge aside . 
I would up heart , were it not like lead . 
But my whole clock 's run down ; my heart the all-controlling weight , I have no key to lift again . 
-LSB- A burst of revelry from the forecastle . -RSB- 
Oh , God ! 
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! 
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea .
