Saw a live tree , and you do n't get this dust ; amputate a live bone , and you do n't get it -LRB- sneezes -RRB- . 
Come , come , you old Smut , there , bear a hand , and let 's have that ferrule and buckle-screw ; I 'll be ready for them presently . 
Lucky now -LRB- sneezes -RRB- there 's no knee-joint to make ; that might puzzle a little ; but a mere shin-bone -- why it 's easy as making hop-poles ; only I should like to put a good finish on . 
Time , time ; if I but only had the time , I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever -LRB- sneezes -RRB- scraped to a lady in a parlor . 
Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I 've seen in shop windows would n't compare at all . 
They soak water , they do ; and of course get rheumatic , and have to be doctored -LRB- sneezes -RRB- with washes and lotions , just like live legs . 
There ; before I saw it off , now , I must call his old Mogulship , and see whether the length will be all right ; too short , if anything , I guess . 
Ha ! 
that 's the heel ; we are in luck ; here he comes , or it 's somebody else , that 's certain . 
AHAB -LRB- advancing -RRB- -LRB- During the ensuing scene , the carpenter continues sneezing at times -RRB- . 
Well , manmaker ! 
Just in time , sir . 
If the captain pleases , I will now mark the length . 
Let me measure , sir . 
Measured for a leg ! 
good . 
Well , it 's not the first time . 
About it ! 
There ; keep thy finger on it . 
This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its grip once . 
So , so ; it does pinch some . 
Oh , sir , it will break bones -- beware , beware ! 
No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man . 
What 's Prometheus about there ? 
-- the blacksmith , I mean -- what 's he about ? 
He must be forging the buckle-screw , sir , now . 
Right . 
It 's a partnership ; he supplies the muscle part . 
He makes a fierce red flame there ! 
Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work . 
Um-m . 
So he must . 
I do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , Prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what 's made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell 's probable . 
How the soot flies ! 
This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of . 
Carpenter , when he 's through with that buckle , tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades ; there 's a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack . 
Sir ? 
Hold ; while Prometheus is about it , I 'll order a complete man after a desirable pattern . 
Imprimis , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel then , legs with roots to 'em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , brass forehead , and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains ; and let me see -- shall I order eyes to see outwards ? 
No , but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards . 
There , take the order , and away . 
Now , what 's he speaking about , and who 's he speaking to , I should like to know ? 
Shall I keep standing here ? 
-LRB- aside . -RRB- 
'T is but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome ; here 's one . 
No , no , no ; I must have a lantern . 
Ho , ho ! 
That 's it , hey ? 
Here are two , sir ; one will serve my turn . 
What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for , man ?
