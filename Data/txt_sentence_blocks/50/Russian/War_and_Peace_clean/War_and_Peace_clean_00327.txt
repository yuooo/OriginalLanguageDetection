Natasha , how glad I am you 're not angry with me ! 
Tell me everything -- the whole truth . 
What did he say ? '' 
Natasha became thoughtful . 
`` Oh , Sonya , if you knew him as I do ! 
He said ... He asked me what I had promised Bolkonski . 
He was glad I was free to refuse him . '' 
Sonya sighed sorrowfully . 
`` But you have n't refused Bolkonski ? '' 
said she . 
`` Perhaps I have . 
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski . 
Why do you think so badly of me ? '' 
`` I do n't think anything , only I do n't understand this ... '' `` Wait a bit , Sonya , you 'll understand everything . 
You 'll see what a man he is ! 
Now do n't think badly of me or of him . 
I do n't think badly of anyone : I love and pity everybody . 
But what am I to do ? '' 
Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her . 
The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha 's face became , the more serious and stern grew Sonya 's . 
`` Natasha , '' said she , `` you asked me not to speak to you , and I have n't spoken , but now you yourself have begun . 
I do n't trust him , Natasha . 
Why this secrecy ? '' 
`` Again , again ! '' 
interrupted Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I am afraid for you ! '' 
`` Afraid of what ? '' 
`` I am afraid you 're going to your ruin , '' said Sonya resolutely , and was herself horrified at what she had said . 
Anger again showed in Natasha 's face . 
`` And I 'll go to my ruin , I will , as soon as possible ! 
It 's not your business ! 
It wo n't be you , but I , who 'll suffer . 
Leave me alone , leave me alone ! 
I hate you ! '' 
`` Natasha ! '' 
moaned Sonya , aghast . 
`` I hate you , I hate you ! 
You 're my enemy forever ! '' 
And Natasha ran out of the room . 
Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her . 
With the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house , taking up now one occupation , now another , and at once abandoning them . 
Hard as it was for Sonya , she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight . 
The day before the count was to return , Sonya noticed that Natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past , whom Sonya took to be Anatole . 
Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state . 
She answered questions at random , began sentences she did not finish , and laughed at everything . 
After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha 's door timidly waiting to let her pass . 
She let the girl go in , and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered . 
Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening . 
Sonya knocked at her door . 
Natasha did not let her in .
