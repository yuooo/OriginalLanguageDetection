Some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka , the count 's other groom , a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds . 
Before the hunt , by old custom , the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy , taken a snack , and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux . 
He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive . 
His eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual , and as he sat in his saddle , wrapped up in his fur coat , he looked like a child taken out for an outing . 
The thin , hollow-cheeked Chekmar , having got everything ready , kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years , and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat . 
A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood -LRB- it was plain that he had had a lesson -RRB- and stopped behind the count . 
This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman 's cloak , with a tall peaked cap on his head . 
He was the buffoon , who went by a woman 's name , Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Well , Nastasya Ivanovna ! '' 
whispered the count , winking at him . 
`` If you scare away the beast , Daniel 'll give it you ! '' 
`` I know a thing or two myself ! '' 
said Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Hush ! '' 
whispered the count and turned to Simon . 
`` Have you seen the young countess ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` With young Count Peter , by the Zharov rank grass , '' answered Simon , smiling . 
`` Though she 's a lady , she 's very fond of hunting . '' 
`` And you 're surprised at the way she rides , Simon , eh ? '' 
said the count . 
`` She 's as good as many a man ! '' 
`` Of course ! 
It 's marvelous . 
So bold , so easy ! '' 
`` And Nicholas ? 
Where is he ? 
By the Lyadov upland , is n't he ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . 
He knows where to stand . 
He understands the matter so well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded , '' said Simon , well knowing what would please his master . 
`` Rides well , eh ? 
And how well he looks on his horse , eh ? '' 
`` A perfect picture ! 
How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the Zavarzinsk thicket the other day ! 
Leaped a fearful place ; what a sight when they rushed from the covert ... the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price ! 
Yes , one would have to search far to find another as smart . '' 
`` To search far ... '' repeated the count , evidently sorry Simon had not said more . 
`` To search far , '' he said , turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox . 
`` The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform , Michael Sidorych ... '' Simon did not finish , for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue . 
He bent down his head and listened , shaking a warning finger at his master . 
`` They are on the scent of the cubs ... '' he whispered , `` straight to the Lyadov uplands . '' 
The count , forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face , looked into the distance straight before him , down the narrow open space , holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any . 
After the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel 's hunting horn ; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry , with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf . 
The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds , but changed to the cry of ulyulyu , and above the others rose Daniel 's voice , now a deep bass , now piercingly shrill . 
His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field . 
After listening a few moments in silence , the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs : the sound of the larger pack , eagerly giving tongue , began to die away in the distance , the other pack rushed by the wood past the count , and it was with this that Daniel 's voice was heard calling ulyulyu . 
The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again , but both were becoming more distant . 
Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled ; the count too sighed and , noticing the snuffbox in his hand , opened it and took a pinch .
