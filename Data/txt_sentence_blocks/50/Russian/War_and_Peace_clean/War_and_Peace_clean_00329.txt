`` I 'm not joking , I 'm talking sense . 
Come here , come here ! '' 
Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov , trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily . 
`` Now listen to me . 
I 'm telling you this for the last time . 
Why should I joke about it ? 
Did I hinder you ? 
Who arranged everything for you ? 
Who found the priest and got the passport ? 
Who raised the money ? 
I did it all . '' 
`` Well , thank you for it . 
Do you think I am not grateful ? '' 
And Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov . 
`` I helped you , but all the same I must tell you the truth ; it is a dangerous business , and if you think about it -- a stupid business . 
Well , you 'll carry her off -- all right ! 
Will they let it stop at that ? 
It will come out that you 're already married . 
Why , they 'll have you in the criminal court ... '' `` Oh , nonsense , nonsense ! '' 
Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace . 
`` Did n't I explain to you ? 
What ? '' 
And Anatole , with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning , repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov a hundred times . 
`` Did n't I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion : if this marriage is invalid , '' he went on , crooking one finger , `` then I have nothing to answer for ; but if it is valid , no matter ! 
Abroad no one will know anything about it . 
Is n't that so ? 
And do n't talk to me , do n't , do n't . '' 
`` Seriously , you 'd better drop it ! 
You 'll only get yourself into a mess ! '' 
`` Go to the devil ! '' 
cried Anatole and , clutching his hair , left the room , but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dolokhov with his feet turned under him . 
`` It 's the very devil ! 
What ? 
Feel how it beats ! '' 
He took Dolokhov 's hand and put it on his heart . 
`` What a foot , my dear fellow ! 
What a glance ! 
A goddess ! '' 
he added in French . 
`` What ? '' 
Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him -- evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him . 
`` Well and when the money 's gone , what then ? '' 
`` What then ? 
Eh ? '' 
repeated Anatole , sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future . 
`` What then ? 
... Then , I do n't know ... . 
But why talk nonsense ! '' 
He glanced at his watch . 
`` It 's time ! ''
