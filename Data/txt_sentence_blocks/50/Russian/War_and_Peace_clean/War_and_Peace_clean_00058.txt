`` Ah ! 
mon ami , I only pray , and hope that God will hear me . 
Andrew ... '' she said timidly after a moment 's silence , `` I have a great favor to ask of you . '' 
`` What is it , dear ? '' 
`` No -- promise that you will not refuse ! 
It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you , but it will comfort me . 
Promise , Andrusha ! 
... '' said she , putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it , as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted . 
She looked timidly at her brother . 
`` Even if it were a great deal of trouble ... '' answered Prince Andrew , as if guessing what it was about . 
`` Think what you please ! 
I know you are just like Father . 
Think as you please , but do this for my sake ! 
Please do ! 
Father 's father , our grandfather , wore it in all his wars . '' 
-LRB- She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule . -RRB- 
`` So you promise ? '' 
`` Of course . 
What is it ? '' 
`` Andrew , I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off . 
Do you promise ? '' 
`` If it does not weigh a hundredweight and wo n't break my neck ... To please you ... '' said Prince Andrew . 
But immediately , noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister 's face , he repented and added : `` I am glad ; really , dear , I am very glad . '' 
`` Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself , for in Him alone is truth and peace , '' said she in a voice trembling with emotion , solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small , oval , antique , dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting , on a finely wrought silver chain . 
She crossed herself , kissed the icon , and handed it to Andrew . 
`` Please , Andrew , for my sake ! 
... '' Rays of gentle light shone from her large , timid eyes . 
Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin , sickly face and made it beautiful . 
Her brother would have taken the icon , but she stopped him . 
Andrew understood , crossed himself and kissed the icon . 
There was a look of tenderness , for he was touched , but also a gleam of irony on his face . 
`` Thank you , my dear . '' 
She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa . 
They were silent for a while . 
`` As I was saying to you , Andrew , be kind and generous as you always used to be . 
Do n't judge Lise harshly , '' she began . 
`` She is so sweet , so good-natured , and her position now is a very hard one . '' 
`` I do not think I have complained of my wife to you , Masha , or blamed her . 
Why do you say all this to me ? '' 
Red patches appeared on Princess Mary 's face and she was silent as if she felt guilty . 
`` I have said nothing to you , but you have already been talked to . 
And I am sorry for that , '' he went on . 
The patches grew deeper on her forehead , neck , and cheeks . 
She tried to say something but could not . 
Her brother had guessed right : the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement , and how she dreaded it , and had complained of her fate , her father-in-law , and her husband . 
After crying she had fallen asleep . 
Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister . 
`` Know this , Masha : I ca n't reproach , have not reproached , and never shall reproach my wife with anything , and I can not reproach myself with anything in regard to her ; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed . 
But if you want to know the truth ... if you want to know whether I am happy ? 
No !
