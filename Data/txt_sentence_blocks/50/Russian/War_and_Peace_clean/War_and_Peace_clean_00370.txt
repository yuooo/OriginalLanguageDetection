At dinner , at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of St. George , Shinshin told them the town news , of the illness of the old Georgian princess , of Metivier 's disappearance from Moscow , and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchin and accused of being a French `` spyer '' -LRB- so Count Rostopchin had told the story -RRB- , and how Rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was `` not a spire at all , but only an old German ruin . '' 
`` People are being arrested ... '' said the count . 
`` I 've told the countess she should not speak French so much . 
It 's not the time for it now . '' 
`` And have you heard ? '' 
Shinshin asked . 
`` Prince Golitsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian . 
It is becoming dangerous to speak French in the streets . '' 
`` And how about you , Count Peter Kirilych ? 
If they call up the militia , you too will have to mount a horse , '' remarked the old count , addressing Pierre . 
Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner , seeming not to grasp what was said . 
He looked at the count . 
`` Oh yes , the war , '' he said . 
`` No ! 
What sort of warrior should I make ? 
And yet everything is so strange , so strange ! 
I ca n't make it out . 
I do n't know , I am very far from having military tastes , but in these times no one can answer for himself . '' 
After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked Sonya , who was considered an excellent reader , to read the appeal . 
`` To Moscow , our ancient Capital ! 
`` The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces . 
He comes to despoil our beloved country , '' Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice . 
The count listened with closed eyes , heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages . 
Natasha sat erect , gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at Pierre . 
Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round . 
The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto . 
In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over . 
Shinshin , with a sarcastic smile on his lips , was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity : Sonya 's reading , any remark of the count 's , or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself . 
After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia , the hopes the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility , Sonya , with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her , read the last words : `` We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation , and for the direction of all our levies , both those now barring the enemy 's path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear . 
May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head , and may Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia ! '' 
`` Yes , that 's it ! '' 
cried the count , opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly , as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose ; and he added , `` Let the Emperor but say the word and we 'll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing . '' 
Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count 's patriotism , Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her father . 
`` What a darling our Papa is ! '' 
she cried , kissing him , and she again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits . 
`` There ! 
Here 's a patriot for you ! '' 
said Shinshin . 
`` Not a patriot at all , but simply ... '' Natasha replied in an injured tone . 
`` Everything seems funny to you , but this is n't at all a joke ... '' `` A joke indeed ! '' 
put in the count . 
`` Let him but say the word and we 'll all go ... . 
We 're not Germans ! '' 
`` But did you notice , it says , ` for consultation ' ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` Never mind what it 's for ... '' At this moment , Petya , to whom nobody was paying any attention , came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill : `` Well , Papa , I tell you definitely , and Mamma too , it 's as you please , but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army , because I ca n't ... that 's all ... '' The countess , in dismay , looked up to heaven , clasped her hands , and turned angrily to her husband . 
`` That comes of your talking ! '' 
said she . 
But the count had already recovered from his excitement . 
`` Come , come ! ''
