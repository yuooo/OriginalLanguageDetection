Pierre asked . 
`` And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general ? '' 
said Prince Andrew , with a smile . 
Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands . 
`` Oh , master , master , what a sin ! 
And you who have a son ! '' 
she began , her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red . 
`` Master , what have you said ? 
God forgive you ! '' 
And she crossed herself . 
`` Lord forgive him ! 
My dear , what does it mean ? 
... '' she asked , turning to Princess Mary . 
She got up and , almost crying , began to arrange her wallet . 
She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said , and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house . 
`` Now , why need you do it ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Why did you come to me ? 
... '' `` Come , Pelageya , I was joking , '' said Pierre . 
`` Princesse , ma parole , je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser . 
* I did not mean anything , I was only joking , '' he said , smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense . 
`` It was all my fault , and Andrew was only joking . '' 
* `` Princess , on my word , I did not wish to offend her . '' 
Pelageya stopped doubtfully , but in Pierre 's face there was such a look of sincere penitence , and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre , that she was gradually reassured . 
The pilgrim woman was appeased and , being encouraged to talk , gave a long account of Father Amphilochus , who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense , and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs , and how she , taking some dried bread with her , had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints . 
`` I 'd pray awhile to one , ponder awhile , then go on to another . 
I 'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics , and there was such peace all around , such blessedness , that one do n't want to come out , even into the light of heaven again . '' 
Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously . 
Prince Andrew went out of the room , and then , leaving `` God 's folk '' to finish their tea , Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room . 
`` You are very kind , '' she said to him . 
`` Oh , I really did not mean to hurt her feelings . 
I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them . '' 
Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately . 
`` I have known you a long time , you see , and am as fond of you as of a brother , '' she said . 
`` How do you find Andrew ? '' 
she added hurriedly , not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words . 
`` I am very anxious about him . 
His health was better in the winter , but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure . 
And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually . 
He has not a character like us women who , when we suffer , can weep away our sorrows . 
He keeps it all within him . 
Today he is cheerful and in good spirits , but that is the effect of your visit -- he is not often like that . 
If you could persuade him to go abroad . 
He needs activity , and this quiet regular life is very bad for him . 
Others do n't notice it , but I see it . '' 
Toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door , hearing the bells of the old prince 's carriage approaching . 
Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch . 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
asked the old prince , noticing Pierre as he got out of , the carriage . 
`` Ah !
