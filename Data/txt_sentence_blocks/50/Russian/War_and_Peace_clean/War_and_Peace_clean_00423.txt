Boris belonged to the latter and no one else , while showing servile respect to Kutuzov , could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything . 
Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen , or even if Kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen . 
In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow 's action , and new men would come to the front . 
So Boris was full of nervous vivacity all day . 
After Kaysarov , others whom Pierre knew came up to him , and he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon him , or to listen to all that was told him . 
The faces all expressed animation and apprehension , but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success ; his mind , however , was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces -- an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death . 
Kutuzov noticed Pierre 's figure and the group gathered round him . 
`` Call him to me , '' said Kutuzov . 
An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness ' wish , and Pierre went toward Kutuzov 's bench . 
But a militiaman got there before him . 
It was Dolokhov . 
`` How did that fellow get here ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` He 's a creature that wriggles in anywhere ! '' 
was the answer . 
`` He has been degraded , you know . 
Now he wants to bob up again . 
He 's been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy 's picket line at night ... . 
He 's a brave fellow . '' 
Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov . 
`` I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting , but then I should n't lose anything ... '' Dolokhov was saying . 
`` Yes , yes . '' 
`` But if I were right , I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for which I am ready to die . '' 
`` Yes , yes . '' 
`` And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his skin , please think of me ... . 
Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene Highness . '' 
`` Yes ... Yes ... '' Kutuzov repeated , his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre . 
Just then Boris , with his courtierlike adroitness , stepped up to Pierre 's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner , without raising his voice , said to Pierre , as though continuing an interrupted conversation : `` The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die . 
What heroism , Count ! '' 
Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene Highness . 
He knew Kutuzov 's attention would be caught by those words , and so it was . 
`` What are you saying about the militia ? '' 
he asked Boris . 
`` Preparing for tomorrow , your Serene Highness -- for death -- they have put on clean shirts . '' 
`` Ah ... a wonderful , a matchless people ! '' 
said Kutuzov ; and he closed his eyes and swayed his head . 
`` A matchless people ! '' 
he repeated with a sigh . 
`` So you want to smell gunpowder ? '' 
he said to Pierre . 
`` Yes , it 's a pleasant smell . 
I have the honor to be one of your wife 's adorers . 
Is she well ? 
My quarters are at your service . '' 
And as often happens with old people , Kutuzov began looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do . 
Then , evidently remembering what he wanted , he beckoned to Andrew Kaysarov , his adjutant 's brother . 
`` Those verses ... those verses of Marin 's ... how do they go , eh ? 
Those he wrote about Gerakov : ` Lectures for the corps inditing ' ... Recite them , recite them ! '' 
said he , evidently preparing to laugh . 
Kaysarov recited ... .
