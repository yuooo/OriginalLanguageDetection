`` I said that a fallen woman should be forgiven , but I did n't say I could forgive her . 
I ca n't . '' 
`` But can this be compared ... ? '' 
said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply : `` Yes , ask her hand again , be magnanimous , and so on ? 
... Yes , that would be very noble , but I am unable to follow in that gentleman 's footsteps . 
If you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that ... of all that ! 
Well , good-by . 
So you 'll give her the packet ? '' 
Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary . 
The old man seemed livelier than usual . 
Princess Mary was the same as always , but beneath her sympathy for her brother , Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off . 
Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rostovs , and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else . 
At dinner the talk turned on the war , the approach of which was becoming evident . 
Prince Andrew talked incessantly , arguing now with his father , now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles , and showing an unnatural animation , the cause of which Pierre so well understood . 
That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs ' to fulfill the commission entrusted to him . 
Natasha was in bed , the count at the Club , and Pierre , after giving the letters to Sonya , went to Marya Dmitrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news . 
Ten minutes later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich , '' said she . 
`` But how ? 
Are we to take him up to her ? 
The room there has not been tidied up . '' 
`` No , she has dressed and gone into the drawing room , '' said Sonya . 
Marya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders . 
`` When will her mother come ? 
She has worried me to death ! 
Now mind , do n't tell her everything ! '' 
said she to Pierre . 
`` One has n't the heart to scold her , she is so much to be pitied , so much to be pitied . '' 
Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room , emaciated , with a pale set face , but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find her . 
When he appeared at the door she grew flurried , evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up . 
Pierre hastened to her . 
He thought she would give him her hand as usual ; but she , stepping up to him , stopped , breathing heavily , her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing , but with quite a different expression of face . 
`` Peter Kirilovich , '' she began rapidly , `` Prince Bolkonski was your friend -- is your friend , '' she corrected herself . 
-LRB- It seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different . -RRB- 
`` He told me once to apply to you ... '' Pierre sniffed as he looked at her , but did not speak . 
Till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her , but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach . 
`` He is here now : tell him ... to for ... forgive me ! '' 
She stopped and breathed still more quickly , but did not shed tears . 
`` Yes ... I will tell him , '' answered Pierre ; `` but ... '' He did not know what to say . 
Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant . 
`` No , I know all is over , '' she said hurriedly . 
`` No , that can never be . 
I 'm only tormented by the wrong I have done him . 
Tell him only that I beg him to forgive , forgive , forgive me for everything ... '' She trembled all over and sat down on a chair . 
A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre 's heart . 
`` I will tell him , I will tell him everything once more , '' said Pierre . 
`` But ... I should like to know one thing ... '' `` Know what ? '' 
Natasha 's eyes asked . 
`` I should like to know , did you love ... '' Pierre did not know how to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him -- `` did you love that bad man ? ''
