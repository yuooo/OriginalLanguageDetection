`` Where is the Emperor ? 
Where is Kutuzov ? '' 
Rostov kept asking everyone he could stop , but got no answer from anyone . 
At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer . 
`` Eh , brother ! 
They 've all bolted long ago ! '' 
said the soldier , laughing for some reason and shaking himself free . 
Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk , Rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him . 
The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded . 
`` It ca n't be ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` It must have been someone else . '' 
`` I saw him myself . '' 
replied the man with a self-confident smile of derision . 
`` I ought to know the Emperor by now , after the times I 've seen him in Petersburg . 
I saw him just as I see you ... . 
There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything . 
How they made the four black horses fly ! 
Gracious me , they did rattle past ! 
It 's time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych . 
I do n't think Ilya drives anyone except the Tsar ! '' 
Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on , when a wounded officer passing by addressed him : `` Who is it you want ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The commander in chief ? 
He was killed by a cannon ball -- struck in the breast before our regiment . '' 
`` Not killed -- wounded ! '' 
another officer corrected him . 
`` Who ? 
Kutuzov ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Not Kutuzov , but what 's his name -- well , never mind ... there are not many left alive . 
Go that way , to that village , all the commanders are there , '' said the officer , pointing to the village of Hosjeradek , and he walked on . 
Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going . 
The Emperor was wounded , the battle lost . 
It was impossible to doubt it now . 
Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him , in which he saw turrets and a church . 
What need to hurry ? 
What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov , even if they were alive and unwounded ? 
`` Take this road , your honor , that way you will be killed at once ! '' 
a soldier shouted to him . 
`` They 'd kill you there ! '' 
`` Oh , what are you talking about ? '' 
said another . 
`` Where is he to go ? 
That way is nearer . '' 
Rostov considered , and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed . 
`` It 's all the same now . 
If the Emperor is wounded , am I to try to save myself ? '' 
he thought . 
He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen .
