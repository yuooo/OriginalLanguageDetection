`` What ? 
What ? 
What ? 
... Cut them down ! 
What ? 
... '' said Rostov , waking up . 
At the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him , where the enemy was , the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices . 
His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts . 
Over there , where the shouting came from , a fire flared up and went out again , then another , and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder . 
Rostov could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them . 
The din of many voices was too great ; all he could hear was : `` ahahah ! '' 
and `` rrrr ! '' 
`` What 's that ? 
What do you make of it ? '' 
said Rostov to the hussar beside him . 
`` That must be the enemy 's camp ! '' 
The hussar did not reply . 
`` Why , do n't you hear it ? '' 
Rostov asked again , after waiting for a reply . 
`` Who can tell , your honor ? '' 
replied the hussar reluctantly . 
`` From the direction , it must be the enemy , '' repeated Rostov . 
`` It may be he or it may be nothing , '' muttered the hussar . 
`` It 's dark ... Steady ! '' 
he cried to his fidgeting horse . 
Rostov 's horse was also getting restive : it pawed the frozen ground , pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights . 
The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce . 
The lights spread farther and farther , probably along the line of the French camp . 
Rostov no longer wanted to sleep . 
The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him . 
`` Vive l'Empereur ! 
L'Empereur ! '' 
he now heard distinctly . 
`` They ca n't be far off , probably just beyond the stream , '' he said to the hussar beside him . 
The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily . 
The sound of horse 's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard , and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared , looming huge as an elephant . 
`` Your honor , the generals ! '' 
said the sergeant , riding up to Rostov . 
Rostov , still looking round toward the fires and the shouts , rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line . 
One was on a white horse . 
Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy 's camp . 
Rostov rode up to Bagration , reported to him , and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying . 
`` Believe me , '' said Prince Dolgorukov , addressing Bagration , `` it is nothing but a trick ! 
He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us . '' 
`` Hardly , '' said Bagration . 
`` I saw them this evening on that knoll ; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too ... . 
Officer ! '' 
said Bagration to Rostov , `` are the enemy 's skirmishers still there ? '' 
`` They were there this evening , but now I do n't know , your excellency . 
Shall I go with some of my hussars to see ? ''
