`` About my wife ... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands ... '' `` Why talk nonsense ? 
Say what you want . '' 
`` When her confinement is due , send to Moscow for an accoucheur ... . 
Let him be here ... '' The old prince stopped writing and , as if not understanding , fixed his stern eyes on his son . 
`` I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work , '' said Prince Andrew , evidently confused . 
`` I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong , but it is her fancy and mine . 
They have been telling her things . 
She has had a dream and is frightened . '' 
`` Hm ... Hm ... '' muttered the old prince to himself , finishing what he was writing . 
`` I 'll do it . '' 
He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh . 
`` It 's a bad business , eh ? '' 
`` What is bad , Father ? '' 
`` The wife ! '' 
said the old prince , briefly and significantly . 
`` I do n't understand ! '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` No , it ca n't be helped , lad , '' said the prince . 
`` They 're all like that ; one ca n't unmarry . 
Do n't be afraid ; I wo n't tell anyone , but you know it yourself . '' 
He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers , shook it , looked straight into his son 's face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him , and again laughed his frigid laugh . 
The son sighed , thus admitting that his father had understood him . 
The old man continued to fold and seal his letter , snatching up and throwing down the wax , the seal , and the paper , with his accustomed rapidity . 
`` What 's to be done ? 
She 's pretty ! 
I will do everything . 
Make your mind easy , '' said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter . 
Andrew did not speak ; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him . 
The old man got up and gave the letter to his son . 
`` Listen ! '' 
said he ; `` do n't worry about your wife : what can be done shall be . 
Now listen ! 
Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich . 
* I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant : a bad position ! 
Tell him I remember and like him . 
Write and tell me how he receives you . 
If he is all right -- serve him . 
Nicholas Bolkonski 's son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor . 
Now come here . '' 
* Kutuzov . 
He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words , but his son was accustomed to understand him . 
He led him to the desk , raised the lid , drew out a drawer , and took out an exercise book filled with his bold , tall , close handwriting . 
`` I shall probably die before you . 
So remember , these are my memoirs ; hand them to the Emperor after my death . 
Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter ; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvorov 's wars . 
Send it to the Academy . 
Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone . 
You will find them useful . '' 
Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet . 
He felt that he must not say it .
