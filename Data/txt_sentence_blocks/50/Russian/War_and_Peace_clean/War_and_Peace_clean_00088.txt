The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face . 
Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted , then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks . 
His small , deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight . 
`` Well , now tell me about your exploits , '' said he . 
Bolkonski , very modestly without once mentioning himself , described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War . 
`` They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles , '' said he in conclusion . 
Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared . 
`` Cependant , mon cher , '' he remarked , examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye , `` malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army , j' avoue que votre victoire n'est pas des plus victorieuses . '' 
* * `` But my dear fellow , with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army , I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious . '' 
He went on talking in this way in French , uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis . 
`` Come now ! 
You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division , and even then Mortier slips through your fingers ! 
Where 's the victory ? '' 
`` But seriously , '' said Prince Andrew , `` we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm ... '' `` Why did n't you capture one , just one , marshal for us ? '' 
`` Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade . 
We had expected , as I told you , to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon . '' 
`` And why did n't you do it at seven in the morning ? 
You ought to have been there at seven in the morning , '' returned Bilibin with a smile . 
`` You ought to have been there at seven in the morning . '' 
`` Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone ? '' 
retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone . 
`` I know , '' interrupted Bilibin , `` you 're thinking it 's very easy to take marshals , sitting on a sofa by the fire ! 
That is true , but still why did n't you capture him ? 
So do n't be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your victory . 
Even I , a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy , do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler , or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater ... True , we have no Prater here ... '' He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead . 
`` It is now my turn to ask you ` why ? ' 
mon cher , '' said Bolkonski . 
`` I confess I do not understand : perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence , but I ca n't make it out . 
Mack loses a whole army , the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder . 
Kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory , destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French , and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details . '' 
`` That 's just it , my dear fellow . 
You see it 's hurrah for the Tsar , for Russia , for the Orthodox Greek faith ! 
All that is beautiful , but what do we , I mean the Austrian court , care for your victories ? 
Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand -LRB- one archduke 's as good as another , as you know -RRB- and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte 's , that will be another story and we 'll fire off some cannon ! 
But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us . 
The Archduke Karl does nothing , the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself . 
You abandon Vienna , give up its defense -- as much as to say : ` Heaven is with us , but heaven help you and your capital ! ' 
The one general whom we all loved , Schmidt , you expose to a bullet , and then you congratulate us on the victory ! 
Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived . 
It 's as if it had been done on purpose , on purpose . 
Besides , suppose you did gain a brilliant victory , if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory , what effect would that have on the general course of events ? 
It 's too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army ! '' 
`` What ? 
Occupied ? 
Vienna occupied ? '' 
`` Not only occupied , but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn , and the count , our dear Count Vrbna , goes to him for orders . '' 
After the fatigues and impressions of the journey , his reception , and especially after having dined , Bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard . 
`` Count Lichtenfels was here this morning , '' Bilibin continued , `` and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully described : Prince Murat et tout le tremblement ... You see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you ca n't be received as a savior . '' 
`` Really I do n't care about that , I do n't care at all , '' said Prince Andrew , beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria 's capital . 
`` How is it Vienna was taken ?
