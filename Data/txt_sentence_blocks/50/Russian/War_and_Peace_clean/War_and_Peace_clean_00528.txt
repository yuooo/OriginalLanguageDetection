`` What ? 
What did you say ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` Who ? 
I ? '' 
said Karataev . 
`` I say things happen not as we plan but as God judges , '' he replied , thinking that he was repeating what he had said before , and immediately continued : `` Well , and you , have you a family estate , sir ? 
And a house ? 
So you have abundance , then ? 
And a housewife ? 
And your old parents , are they still living ? '' 
he asked . 
And though it was too dark for Pierre to see , he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier 's lips as he put these questions . 
He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents , especially that he had no mother . 
`` A wife for counsel , a mother-in-law for welcome , but there 's none as dear as one 's own mother ! '' 
said he . 
`` Well , and have you little ones ? '' 
he went on asking . 
Again Pierre 's negative answer seemed to distress him , and he hastened to add : `` Never mind ! 
You 're young folks yet , and please God may still have some . 
The great thing is to live in harmony ... '' `` But it 's all the same now , '' Pierre could not help saying . 
`` Ah , my dear fellow ! '' 
rejoined Karataev , `` never decline a prison or a beggar 's sack ! '' 
He seated himself more comfortably and coughed , evidently preparing to tell a long story . 
`` Well , my dear fellow , I was still living at home , '' he began . 
`` We had a well-to-do homestead , plenty of land , we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for . 
When Father and we went out mowing there were seven of us . 
We lived well . 
We were real peasants . 
It so happened ... '' And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone 's copse to take wood , how he had been caught by the keeper , had been tried , flogged , and sent to serve as a soldier . 
`` Well , lad , '' and a smile changed the tone of his voice `` we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing ! 
If it had not been for my sin , my brother would have had to go as a soldier . 
But he , my younger brother , had five little ones , while I , you see , only left a wife behind . 
We had a little girl , but God took her before I went as a soldier . 
I come home on leave and I 'll tell you how it was , I look and see that they are living better than before . 
The yard full of cattle , the women at home , two brothers away earning wages , and only Michael the youngest , at home . 
Father , he says , ` All my children are the same to me : it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten . 
But if Platon had n't been shaved for a soldier , Michael would have had to go . ' 
called us all to him and , will you believe it , placed us in front of the icons . 
` Michael , ' he says , ` come here and bow down to his feet ; and you , young woman , you bow down too ; and you , grandchildren , also bow down before him ! 
Do you understand ? ' 
he says . 
That 's how it is , dear fellow . 
Fate looks for a head . 
But we are always judging , ` that 's not well -- that 's not right ! ' 
Our luck is like water in a dragnet : you pull at it and it bulges , but when you 've drawn it out it 's empty ! 
That 's how it is . '' 
And Platon shifted his seat on the straw . 
After a short silence he rose . 
`` Well , I think you must be sleepy , '' said he , and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating : `` Lord Jesus Christ , holy Saint Nicholas , Frola and Lavra !
