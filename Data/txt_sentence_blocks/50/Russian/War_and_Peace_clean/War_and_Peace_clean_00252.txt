`` Well , I wo n't marry , but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it . '' 
Natasha smiled and looked at her mother . 
`` Not to marry , but just so , '' she added . 
`` How so , my pet ? '' 
`` Just so . 
There 's no need for me to marry him . 
But ... just so . '' 
`` Just so , just so , '' repeated the countess , and shaking all over , she went off into a good humored , unexpected , elderly laugh . 
`` Do n't laugh , stop ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` You 're shaking the whole bed ! 
You 're awfully like me , just such another giggler ... . 
Wait ... '' and she seized the countess ' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger , saying , `` June , '' and continued , kissing , `` July , August , '' on the other hand . 
`` But , Mamma , is he very much in love ? 
What do you think ? 
Was anybody ever so much in love with you ? 
And he 's very nice , very , very nice . 
Only not quite my taste -- he is so narrow , like the dining-room clock ... . 
Do n't you understand ? 
Narrow , you know -- gray , light gray ... '' `` What rubbish you 're talking ! '' 
said the countess . 
Natasha continued : `` Do n't you really understand ? 
Nicholas would understand ... . 
Bezukhov , now , is blue , dark-blue and red , and he is square . '' 
`` You flirt with him too , '' said the countess , laughing . 
`` No , he is a Freemason , I have found out . 
He is fine , dark-blue and red ... . 
How can I explain it to you ? '' 
`` Little countess ! '' 
the count 's voice called from behind the door . 
`` You 're not asleep ? '' 
Natasha jumped up , snatched up her slippers , and ran barefoot to her own room . 
It was a long time before she could sleep . 
She kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her . 
`` Sonya ? '' 
she thought , glancing at that curled-up , sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair . 
`` No , how could she ? 
She 's virtuous . 
She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more . 
Even Mamma does not understand . 
It is wonderful how clever I am and how ... charming she is , '' she went on , speaking of herself in the third person , and imagining it was some very wise man -- the wisest and best of men -- who was saying it of her . 
`` There is everything , everything in her , '' continued this man . 
`` She is unusually intelligent , charming ... and then she is pretty , uncommonly pretty , and agile -- she swims and rides splendidly ... and her voice ! 
One can really say it 's a wonderful voice ! '' 
She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini , threw herself on her bed , laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep , called Dunyasha the maid to put out the candle , and before Dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams , where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality , and even more so because it was different . 
Next day the countess called Boris aside and had a talk with him , after which he ceased coming to the Rostovs ' . 
On the thirty-first of December , New Year 's Eve , 1809 -- 10 an old grandee of Catherine 's day was giving a ball and midnight supper . 
The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present . 
The grandee 's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with innumerable lights . 
Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize , and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch .
