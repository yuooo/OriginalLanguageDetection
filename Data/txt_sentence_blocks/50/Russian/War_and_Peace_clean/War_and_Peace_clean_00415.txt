`` Do you know , I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme . '' 
* * `` A little bit in love with the young man . '' 
`` Forfeit , forfeit , forfeit ! '' 
`` But how could one say that in Russian ? '' 
When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin 's broadsheets that had been brought that day . 
The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchin had forbidden people to leave Moscow was false ; on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmen 's wives were leaving the city . 
`` There will be less panic and less gossip , '' ran the broadsheet `` but I will stake my life on it that that will not enter Moscow . '' 
These words showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow . 
The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyazma , that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French , but that as many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed , weapons were ready for them at the arsenal : sabers , pistols , and muskets which could be had at a low price . 
The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former Chigirin talks . 
Pierre pondered over these broadsheets . 
Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near . 
`` Shall I join the army and enter the service , or wait ? '' 
he asked himself for the hundredth time . 
He took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience . 
`` If this patience comes out , '' he said to himself after shuffling the cards , holding them in his hand , and lifting his head , `` if it comes out , it means ... what does it mean ? '' 
He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in . 
`` Then it will mean that I must go to the army , '' said Pierre to himself . 
`` Come in , come in ! '' 
he added to the princess . 
Only the eldest princess , the one with the stony face and long waist , was still living in Pierre 's house . 
The two younger ones had both married . 
`` Excuse my coming to you , cousin , '' she said in a reproachful and agitated voice . 
`` You know some decision must be come to . 
What is going to happen ? 
Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting . 
How is it that we are staying on ? '' 
`` On the contrary , things seem satisfactory , ma cousine , '' said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her , always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor . 
`` Satisfactory , indeed ! 
Very satisfactory ! 
Barbara Ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves . 
It certainly does them credit ! 
And the people too are quite mutinous -- they no longer obey , even my maid has taken to being rude . 
At this rate they will soon begin beating us . 
One ca n't walk in the streets . 
But , above all , the French will be here any day now , so what are we waiting for ? 
I ask just one thing of you , cousin , '' she went on , `` arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg . 
Whatever I may be , I ca n't live under Bonaparte 's rule . '' 
`` Oh , come , ma cousine ! 
Where do you get your information from ? 
On the contrary ... '' `` I wo n't submit to your Napoleon ! 
Others may if they please ... . 
If you do n't want to do this ... '' `` But I will , I 'll give the order at once . '' 
The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with . 
Muttering to herself , she sat down on a chair . 
`` But you have been misinformed , '' said Pierre . 
`` Everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger . 
See ! 
I 've just been reading ... '' He showed her the broadsheet . 
`` Count Rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow . ''
