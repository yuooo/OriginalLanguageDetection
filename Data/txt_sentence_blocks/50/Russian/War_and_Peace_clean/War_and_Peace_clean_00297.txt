`` Here , hand some fruit jelly to the Turk ! '' 
she ordered the butler who was handing things round . 
`` That 's not forbidden by his law . '' 
Sometimes , as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers , who -- having decided once for all that being disguised , no one would recognize them -- were not at all shy , Pelageya Danilovna hid her face in her handkerchief , and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible , kindly , elderly laughter . 
`` My little Sasha ! 
Look at Sasha ! '' 
she said . 
After Russian country dances and chorus dances , Pelageya Danilovna made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle : a ring , a string , and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together . 
In an hour , all the costumes were crumpled and disordered . 
The corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring , flushed , and merry faces . 
Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the mummers , admired their cleverly contrived costumes , and particularly how they suited the young ladies , and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well . 
The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room , and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom . 
`` Now to tell one 's fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening ! '' 
said an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs , during supper . 
`` Why ? '' 
said the eldest Melyukov girl . 
`` You would n't go , it takes courage ... '' `` I 'll go , '' said Sonya . 
`` Tell what happened to the young lady ! '' 
said the second Melyukov girl . 
`` Well , '' began the old maid , `` a young lady once went out , took a cock , laid the table for two , all properly , and sat down . 
After sitting a while , she suddenly hears someone coming ... a sleigh drives up with harness bells ; she hears him coming ! 
He comes in , just in the shape of a man , like an officer -- comes in and sits down to table with her . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
screamed Natasha , rolling her eyes with horror . 
`` Yes ? 
And how ... did he speak ? '' 
`` Yes , like a man . 
Everything quite all right , and he began persuading her ; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow , but she got frightened , just got frightened and hid her face in her hands . 
Then he caught her up . 
It was lucky the maids ran in just then ... '' `` Now , why frighten them ? '' 
said Pelageya Danilovna . 
`` Mamma , you used to try your fate yourself ... '' said her daughter . 
`` And how does one do it in a barn ? '' 
inquired Sonya . 
`` Well , say you went to the barn now , and listened . 
It depends on what you hear ; hammering and knocking -- that 's bad ; but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that , too . '' 
`` Mamma , tell us what happened to you in the barn . '' 
Pelageya Danilovna smiled . 
`` Oh , I 've forgotten ... '' she replied . 
`` But none of you would go ? '' 
`` Yes , I will ; Pelageya Danilovna , let me ! 
I 'll go , '' said Sonya . 
`` Well , why not , if you 're not afraid ? '' 
`` Louisa Ivanovna , may I ? '' 
asked Sonya . 
Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now , Nicholas did not leave Sonya 's side , and gazed at her with quite new eyes . 
It seemed to him that it was only today , thanks to that burnt-cork mustache , that he had fully learned to know her . 
And really , that evening , Sonya was brighter , more animated , and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before . 
`` So that 's what she is like ; what a fool I have been ! ''
