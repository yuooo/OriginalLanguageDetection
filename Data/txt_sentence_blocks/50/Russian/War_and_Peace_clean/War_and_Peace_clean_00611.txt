`` I expected nothing else , '' she told herself , calling her pride to her aid . 
`` I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the old lady , who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many obligations . '' 
But she could not pacify herself with these reflections ; a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit . 
Though she had firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole matter , she felt herself all the time in an awkward position . 
And when she asked herself what distressed her , she had to admit that it was her relation to Rostov . 
His cold , polite manner did not express his feeling for her -LRB- she knew that -RRB- but it concealed something , and until she could discover what that something was , she felt that she could not be at ease . 
One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her nephew 's lessons , she was informed that Rostov had called . 
With a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation , she sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room . 
Her first glance at Nicholas ' face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness , and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her . 
They spoke of the countess ' health , of their mutual friends , of the latest war news , and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise , Nicholas got up to say good-by . 
With Mademoiselle Bourienne 's help the princess had maintained the conversation very well , but at the very last moment , just when he rose , she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her , and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life , that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still , her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her , not noticing that he had risen . 
Nicholas glanced at her and , wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction , made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again looked at the princess . 
She still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face . 
He suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed . 
He wished to help her and say something pleasant , but could think of nothing to say . 
`` Good-by , Princess ! '' 
said he . 
She started , flushed , and sighed deeply . 
`` Oh , I beg your pardon , '' she said as if waking up . 
`` Are you going already , Count ? 
Well then , good-by ! 
Oh , but the cushion for the countess ! '' 
`` Wait a moment , I 'll fetch it , '' said Mademoiselle Bourienne , and she left the room . 
They both sat silent , with an occasional glance at one another . 
`` Yes , Princess , '' said Nicholas at last with a sad smile , `` it does n't seem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo , but how much water has flowed since then ! 
In what distress we all seemed to be then , yet I would give much to bring back that time ... but there 's no bringing it back . '' 
Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this . 
She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said she , `` but you have no reason to regret the past , Count . 
As I understand your present life , I think you will always recall it with satisfaction , because the self-sacrifice that fills it now ... '' `` I can not accept your praise , '' he interrupted her hurriedly . 
`` On the contrary I continually reproach myself ... . 
But this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject . '' 
His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression . 
But the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved , and it was to him that she now spoke . 
`` I thought you would allow me to tell you this , '' she said . 
`` I had come so near to you ... and to all your family that I thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced , but I was mistaken , '' and suddenly her voice trembled . 
`` I do n't know why , '' she continued , recovering herself , `` but you used to be different , and ... '' `` There are a thousand reasons why , '' laying special emphasis on the why . 
`` Thank you , Princess , '' he added softly . 
`` Sometimes it is hard . '' 
`` So that 's why ! 
That 's why ! '' 
a voice whispered in Princess Mary 's soul . 
`` No , it was not only that gay , kind , and frank look , not only that handsome exterior , that I loved in him . 
I divined his noble , resolute , self-sacrificing spirit too , '' she said to herself . 
`` Yes , he is poor now and I am rich ... . 
Yes , that 's the only reason ... . 
Yes , were it not for that ... '' And remembering his former tenderness , and looking now at his kind , sorrowful face , she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness . 
`` But why , Count , why ? '' 
she almost cried , unconsciously moving closer to him . 
`` Why ?
