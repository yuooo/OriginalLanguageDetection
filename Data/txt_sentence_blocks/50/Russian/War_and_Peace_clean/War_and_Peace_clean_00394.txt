When she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down , not taking his eyes off her for some seconds . 
Then his lips and tongue moved , sounds came , and he began to speak , gazing timidly and imploringly at her , evidently afraid that she might not understand . 
Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him . 
The comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat . 
He said something , repeating the same words several times . 
She could not understand them , but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered . 
`` Mmm ... ar ... ate ... ate ... '' he repeated several times . 
It was quite impossible to understand these sounds . 
The doctor thought he had guessed them , and inquiringly repeated : `` Mary , are you afraid ? '' 
The prince shook his head , again repeated the same sounds . 
`` My mind , my mind aches ? '' 
questioned Princess Mary . 
He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this , took her hand , and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it . 
`` Always thoughts ... about you ... thoughts ... '' he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before , now that he was sure of being understood . 
Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand , trying to hide her sobs and tears . 
He moved his hand over her hair . 
`` I have been calling you all night ... '' he brought out . 
`` If only I had known ... '' she said through her tears . 
`` I was afraid to come in . '' 
He pressed her hand . 
`` Were n't you asleep ? '' 
`` No , I did not sleep , '' said Princess Mary , shaking her head . 
Unconsciously imitating her father , she now tried to express herself as he did , as much as possible by signs , and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty . 
`` Dear one ... Dearest ... '' Princess Mary could not quite make out what he had said , but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before . 
`` Why did n't you come in ? '' 
`` And I was wishing for his death ! '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
He was silent awhile . 
`` Thank you ... daughter dear ! 
... for all , for all ... forgive ! 
... thank you ! 
... forgive ! 
... thank you ! 
... '' and tears began to flow from his eyes . 
`` Call Andrew ! '' 
he said suddenly , and a childish , timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke . 
He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless . 
So at least it seemed to Princess Mary . 
`` I have a letter from him , '' she replied . 
He glanced at her with timid surprise . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
`` He 's with the army , Father , at Smolensk . '' 
He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time . 
Then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything , he nodded his head and reopened his eyes . 
`` Yes , '' he said , softly and distinctly . 
`` Russia has perished . 
They 've destroyed her . '' 
And he began to sob , and again tears flowed from his eyes . 
Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face . 
Again he closed his eyes .
