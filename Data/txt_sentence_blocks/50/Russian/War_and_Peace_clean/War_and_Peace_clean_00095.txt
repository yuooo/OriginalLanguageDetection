Go back or I 'll flatten you into a pancake , '' repeated he . 
This expression evidently pleased him . 
`` That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp , '' came a voice from behind . 
Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless , tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying . 
He saw that his championship of the doctor 's wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world -- to ridicule ; but his instinct urged him on . 
Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew , his face distorted with fury , rode up to him and raised his riding whip . 
`` Kind ... ly let -- them -- pass ! '' 
The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away . 
`` It 's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there 's this disorder , '' he muttered . 
`` Do as you like . '' 
Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor 's wife , who was calling him her deliverer , and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was . 
On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house , intending to rest if but for a moment , eat something , and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind . 
`` This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army , '' he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house , when a familiar voice called him by name . 
He turned round . 
Nesvitski 's handsome face looked out of the little window . 
Nesvitski , moving his moist lips as he chewed something , and flourishing his arm , called him to enter . 
`` Bolkonski ! 
Bolkonski ! 
... Do n't you hear ? 
Eh ? 
Come quick ... '' he shouted . 
Entering the house , Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and another adjutant having something to eat . 
They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news . 
On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm . 
This was particularly noticeable on Nesvitski 's usually laughing countenance . 
`` Where is the commander in chief ? '' 
asked Bolkonski . 
`` Here , in that house , '' answered the adjutant . 
`` Well , is it true that it 's peace and capitulation ? '' 
asked Nesvitski . 
`` I was going to ask you . 
I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here . '' 
`` And we , my dear boy ! 
It 's terrible ! 
I was wrong to laugh at Mack , we 're getting it still worse , '' said Nesvitski . 
`` But sit down and have something to eat . '' 
`` You wo n't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now , Prince . 
And God only knows where your man Peter is , '' said the other adjutant . 
`` Where are headquarters ? '' 
`` We are to spend the night in Znaim . '' 
`` Well , I have got all I need into packs for two horses , '' said Nesvitski . 
`` They 've made up splendid packs for me -- fit to cross the Bohemian mountains with . 
It 's a bad lookout , old fellow ! 
But what 's the matter with you ? 
You must be ill to shiver like that , '' he added , noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock . 
`` It 's nothing , '' replied Prince Andrew . 
He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor 's wife and the convoy officer . 
`` What is the commander in chief doing here ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I ca n't make out at all , '' said Nesvitski .
