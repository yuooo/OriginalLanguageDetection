The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkov spoke , and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov 's reply . 
`` And how do you get on with the officers ? '' 
inquired Zherkov . 
`` All right . 
They are good fellows . 
And how have you wriggled onto the staff ? '' 
`` I was attached ; I 'm on duty . '' 
Both were silent . 
`` She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve , '' went the song , arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness . 
Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song . 
`` Is it true that Austrians have been beaten ? '' 
asked Dolokhov . 
`` The devil only knows ! 
They say so . '' 
`` I 'm glad , '' answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly , as the song demanded . 
`` I say , come round some evening and we 'll have a game of faro ! '' 
said Zherkov . 
`` Why , have you too much money ? '' 
`` Do come . '' 
`` I ca n't . 
I 've sworn not to . 
I wo n't drink and wo n't play till I get reinstated . '' 
`` Well , that 's only till the first engagement . '' 
`` We shall see . '' 
They were again silent . 
`` Come if you need anything . 
One can at least be of use on the staff ... '' Dolokhov smiled . 
`` Do n't trouble . 
If I want anything , I wo n't beg - I 'll take it ! '' 
`` Well , never mind ; I only ... '' `` And I only ... '' `` Good-by . '' 
`` Good health ... '' `` It 's a long , long way . 
To my native land ... '' Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs ; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start , then settled down , galloped past the company , and overtook the carriage , still keeping time to the song . 
On returning from the review , Kutuzov took the Austrian general into his private room and , calling his adjutant , asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival , and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand , who was in command of the advanced army . 
Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the room with the required papers . 
Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out . 
`` Ah ! 
... '' said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait , and he went on with the conversation in French . 
`` All I can say , General , '' said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word . 
It was evident that Kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice . 
`` All I can say , General , is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes , the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago . 
I should long ago have joined the archduke . 
And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general -- of whom Austria has so many -- and to lay down all this heavy responsibility . 
But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us , General . '' 
And Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say , `` You are quite at liberty not to believe me and I do n't even care whether you do or not , but you have no grounds for telling me so . 
And that is the whole point . '' 
The Austrian general looked dissatisfied , but had no option but to reply in the same tone . 
`` On the contrary , '' he said , in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words , `` on the contrary , your excellency 's participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty ; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles , '' he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence . 
Kutuzov bowed with the same smile . 
`` But that is my conviction , and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me , I imagine that the Austrian troops , under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack , have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid , '' said Kutuzov . 
The general frowned .
