She had grown thin and pale , but that was not what made her unrecognizable ; she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life , now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile : only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative . 
Pierre 's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha 's part , but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face . 
`` She has come to stay with me , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` The count and countess will be here in a few days . 
The countess is in a dreadful state ; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor . 
They insisted on her coming with me . '' 
`` Yes , is there a family free from sorrow now ? '' 
said Pierre , addressing Natasha . 
`` You know it happened the very day we were rescued . 
I saw him . 
What a delightful boy he was ! '' 
Natasha looked at him , and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up . 
`` What can one say or think of as a consolation ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` Nothing ! 
Why had such a splendid boy , so full of life , to die ? '' 
`` Yes , in these days it would be hard to live without faith ... '' remarked Princess Mary . 
`` Yes , yes , that is really true , '' Pierre hastily interrupted her . 
`` Why is it true ? '' 
Natasha asked , looking attentively into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` How can you ask why ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` The thought alone of what awaits ... '' Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked inquiringly at Pierre . 
`` And because , '' Pierre continued , `` only one who believes that there is a God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and ... yours . '' 
Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped . 
Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary , asking about his friend 's last days . 
Pierre 's confusion had now almost vanished , but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone . 
He felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world . 
As he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on Natasha . 
He did not purposely say things to please her , but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint . 
Princess Mary -- reluctantly as is usual in such cases -- began telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew . 
But Pierre 's face quivering with emotion , his questions and his eager restless expression , gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake . 
`` Yes , yes , and so ... ? '' 
Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story . 
`` Yes , yes ... so he grew tranquil and softened ? 
With all his soul he had always sought one thing -- to be perfectly good -- so he could not be afraid of death . 
The faults he had -- if he had any -- were not of his making . 
So he did soften ? 
... What a happy thing that he saw you again , '' he added , suddenly turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears . 
Natasha 's face twitched . 
She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment . 
She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not . 
`` Yes , that was happiness , '' she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes . 
`` For me it certainly was happiness . '' 
She paused . 
`` And he ... he ... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered the room ... '' Natasha 's voice broke . 
She blushed , pressed her clasped hands on her knees , and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly . 
`` We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow . 
I did not dare to ask about him . 
Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with us .
