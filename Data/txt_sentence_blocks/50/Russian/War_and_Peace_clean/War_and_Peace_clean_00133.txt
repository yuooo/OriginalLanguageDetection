It 's true that all you women are crybabies , '' remarked Petya , pacing the room with large , resolute strides . 
`` Now I 'm very glad , very glad indeed , that my brother has distinguished himself so . 
You are all blubberers and understand nothing . '' 
Natasha smiled through her tears . 
`` You have n't read the letter ? '' 
asked Sonya . 
`` No , but she said that it was all over and that he 's now an officer . '' 
`` Thank God ! '' 
said Sonya , crossing herself . 
`` But perhaps she deceived you . 
Let us go to Mamma . '' 
Petya paced the room in silence for a time . 
`` If I 'd been in Nikolenka 's place I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen , '' he said . 
`` What nasty brutes they are ! 
I 'd have killed so many that there 'd have been a heap of them . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Petya , what a goose you are ! '' 
`` I 'm not a goose , but they are who cry about trifles , '' said Petya . 
`` Do you remember him ? '' 
Natasha suddenly asked , after a moment 's silence . 
Sonya smiled . 
`` Do I remember Nicholas ? '' 
`` No , Sonya , but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly , remember everything ? '' 
said Natasha , with an expressive gesture , evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning . 
`` I remember Nikolenka too , I remember him well , '' she said . 
`` But I do n't remember Boris . 
I do n't remember him a bit . '' 
`` What ! 
You do n't remember Boris ? '' 
asked Sonya in surprise . 
`` It 's not that I do n't remember -- I know what he is like , but not as I remember Nikolenka . 
Him -- I just shut my eyes and remember , but Boris ... No ! '' 
-LRB- She shut her eyes . -RRB- 
`` No ! 
there 's nothing at all . '' 
`` Oh , Natasha ! '' 
said Sonya , looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else , with whom joking was out of the question , `` I am in love with your brother once for all and , whatever may happen to him or to me , shall never cease to love him as long as I live . '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes , and said nothing . 
She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth , that there was such love as Sonya was speaking of . 
But Natasha had not yet felt anything like it . 
She believed it could be , but did not understand it . 
`` Shall you write to him ? '' 
she asked . 
Sonya became thoughtful . 
The question of how to write to Nicholas , and whether she ought to write , tormented her . 
Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero , would it be right to remind him of herself and , as it might seem , of the obligations to her he had taken on himself ? 
`` I do n't know . 
I think if he writes , I will write too , '' she said , blushing . 
`` And you wo n't feel ashamed to write to him ? '' 
Sonya smiled . 
`` No . ''
