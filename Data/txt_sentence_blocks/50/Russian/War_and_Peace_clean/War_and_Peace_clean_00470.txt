But why are you so anxious ? 
You have still time to get away ... '' `` I ca n't think what the servants are about , '' said the countess , turning to her husband . 
`` I have just been told that nothing is ready yet . 
Somebody after all must see to things . 
One misses Mitenka at such times . 
There wo n't be any end to it . '' 
The count was about to say something , but evidently restrained himself . 
He got up from his chair and went to the door . 
At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and , seeing the knot in it , pondered , shaking his head sadly and significantly . 
`` And I have a great favor to ask of you , Papa , '' said he . 
`` Hm ... '' said the count , and stopped . 
`` I was driving past Yusupov 's house just now , '' said Berg with a laugh , `` when the steward , a man I know , ran out and asked me whether I would n't buy something . 
I went in out of curiosity , you know , and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table . 
You know how dear Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it . '' 
-LRB- At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements . -RRB- 
`` And it 's such a beauty ! 
It pulls out and has a secret English drawer , you know ! 
And dear Vera has long wanted one . 
I wish to give her a surprise , you see . 
I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard . 
Please let me have one , I will pay the man well , and ... '' The count frowned and coughed . 
`` Ask the countess , I do n't give orders . '' 
`` If it 's inconvenient , please do n't , '' said Berg . 
`` Only I so wanted it , for dear Vera 's sake . '' 
`` Oh , go to the devil , all of you ! 
To the devil , the devil , the devil ... '' cried the old count . 
`` My head 's in a whirl ! '' 
And he left the room . 
The countess began to cry . 
`` Yes , Mamma ! 
Yes , these are very hard times ! '' 
said Berg . 
Natasha left the room with her father and , as if finding it difficult to reach some decision , first followed him and then ran downstairs . 
Petya was in the porch , engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave Moscow . 
The loaded carts were still standing in the yard . 
Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly . 
`` Do you know what it 's about ? '' 
Petya asked Natasha . 
She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about . 
She did not answer . 
`` It 's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded , '' said Petya . 
`` Vasilich told me . 
I consider ... '' `` I consider , '' Natasha suddenly almost shouted , turning her angry face to Petya , `` I consider it so horrid , so abominable , so ... I do n't know what . 
Are we despicable Germans ? '' 
Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and , afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste , she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs . 
Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative . 
The count , pipe in hand , was pacing up and down the room , when Natasha , her face distorted by anger , burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps . 
`` It 's horrid ! 
It 's abominable ! '' 
she screamed .
