`` Where is the princess ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Hiding ? '' 
`` She is not very well , '' answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright smile , `` so she wo n't come down . 
It is natural in her state . '' 
`` Hm ! 
Hm ! '' 
muttered the prince , sitting down . 
His plate seemed to him not quite clean , and pointing to a spot he flung it away . 
Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman . 
The little princess was not unwell , but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that , hearing he was in a bad humor , she had decided not to appear . 
`` I am afraid for the baby , '' she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne : `` Heaven knows what a fright might do . '' 
In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear , and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling . 
The prince reciprocated this antipathy , but it was overpowered by his contempt for her . 
When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills , she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne , spent whole days with her , asked her to sleep in her room , and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him . 
`` So we are to have visitors , mon prince ? '' 
remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne , unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers . 
`` His Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son , I understand ? '' 
she said inquiringly . 
`` Hm ! 
-- his excellency is a puppy ... . 
I got him his appointment in the service , '' said the prince disdainfully . 
`` Why his son is coming I do n't understand . 
Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know . 
I do n't want him . '' 
-LRB- He looked at his blushing daughter . -RRB- 
`` Are you unwell today ? 
Eh ? 
Afraid of the ` minister ' as that idiot Alpatych called him this morning ? '' 
`` No , mon pere . '' 
Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject , she did not stop talking , but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened , and after the soup the prince became more genial . 
After dinner , he went to see his daughter-in-law . 
The little princess was sitting at a small table , chattering with Masha , her maid . 
She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law . 
She was much altered . 
She was now plain rather than pretty . 
Her cheeks had sunk , her lip was drawn up , and her eyes drawn down . 
`` Yes , I feel a kind of oppression , '' she said in reply to the prince 's question as to how she felt . 
`` Do you want anything ? '' 
`` No , merci , mon pere . '' 
`` Well , all right , all right . '' 
He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with bowed head . 
`` Has the snow been shoveled back ? '' 
`` Yes , your excellency . 
Forgive me for heaven 's sake ... It was only my stupidity . '' 
`` All right , all right , '' interrupted the prince , and laughing his unnatural way , he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss , and then proceeded to his study . 
Prince Vasili arrived that evening . 
He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen , who , with loud shouts , dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow . 
Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them . 
Anatole , having taken off his overcoat , sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes .
