How I love you ! '' 
`` All right , all right ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
But Petya did not let go of him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him . 
Dolokhov kissed him , laughed , turned his horse , and vanished into the darkness . 
Having returned to the watchman 's hut , Petya found Denisov in the passage . 
He was awaiting Petya 's return in a state of agitation , anxiety , and self-reproach for having let him go . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Yes , thank God ! '' 
he repeated , listening to Petya 's rapturous account . 
`` But , devil take you , I have n't slept because of you ! 
Well , thank God . 
Now lie down . 
We can still get a nap before morning . '' 
`` But ... no , '' said Petya , `` I do n't want to sleep yet . 
Besides I know myself , if I fall asleep it 's finished . 
And then I am used to not sleeping before a battle . '' 
He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day . 
Then , noticing that Denisov was asleep , he rose and went out of doors . 
It was still quite dark outside . 
The rain was over , but drops were still falling from the trees . 
Near the watchman 's hut the black shapes of the Cossacks ' shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen . 
Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible , and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red . 
Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep ; here and there , amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by , could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering . 
Petya came out , peered into the darkness , and went up to the wagons . 
Someone was snoring under them , and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats . 
In the dark Petya recognized his own horse , which he called `` Karabakh '' though it was of Ukranian breed , and went up to it . 
`` Well , Karabakh ! 
We 'll do some service tomorrow , '' said he , sniffing its nostrils and kissing it . 
`` Why are n't you asleep , sir ? '' 
said a Cossack who was sitting under a wagon . 
`` No , ah ... Likhachev -- is n't that your name ? 
Do you know I have only just come back ! 
We 've been into the French camp . '' 
And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object , and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act `` just anyhow . '' 
`` Well , you should get some sleep now , '' said the Cossack . 
`` No , I am used to this , '' said Petya . 
`` I say , are n't the flints in your pistols worn out ? 
I brought some with me . 
Do n't you want any ? 
You can have some . '' 
The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at Petya . 
`` Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately , '' said Petya . 
`` Some fellows do things just anyhow , without preparation , and then they 're sorry for it afterwards . 
I do n't like that . '' 
`` Just so , '' said the Cossack . 
`` Oh yes , another thing ! 
Please , my dear fellow , will you sharpen my saber for me ? 
It 's got bl ... '' -LRB- Petya feared to tell a lie , and the saber never had been sharpened . -RRB-
