She was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly . 
She ran without hurry , evidently feeling sure that no one saw her . 
Rostov , holding his breath , looked round at the borzois . 
They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation . 
Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas , baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs . 
`` Ulyulyulyu ! '' 
whispered Rostov , pouting his lips . 
The borzois jumped up , jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears . 
Karay finished scratching his hindquarters and , cocking his ears , got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down . 
`` Shall I loose them or not ? '' 
Nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse . 
Suddenly the wolf 's whole physiognomy changed : she shuddered , seeing what she had probably never seen before -- human eyes fixed upon her -- and turning her head a little toward Rostov , she paused . 
`` Back or forward ? 
Eh , no matter , forward ... '' the wolf seemed to say to herself , and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet , long , easy yet resolute lope . 
`` Ulyulyu ! '' 
cried Nicholas , in a voice not his own , and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill , leaping over gullies to head off the wolf , and the borzois passed it , running faster still . 
Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping , nor see the borzois , nor the ground over which he went : he saw only the wolf , who , increasing her speed , bounded on in the same direction along the hollow . 
The first to come into view was Milka , with her black markings and powerful quarters , gaining upon the wolf . 
Nearer and nearer ... now she was ahead of it ; but the wolf turned its head to face her , and instead of putting on speed as she usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs . 
`` Ulyulyulyulyu ! '' 
shouted Nicholas . 
The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka , sprang impetuously at the wolf , and seized it by its hindquarters , but immediately jumped aside in terror . 
The wolf crouched , gnashed her teeth , and again rose and bounded forward , followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois , who did not get any closer to her . 
`` She 'll get away ! 
No , it 's impossible ! '' 
thought Nicholas , still shouting with a hoarse voice . 
`` Karay , ulyulyu ! 
... '' he shouted , looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope . 
Karay , with all the strength age had left him , stretched himself to the utmost and , watching the wolf , galloped heavily aside to intercept it . 
But the quickness of the wolf 's lope and the borzoi 's slower pace made it plain that Karay had miscalculated . 
Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it . 
But , coming toward him , he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf . 
There was still hope . 
A long , yellowish young borzoi , one Nicholas did not know , from another leash , rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over . 
But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and , gnashing her teeth , flew at the yellowish borzoi , which , with a piercing yelp , fell with its head on the ground , bleeding from a gash in its side . 
`` Karay ? 
Old fellow ! 
... '' wailed Nicholas . 
Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf 's path , the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it . 
As if aware of her danger , the wolf turned her eyes on Karay , tucked her tail yet further between her legs , and increased her speed . 
But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karay -- the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf , and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them . 
That instant , when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs , while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head , with her ears laid back -LRB- Karay was pinning her by the throat -RRB- , was the happiest moment of his life . 
With his hand on his saddlebow , he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf , when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs , and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully . 
She clicked her teeth -LRB- Karay no longer had her by the throat -RRB- , leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully , and having disengaged herself from the dogs , with tail tucked in again , went forward . 
Karay , his hair bristling , and probably bruised or wounded , climbed with difficulty out of the gully . 
`` Oh my God ! 
Why ? '' 
Nicholas cried in despair . 
`` Uncle 's '' huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf 's path and his borzois once more stopped the animal 's advance . 
She was again hemmed in .
