`` Why do you shout so ? 
You 'll frighten them ! '' 
said Boris . 
`` I did not expect you today , '' he added . 
`` I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonski -- an adjutant of Kutuzov 's , who 's a friend of mine . 
I did not think he would get it to you so quickly ... . 
Well , how are you ? 
Been under fire already ? '' 
asked Boris . 
Without answering , Rostov shook the soldier 's Cross of St. George fastened to the cording of his uniform and , indicating a bandaged arm , glanced at Berg with a smile . 
`` As you see , '' he said . 
`` Indeed ? 
Yes , yes ! '' 
said Boris , with a smile . 
`` And we too have had a splendid march . 
You know , of course , that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time , so that we had every comfort and every advantage . 
What receptions we had in Poland ! 
What dinners and balls ! 
I ca n't tell you . 
And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers . '' 
And the two friends told each other of their doings , the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line , the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family . 
`` Oh , you Guards ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` I say , send for some wine . '' 
Boris made a grimace . 
`` If you really want it , '' said he . 
He went to his bed , drew a purse from under the clean pillow , and sent for wine . 
`` Yes , and I have some money and a letter to give you , '' he added . 
Rostov took the letter and , throwing the money on the sofa , put both arms on the table and began to read . 
After reading a few lines , he glanced angrily at Berg , then , meeting his eyes , hid his face behind the letter . 
`` Well , they 've sent you a tidy sum , '' said Berg , eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa . 
`` As for us , Count , we get along on our pay . 
I can tell you for myself ... '' `` I say , Berg , my dear fellow , '' said Rostov , `` when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with , and I happen to be there , I 'll go at once , to be out of your way ! 
Do go somewhere , anywhere ... to the devil ! '' 
he exclaimed , and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face , evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words , he added , `` Do n't be hurt , my dear fellow ; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance . '' 
`` Oh , do n't mention it , Count ! 
I quite understand , '' said Berg , getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice . 
`` Go across to our hosts : they invited you , '' added Boris . 
Berg put on the cleanest of coats , without a spot or speck of dust , stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards , in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander , and , having assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed , left the room with a pleasant smile . 
`` Oh dear , what a beast I am ! '' 
muttered Rostov , as he read the letter . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Oh , what a pig I am , not to have written and to have given them such a fright ! 
Oh , what a pig I am ! '' 
he repeated , flushing suddenly . 
`` Well , have you sent Gabriel for some wine ? 
All right let 's have some ! '' 
In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhaylovna 's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son , asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it . 
`` What nonsense ! 
Much I need it ! ''
