`` I was there , '' said Pierre . 
`` Bah , really ? 
So much the better ! 
You are certainly brave foes . 
The great redoubt held out well , by my pipe ! '' 
continued the Frenchman . 
`` And you made us pay dear for it . 
I was at it three times -- sure as I sit here . 
Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures . 
Oh , it was beautiful , Monsieur Pierre ! 
Your grenadiers were splendid , by heaven ! 
I saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade . 
Fine fellows ! 
Our King of Naples , who knows what 's what , cried ` Bravo ! ' 
Ha , ha ! 
So you are one of us soldiers ! '' 
he added , smiling , after a momentary pause . 
`` So much the better , so much the better , Monsieur Pierre ! 
Terrible in battle ... gallant ... with the fair '' -LRB- he winked and smiled -RRB- , `` that 's what the French are , Monsieur Pierre , are n't they ? '' 
The captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay , so real , and so pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him . 
Probably the word `` gallant '' turned the captain 's thoughts to the state of Moscow . 
`` Apropos , tell me please , is it true that the women have all left Moscow ? 
What a queer idea ! 
What had they to be afraid of ? '' 
`` Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` Ha , ha , ha ! '' 
The Frenchman emitted a merry , sanguine chuckle , patting Pierre on the shoulder . 
`` What a thing to say ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Paris ? 
... But Paris , Paris ... '' `` Paris -- the capital of the world , '' Pierre finished his remark for him . 
The captain looked at Pierre . 
He had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing , kindly eyes . 
`` Well , if you had n't told me you were Russian , I should have wagered that you were Parisian ! 
You have that ... I do n't know what , that ... '' and having uttered this compliment , he again gazed at him in silence . 
`` I have been in Paris . 
I spent years there , '' said Pierre . 
`` Oh yes , one sees that plainly . 
Paris ! 
... A man who does n't know Paris is a savage . 
You can tell a Parisian two leagues off . 
Paris is Talma , la Duchenois , Potier , the Sorbonne , the boulevards , '' and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before , he added quickly : `` There is only one Paris in the world . 
You have been to Paris and have remained Russian . 
Well , I do n't esteem you the less for it . '' 
Under the influence of the wine he had drunk , and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts , Pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man . 
`` To return to your ladies -- I hear they are lovely . 
What a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in Moscow . 
What a chance those girls have missed ! 
Your peasants , now -- that 's another thing ; but you civilized people , you ought to know us better than that .
