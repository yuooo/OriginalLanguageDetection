said Natasha . 
`` He asked you , and Vasili Dmitrich * is also going . '' 
* Denisov . 
`` Where would I not go at the countess ' command ! '' 
said Denisov , who at the Rostovs ' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha 's knight . 
`` I 'm even weady to dance the pas de chale . '' 
`` If I have time , '' answered Nicholas . 
`` But I promised the Arkharovs ; they have a party . '' 
`` And you ? '' 
he asked Dolokhov , but as soon as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put . 
`` Perhaps , '' coldly and angrily replied Dolokhov , glancing at Sonya , and , scowling , he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at the Club dinner . 
`` There is something up , '' thought Nicholas , and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dolokhov left immediately after dinner . 
He called Natasha and asked her what was the matter . 
`` And I was looking for you , '' said Natasha running out to him . 
`` I told you , but you would not believe it , '' she said triumphantly . 
`` He has proposed to Sonya ! '' 
Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sonya of late , something seemed to give way within him at this news . 
Dolokhov was a suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless , orphan girl . 
From the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to refuse him . 
And therefore Nicholas ' first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with Sonya ... . 
He tried to say , `` That 's capital ; of course she 'll forget her childish promises and accept the offer , '' but before he had time to say it Natasha began again . 
`` And fancy ! 
she refused him quite definitely ! '' 
adding , after a pause , `` she told him she loved another . '' 
`` Yes , my Sonya could not have done otherwise ! '' 
thought Nicholas . 
`` Much as Mamma pressed her , she refused , and I know she wo n't change once she has said ... '' `` And Mamma pressed her ! '' 
said Nicholas reproachfully . 
`` Yes , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do you know , Nicholas -- do n't be angry -- but I know you will not marry her . 
I know , heaven knows how , but I know for certain that you wo n't marry her . '' 
`` Now do n't know that at all ! '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` But I must talk to her . 
What a darling Sonya is ! '' 
he added with a smile . 
`` Ah , she is indeed a darling ! 
I 'll send her to you . '' 
And Natasha kissed her brother and ran away . 
A minute later Sonya came in with a frightened , guilty , and scared look . 
Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand . 
This was the first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love . 
`` Sophie , '' he began , timidly at first and then more and more boldly , `` if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid , noble fellow ... he is my friend ... '' Sonya interrupted him . 
`` I have already refused , '' she said hurriedly . 
`` If you are refusing for my sake , I am afraid that I. . . '' 
Sonya again interrupted . 
She gave him an imploring , frightened look . 
`` Nicholas , do n't tell me that ! '' 
she said . 
`` No , but I must .
