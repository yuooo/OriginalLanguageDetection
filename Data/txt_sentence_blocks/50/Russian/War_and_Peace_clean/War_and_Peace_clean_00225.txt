Denisov was shouting . 
`` And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields . '' 
`` I have given the order again and again , your honor , but they do n't obey , '' answered the quartermaster . 
Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently : `` Let him fuss and bustle now , my job 's done and I 'm lying down -- capitally ! '' 
He could hear that Lavrushka -- that sly , bold orderly of Denisov 's -- was talking , as well as the quartermaster . 
Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons , biscuits , and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions . 
Then Denisov 's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away . 
`` Saddle ! 
Second platoon ! '' 
`` Where are they off to now ? '' 
thought Rostov . 
Five minutes later , Denisov came into the hut , climbed with muddy boots on the bed , lit his pipe , furiously scattered his things about , took his leaded whip , buckled on his saber , and went out again . 
In answer to Rostov 's inquiry where he was going , he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business . 
`` Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards ! '' 
said Denisov going out , and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud . 
He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone . 
Having got warm in his corner , he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening . 
Denisov had not yet returned . 
The weather had cleared up , and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka , laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud . 
Rostov joined them . 
In the middle of the game , the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them . 
The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them . 
`` There now , Denisov has been worrying , '' said Rostov , `` and here are the provisions . '' 
`` So they are ! '' 
said the officers . 
`` Wo n't the soldiers be glad ! '' 
A little behind the hussars came Denisov , accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking . 
Rostov went to meet them . 
`` I warn you , Captain , '' one of the officers , a short thin man , evidently very angry , was saying . 
`` Have n't I told you I wo n't give them up ? '' 
replied Denisov . 
`` You will answer for it , Captain . 
It is mutiny -- seizing the transport of one 's own army . 
Our men have had nothing to eat for two days . '' 
`` And mine have had nothing for two weeks , '' said Denisov . 
`` It is robbery ! 
You 'll answer for it , sir ! '' 
said the infantry officer , raising his voice . 
`` Now , what are you pestewing me for ? '' 
cried Denisov , suddenly losing his temper . 
`` I shall answer for it and not you , and you 'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt . 
Be off ! 
Go ! '' 
he shouted at the officers . 
`` Very well , then ! '' 
shouted the little officer , undaunted and not riding away . 
`` If you are determined to rob , I 'll ... '' `` Go to the devil ! 
quick ma ` ch , while you 're safe and sound ! '' 
and Denisov turned his horse on the officer . 
`` Very well , very well ! ''
