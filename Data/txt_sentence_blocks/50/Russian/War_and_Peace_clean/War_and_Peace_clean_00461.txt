Forty eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here , and his Serene Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets . 
Do not be upset , brothers , that the law courts are closed ; things have to be put in order , and we will deal with villains in our own way ! 
When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand , but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace . 
An ax will be useful , a hunting spear not bad , but a three-pronged fork will be best of all : a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye . 
Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water blessed . 
That will help them to get well quicker . 
I , too , am well now : one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both . 
`` But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town , '' said Pierre , `` and that the position ... '' `` Well , of course ! 
That 's what we were saying , '' replied the first speaker . 
`` And what does he mean by ` One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both ' ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` The count had a sty , '' replied the adjutant smiling , `` and was very much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him . 
By the by , Count , '' he added suddenly , addressing Pierre with a smile , `` we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess , your wife ... '' `` I have heard nothing , '' Pierre replied unconcernedly . 
`` But what have you heard ? '' 
`` Oh , well , you know people often invent things . 
I only say what I heard . '' 
`` But what did you hear ? '' 
`` Well , they say , '' continued the adjutant with the same smile , `` that the countess , your wife , is preparing to go abroad . 
I expect it 's nonsense ... '' `` Possibly , '' remarked Pierre , looking about him absent-mindedly . 
`` And who is that ? '' 
he asked , indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat , with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face . 
`` He ? 
That 's a tradesman , that is to say , he 's the restaurant keeper , Vereshchagin . 
Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation . '' 
`` Oh , so that is Vereshchagin ! '' 
said Pierre , looking at the firm , calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor . 
`` That 's not he himself , that 's the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation , '' said the adjutant . 
`` The young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him . '' 
An old gentleman wearing a star and another official , a German wearing a cross round his neck , approached the speaker . 
`` It 's a complicated story , you know , '' said the adjutant . 
`` That proclamation appeared about two months ago . 
The count was informed of it . 
He gave orders to investigate the matter . 
Gabriel Ivanovich here made the inquiries . 
The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands . 
He asked one , ` From whom did you get it ? ' 
` From so-and-so . ' 
He went to the next one . 
` From whom did you get it ? ' 
and so on till he reached Vereshchagin , a half educated tradesman , you know , ' a pet of a trader , ' '' said the adjutant smiling . 
`` They asked him , ` Who gave it you ? ' 
And the point is that we knew whom he had it from . 
He could only have had it from the Postmaster . 
But evidently they had come to some understanding . 
He replied : ` From no one ; I made it up myself . ' 
They threatened and questioned him , but he stuck to that : ' I made it up myself . ' 
And so it was reported to the count , who sent for the man . 
` From whom did you get the proclamation ? ' ' 
I wrote it myself . ' 
Well , you know the count , '' said the adjutant cheerfully , with a smile of pride , `` he flared up dreadfully -- and just think of the fellow 's audacity , lying , and obstinacy ! ''
