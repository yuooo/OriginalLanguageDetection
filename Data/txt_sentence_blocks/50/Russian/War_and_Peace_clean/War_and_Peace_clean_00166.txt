thought Rostov , when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered Moscow . 
`` Denisov ! 
We 're here ! 
He 's asleep , '' he added , leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh . 
Denisov gave no answer . 
`` There 's the corner at the crossroads , where the cabman , Zakhar , has his stand , and there 's Zakhar himself and still the same horse ! 
And here 's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread ! 
Ca n't you hurry up ? 
Now then ! '' 
`` Which house is it ? '' 
asked the driver . 
`` Why , that one , right at the end , the big one . 
Do n't you see ? 
That 's our house , '' said Rostov . 
`` Of course , it 's our house ! 
Denisov , Denisov ! 
We 're almost there ! '' 
Denisov raised his head , coughed , and made no answer . 
`` Dmitri , '' said Rostov to his valet on the box , `` those lights are in our house , are n't they ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , and there 's a light in your father 's study . '' 
`` Then they 've not gone to bed yet ? 
What do you think ? 
Mind now , do n't forget to put out my new coat , '' added Rostov , fingering his new mustache . 
`` Now then , get on , '' he shouted to the driver . 
`` Do wake up , Vaska ! '' 
he went on , turning to Denisov , whose head was again nodding . 
`` Come , get on ! 
You shall have three rubles for vodka -- get on ! '' 
Rostov shouted , when the sleigh was only three houses from his door . 
It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all . 
At last the sleigh bore to the right , drew up at an entrance , and Rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off , the porch , and the post by the side of the pavement . 
He sprang out before the sleigh stopped , and ran into the hall . 
The house stood cold and silent , as if quite regardless of who had come to it . 
There was no one in the hall . 
`` Oh God ! 
Is everyone all right ? '' 
he thought , stopping for a moment with a sinking heart , and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase . 
The well-known old door handle , which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned , turned as loosely as ever . 
A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom . 
Old Michael was asleep on the chest . 
Prokofy , the footman , who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind , sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges . 
He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement . 
`` Gracious heavens ! 
The young count ! '' 
he cried , recognizing his young master . 
`` Can it be ? 
My treasure ! '' 
and Prokofy , trembling with excitement , rushed toward the drawing-room door , probably in order to announce him , but , changing his mind , came back and stooped to kiss the young man 's shoulder . 
`` All well ? '' 
asked Rostov , drawing away his arm .
