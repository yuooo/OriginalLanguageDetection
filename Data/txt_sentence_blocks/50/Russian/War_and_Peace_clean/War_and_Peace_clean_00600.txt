It occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and time to go to bed . 
`` People speak of misfortunes and sufferings , '' remarked Pierre , `` but if at this moment I were asked : ` Would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner , or go through all this again ? ' 
then for heaven 's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh ! 
We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost , but it is only then that what is new and good begins . 
While there is life there is happiness . 
There is much , much before us . 
I say this to you , '' he added , turning to Natasha . 
`` Yes , yes , '' she said , answering something quite different . 
`` I too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning . '' 
Pierre looked intently at her . 
`` Yes , and nothing more . '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It 's not true , not true ! '' 
cried Pierre . 
`` I am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live -- nor you either . '' 
Suddenly Natasha bent her head , covered her face with her hands , and began to cry . 
`` What is it , Natasha ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Nothing , nothing . '' 
She smiled at Pierre through her tears . 
`` Good night ! 
It is time for bed . '' 
Pierre rose and took his leave . 
Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom . 
They talked of what Pierre had told them . 
Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him . 
`` Well , good night , Mary ! '' 
said Natasha . 
`` Do you know , I am often afraid that by not speaking of him '' -LRB- she meant Prince Andrew -RRB- `` for fear of not doing justice to our feelings , we forget him . '' 
Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Natasha 's remark , but she did not express agreement in words . 
`` Is it possible to forget ? '' 
said she . 
`` It did me so much good to tell all about it today . 
It was hard and painful , but good , very good ! '' 
said Natasha . 
`` I am sure he really loved him . 
That is why I told him ... Was it all right ? '' 
she added , suddenly blushing . 
`` To tell Pierre ? 
Oh , yes . 
What a splendid man he is ! '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Do you know , Mary ... '' Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time , `` he has somehow grown so clean , smooth , and fresh -- as if he had just come out of a Russian bath ; do you understand ? 
Out of a moral bath . 
Is n't it true ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Princess Mary . 
`` He has greatly improved . '' 
`` With a short coat and his hair cropped ; just as if , well , just as if he had come straight from the bath ... Papa used to ... '' `` I understand why he '' -LRB- Prince Andrew -RRB- `` liked no one so much as him , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Yes , and yet he is quite different . 
They say men are friends when they are quite different .
