That must be true . 
Really he is quite unlike him -- in everything . '' 
`` Yes , but he 's wonderful . '' 
`` Well , good night , '' said Natasha . 
And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there . 
It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night . 
He paced up and down his room , now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning , now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing , and now smiling happily . 
He was thinking of Prince Andrew , of Natasha , and of their love , at one moment jealous of her past , then reproaching himself for that feeling . 
It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room . 
`` Well , what 's to be done if it can not be avoided ? 
What 's to be done ? 
Evidently it has to be so , '' said he to himself , and hastily undressing he got into bed , happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision . 
`` Strange and impossible as such happiness seems , I must do everything that she and I may be man and wife , '' he told himself . 
A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the Friday . 
When he awoke on the Thursday , Savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey . 
`` What , to Petersburg ? 
What is Petersburg ? 
Who is there in Petersburg ? '' 
he asked involuntarily , though only to himself . 
`` Oh , yes , long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg , '' he reflected . 
`` Why ? 
But perhaps I shall go . 
What a good fellow he is and how attentive , and how he remembers everything , '' he thought , looking at Savelich 's old face , `` and what a pleasant smile he has ! '' 
`` Well , Savelich , do you still not wish to accept your freedom ? '' 
Pierre asked him . 
`` What 's the good of freedom to me , your excellency ? 
We lived under the late count -- the kingdom of heaven be his ! 
-- and we have lived under you too , without ever being wronged . '' 
`` And your children ? '' 
`` The children will live just the same . 
With such masters one can live . '' 
`` But what about my heirs ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` Supposing I suddenly marry ... it might happen , '' he added with an involuntary smile . 
`` If I may take the liberty , your excellency , it would be a good thing . '' 
`` How easy he thinks it , '' thought Pierre . 
`` He does n't know how terrible it is and how dangerous . 
Too soon or too late ... it is terrible ! '' 
`` So what are your orders ? 
Are you starting tomorrow ? '' 
asked Savelich . 
`` No , I 'll put it off for a bit . 
I 'll tell you later . 
You must forgive the trouble I have put you to , '' said Pierre , and seeing Savelich smile , he thought : `` But how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no Petersburg for me , and that that must be settled first of all ! 
But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending . 
Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks ? '' 
Pierre reflected . 
`` No , another time . '' 
At breakfast Pierre told the princess , his cousin , that he had been to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met -- `` Whom do you think ? 
Natasha Rostova ! ''
