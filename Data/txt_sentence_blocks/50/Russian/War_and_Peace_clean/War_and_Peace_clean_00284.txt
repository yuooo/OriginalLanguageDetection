`` Erza , darling ! '' 
Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own . 
Erza did not hearken to his appeal . 
At the very moment when she would have seized her prey , the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble . 
Again Erza and Milka were abreast , running like a pair of carriage horses , and began to overtake the hare , but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly . 
`` Rugay , Rugayushka ! 
That 's it , come on ! '' 
came a third voice just then , and `` Uncle 's '' red borzoi , straining and curving its back , caught up with the two foremost borzois , pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain , put on speed close to the hare , knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield , again put on speed still more viciously , sinking to his knees in the muddy field , and all one could see was how , muddying his back , he rolled over with the hare . 
A ring of borzois surrounded him . 
A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs . 
Only the delighted `` Uncle '' dismounted , and cut off a pad , shaking the hare for the blood to drip off , and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched . 
He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about . 
`` That 's it , come on ! 
That 's a dog ! 
... There , it has beaten them all , the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois . 
That 's it , come on ! '' 
said he , panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone , as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him , and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself . 
`` There are your thousand-ruble ones ... . 
That 's it , come on ! 
... '' `` Rugay , here 's a pad for you ! '' 
he said , throwing down the hare 's muddy pad . 
`` You 've deserved it , that 's it , come on ! '' 
`` She 'd tired herself out , she 'd run it down three times by herself , '' said Nicholas , also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not . 
`` But what is there in running across it like that ? '' 
said Ilagin 's groom . 
`` Once she had missed it and turned it away , any mongrel could take it , '' Ilagin was saying at the same time , breathless from his gallop and his excitement . 
At the same moment Natasha , without drawing breath , screamed joyously , ecstatically , and so piercingly that it set everyone 's ear tingling . 
By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once , and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time . 
`` Uncle '' himself twisted up the hare , threw it neatly and smartly across his horse 's back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody , and , with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone , mounted his bay and rode off . 
The others all followed , dispirited and shamefaced , and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference . 
For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who , his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash , walked along just behind `` Uncle 's '' horse with the serene air of a conqueror . 
`` Well , I am like any other dog as long as it 's not a question of coursing . 
But when it is , then look out ! '' 
his appearance seemed to Nicholas to be saying . 
When , much later , `` Uncle '' rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him , he felt flattered that , after what had happened , `` Uncle '' deigned to speak to him . 
Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas , who found that they were so far from home that he accepted `` Uncle 's '' offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of Mikhaylovna . 
`` And if you put up at my house that will be better still . 
That 's it , come on ! '' 
said `` Uncle . '' 
`` You see it 's damp weather , and you could rest , and the little countess could be driven home in a trap . '' 
`` Uncle 's '' offer was accepted . 
A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for a trap , while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to `` Uncle 's '' house . 
Some five male domestic serfs , big and little , rushed out to the front porch to meet their master . 
A score of women serfs , old and young , as well as children , popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving . 
The presence of Natasha - a woman , a lady , and on horseback -- raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her , stared her in the face , and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her . 
`` Arinka ! 
Look , she sits sideways ! 
There she sits and her skirt dangles ... . 
See , she 's got a little hunting horn ! '' 
`` Goodness gracious !
