`` But that 's the Grand Duke , and I want the commander in chief or the Emperor , '' said Rostov , and was about to spur his horse . 
`` Count ! 
Count ! '' 
shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Boris . 
`` Count ! 
I am wounded in my right hand '' -LRB- and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it -RRB- `` and I remained at the front . 
I held my sword in my left hand , Count . 
All our family -- the von Bergs -- have been knights ! '' 
He said something more , but Rostov did not wait to hear it and rode away . 
Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space , Rostov , to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged , followed the line of reserves , going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard . 
Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops , where he could never have expected the enemy to be . 
`` What can it be ? '' 
he thought . 
`` The enemy in the rear of our army ? 
Impossible ! '' 
And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle . 
`` But be that what it may , '' he reflected , `` there is no riding round it now . 
I must look for the commander in chief here , and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest . '' 
The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostov was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of Pratzen , which was full of troops of all kinds . 
`` What does it mean ? 
What is it ? 
Whom are they firing at ? 
Who is firing ? '' 
Rostov kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path . 
`` The devil knows ! 
They 've killed everybody ! 
It 's all up now ! '' 
he was told in Russian , German , and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did . 
`` Kill the Germans ! '' 
shouted one . 
`` May the devil take them -- the traitors ! '' 
`` Zum Henker diese Russen ! '' 
* muttered a German . 
* `` Hang these Russians ! '' 
Several wounded men passed along the road , and words of abuse , screams , and groans mingled in a general hubbub , then the firing died down . 
Rostov learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one another . 
`` My God ! 
What does it all mean ? '' 
thought he . 
`` And here , where at any moment the Emperor may see them ... . 
But no , these must be only a handful of scoundrels . 
It will soon be over , it ca n't be that , it ca n't be ! 
Only to get past them quicker , quicker ! '' 
The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov 's head . 
Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief , he could not , did not wish to , believe that . 
Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen . 
But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there , only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds . 
He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds , but the farther he went the more disorganized they were . 
The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches , carriages of all sorts , and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms , some wounded and some not . 
This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights .
