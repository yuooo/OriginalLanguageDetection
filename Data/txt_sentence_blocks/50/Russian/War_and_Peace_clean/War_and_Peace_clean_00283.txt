`` Of course not ! '' 
`` Or being upset because someone else 's borzoi and not mine catches something . 
All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase , is it not so , Count ? 
For I consider that ... '' `` A-tu ! '' 
came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in , who had halted . 
He stood on a knoll in the stubble , holding his whip aloft , and again repeated his long-drawn cry , `` A-tu ! '' 
-LRB- This call and the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare . -RRB- 
`` Ah , he has found one , I think , '' said Ilagin carelessly . 
`` Yes , we must ride up ... . 
Shall we both course it ? '' 
answered Nicholas , seeing in Erza and `` Uncle 's '' red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois . 
`` And suppose they outdo my Milka at once ! '' 
he thought as he rode with `` Uncle '' and Ilagin toward the hare . 
`` A full-grown one ? '' 
asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had sighted the hare -- and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to Erza . 
`` And you , Michael Nikanorovich ? '' 
he said , addressing `` Uncle . '' 
The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face . 
`` How can I join in ? 
Why , you 've given a village for each of your borzois ! 
That 's it , come on ! 
Yours are worth thousands . 
Try yours against one another , you two , and I 'll look on ! '' 
`` Rugay , hey , hey ! '' 
he shouted . 
`` Rugayushka ! '' 
he added , involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi . 
Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal , and was herself excited by it . 
The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace ; the hounds that were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare , and the whips , but not the gentlefolk , also moved away . 
All were moving slowly and sedately . 
`` How is it pointing ? '' 
asked Nicholas , riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare . 
But before the whip could reply , the hare , scenting the frost coming next morning , was unable to rest and leaped up . 
The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare , and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare . 
All the hunt , who had been moving slowly , shouted , `` Stop ! '' 
calling in the hounds , while the borzoi whips , with a cry of `` A-tu ! '' 
galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare . 
The tranquil Ilagin , Nicholas , Natasha , and `` Uncle '' flew , reckless of where and how they went , seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase . 
The hare they had started was a strong and swift one . 
When he jumped up he did not run at once , but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once . 
He took a dozen bounds , not very quickly , letting the borzois gain on him , and , finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger , laid back his ears and rushed off headlong . 
He had been lying in the stubble , but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft . 
The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him , having been the nearest , were the first to see and pursue him , but they had not gone far before Ilagin 's red-spotted Erza passed them , got within a length , flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut , and , thinking she had seized him , rolled over like a ball . 
The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly . 
From behind Erza rushed the broad-haunched , black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare . 
`` Milashka , dear ! '' 
rose Nicholas ' triumphant cry . 
It looked as if Milka would immediately pounce on the hare , but she overtook him and flew past . 
The hare had squatted . 
Again the beautiful Erza reached him , but when close to the hare 's scut paused as if measuring the distance , so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg .
