What is anyone in the world to me ? 
You alone are everything ! '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` And I will prove it to you . '' 
`` I do n't like you to talk like that . '' 
`` Well , then , I wo n't ; only forgive me , Sonya ! '' 
He drew her to him and kissed her . 
`` Oh , how nice , '' thought Natasha ; and when Sonya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her . 
`` Boris , come here , '' said she with a sly and significant look . 
`` I have something to tell you . 
Here , here ! '' 
and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding . 
Boris followed her , smiling . 
`` What is the something ? '' 
asked he . 
She grew confused , glanced round , and , seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs , picked it up . 
`` Kiss the doll , '' said she . 
Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face , but did not reply . 
`` Do n't you want to ? 
Well , then , come here , '' said she , and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll . 
`` Closer , closer ! '' 
she whispered . 
She caught the young officer by his cuffs , and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face . 
`` And me ? 
Would you like to kiss me ? '' 
she whispered almost inaudibly , glancing up at him from under her brows , smiling , and almost crying from excitement . 
Boris blushed . 
`` How funny you are ! '' 
he said , bending down to her and blushing still more , but he waited and did nothing . 
Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he , embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck , and , tossing back her hair , kissed him full on the lips . 
Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood , hanging her head . 
`` Natasha , '' he said , `` you know that I love you , but ... '' `` You are in love with me ? '' 
Natasha broke in . 
`` Yes , I am , but please do n't let us do like that ... . 
In another four years ... then I will ask for your hand . '' 
Natasha considered . 
`` Thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , '' she counted on her slender little fingers . 
`` All right ! 
Then it 's settled ? '' 
A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face . 
`` Settled ! '' 
replied Boris . 
`` Forever ? '' 
said the little girl . 
`` Till death itself ? '' 
She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room . 
After receiving her visitors , the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more , but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came `` to congratulate . '' 
The countess wished to have a tete-a-tete talk with the friend of her childhood , Princess Anna Mikhaylovna , whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , with her tear-worn but pleasant face , drew her chair nearer to that of the countess . 
`` With you I will be quite frank , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna .
