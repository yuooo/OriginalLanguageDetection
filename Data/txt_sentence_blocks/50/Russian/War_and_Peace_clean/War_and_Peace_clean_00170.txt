`` Dear me ! 
Then what are you up now ? '' 
`` Now ? '' 
repeated Natasha , and a happy smile lit up her face . 
`` Have you seen Duport ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Not seen Duport -- the famous dancer ? 
Well then , you wo n't understand . 
That 's what I 'm up to . '' 
Curving her arms , Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do , ran back a few steps , turned , cut a caper , brought her little feet sharply together , and made some steps on the very tips of her toes . 
`` See , I 'm standing ! 
See ! '' 
she said , but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer . 
`` So that 's what I 'm up to ! 
I 'll never marry anyone , but will be a dancer . 
Only do n't tell anyone . '' 
Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov , in his bedroom , felt envious and Natasha could not help joining in . 
`` No , but do n't you think it 's nice ? '' 
she kept repeating . 
`` Nice ! 
And so you no longer wish to marry Boris ? '' 
Natasha flared up . 
`` I do n't want to marry anyone . 
And I 'll tell him so when I see him ! '' 
`` Dear me ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` But that 's all rubbish , '' Natasha chattered on . 
`` And is Denisov nice ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Yes , indeed ! '' 
`` Oh , well then , good-by : go and dress . 
Is he very terrible , Denisov ? '' 
`` Why terrible ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` No , Vaska is a splendid fellow . '' 
`` You call him Vaska ? 
That 's funny ! 
And is he very nice ? '' 
`` Very . '' 
`` Well then , be quick . 
We 'll all have breakfast together . '' 
And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe , like a ballet dancer , but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile . 
When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room , he reddened . 
He did not know how to behave with her . 
The evening before , in the first happy moment of meeting , they had kissed each other , but today they felt it could not be done ; he felt that everybody , including his mother and sisters , was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her . 
He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you - Sonya . 
But their eyes met and said thou , and exchanged tender kisses . 
Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared , by Natasha 's intermediacy , to remind him of his promise , and then thanked him for his love . 
His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her , for that would be impossible . 
`` How strange it is , '' said Vera , selecting a moment when all were silent , `` that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers . ''
