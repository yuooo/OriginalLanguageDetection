That soldier passed on , and after him came another sitting on a cart . 
`` Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to ? '' 
said an orderly , running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it . 
And he also passed on with the wagon . 
Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking . 
`` And then , old fellow , he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun ... '' a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily , with a wide swing of his arm . 
`` Yes , the ham was just delicious ... '' answered another with a loud laugh . 
And they , too , passed on , so that Nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth , or what the ham had to do with it . 
`` Bah ! 
How they scurry . 
He just sends a ball and they think they 'll all be killed , '' a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully . 
`` As it flies past me , Daddy , the ball I mean , '' said a young soldier with an enormous mouth , hardly refraining from laughing , `` I felt like dying of fright . 
I did , ` pon my word , I got that frightened ! '' 
said he , as if bragging of having been frightened . 
That one also passed . 
Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before . 
It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German , and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects . 
A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind . 
A woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman , and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds . 
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission . 
The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women , and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers ' remarks related to the two young ones . 
Every face bore almost the same smile , expressing unseemly thoughts about the women . 
`` Just see , the German sausage is making tracks , too ! '' 
`` Sell me the missis , '' said another soldier , addressing the German , who , angry and frightened , strode energetically along with downcast eyes . 
`` See how smart she 's made herself ! 
Oh , the devils ! '' 
`` There , Fedotov , you should be quartered on them ! '' 
`` I have seen as much before now , mate ! '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple , also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl . 
The German closed his eyes , signifying that he did not understand . 
`` Take it if you like , '' said the officer , giving the girl an apple . 
The girl smiled and took it . 
Nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed . 
When they had gone by , the same stream of soldiers followed , with the same kind of talk , and at last all stopped . 
As often happens , the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge , and the whole crowd had to wait . 
`` And why are they stopping ? 
There 's no proper order ! '' 
said the soldiers . 
`` Where are you shoving to ? 
Devil take you ! 
Ca n't you wait ? 
It 'll be worse if he fires the bridge . 
See , here 's an officer jammed in too '' -- different voices were saying in the crowd , as the men looked at one another , and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge . 
Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge , Nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him , of something swiftly approaching ... something big , that splashed into the water . 
`` Just see where it carries to ! '' 
a soldier near by said sternly , looking round at the sound . 
`` Encouraging us to get along quicker , '' said another uneasily . 
The crowd moved on again . 
Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball .
