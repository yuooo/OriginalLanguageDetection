Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov , having received the dispatch and verbal instructions , galloped off to the General Staff accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses . 
It was a warm , dark , autumn night . 
It had been raining for four days . 
Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky , muddy road , Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka after one o'clock at night . 
Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard , GENERAL STAFF , and throwing down his reins , he entered a dark passage . 
`` The general on duty , quick ! 
It 's very important ! '' 
said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage . 
`` He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept , '' said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper . 
`` You should wake the captain first . '' 
`` But this is very important , from General Dokhturov , '' said Bolkhovitinov , entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark . 
The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody . 
`` Your honor , your honor ! 
A courier . '' 
`` What ? 
What 's that ? 
From whom ? '' 
came a sleepy voice . 
`` From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich . 
Napoleon is at Forminsk , '' said Bolkhovitinov , unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn . 
The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself . 
`` I do n't like waking him , '' he said , fumbling for something . 
`` He is very ill . 
Perhaps this is only a rumor . '' 
`` Here is the dispatch , '' said Bolkhovitinov . 
`` My orders are to give it at once to the general on duty . '' 
`` Wait a moment , I 'll light a candle . 
You damned rascal , where do you always hide it ? '' 
said the voice of the man who was stretching himself , to the orderly . 
-LRB- This was Shcherbinin , Konovnitsyn 's adjutant . -RRB- 
`` I 've found it , I 've found it ! '' 
he added . 
The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick . 
`` Oh , the nasty beasts ! '' 
said he with disgust . 
By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin 's youthful face as he held the candle , and the face of another man who was still asleep . 
This was Konovnitsyn . 
When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up , first blue and then red , Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle , from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away , and looked at the messenger . 
Bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve . 
`` Who gave the report ? '' 
inquired Shcherbinin , taking the envelope . 
`` The news is reliable , '' said Bolkhovitinov . 
`` Prisoners , Cossacks , and the scouts all say the same thing . '' 
`` There 's nothing to be done , we 'll have to wake him , '' said Shcherbinin , rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat . 
`` Peter Petrovich ! '' 
said he . 
-LRB- Konovnitsyn did not stir . -RRB- 
`` To the General Staff ! '' 
he said with a smile , knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him . 
And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once .
