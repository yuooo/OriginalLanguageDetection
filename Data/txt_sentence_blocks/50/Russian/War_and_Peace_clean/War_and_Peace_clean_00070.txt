The squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck . 
The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov , the squadron commander , known throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov . 
Cadet Rostov , ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland , had lived with the squadron commander . 
On October 11 , the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack 's defeat , the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual . 
Denisov , who had been losing at cards all night , had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition . 
Rostov in his cadet uniform , with a jerk to his horse , rode up to the porch , swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement , stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse , and at last sprang down and called to his orderly . 
`` Ah , Bondarenko , dear friend ! '' 
said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse . 
`` Walk him up and down , my dear fellow , '' he continued , with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy . 
`` Yes , your excellency , '' answered the Ukrainian gaily , tossing his head . 
`` Mind , walk him up and down well ! '' 
Another hussar also rushed toward the horse , but Bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse 's head . 
It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him . 
Rostov patted the horse 's neck and then his flank , and lingered for a moment . 
`` Splendid ! 
What a horse he will be ! '' 
he thought with a smile , and holding up his saber , his spurs jingling , he ran up the steps of the porch . 
His landlord , who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap , pitchfork in hand , was clearing manure from the cowhouse , looked out , and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rostov . 
`` Schon gut Morgen ! 
Schon gut Morgen ! '' 
* he said winking with a merry smile , evidently pleased to greet the young man . 
* `` A very good morning ! 
A very good morning ! '' 
`` Schon fleissig ? '' 
* said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face . 
`` Hoch Oestreicher ! 
Hoch Russen ! 
Kaiser Alexander hoch ! '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- said he , quoting words often repeated by the German landlord . 
* `` Busy already ? '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` Hurrah for the Austrians ! 
Hurrah for the Russians ! 
Hurrah for Emperor Alexander ! '' 
The German laughed , came out of the cowshed , pulled off his cap , and waving it above his head cried : `` Und die ganze Welt hoch ! '' 
* * `` And hurrah for the whole world ! '' 
Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing , `` Und vivat die ganze Welt ! '' 
Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing , they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love , wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection , and parted smiling , the German returning to his cowshed and Rostov going to the cottage he occupied with Denisov . 
`` What about your master ? '' 
he asked Lavrushka , Denisov 's orderly , whom all the regiment knew for a rogue . 
`` Has n't been in since the evening . 
Must have been losing , '' answered Lavrushka . 
`` I know by now , if he wins he comes back early to brag about it , but if he stays out till morning it means he 's lost and will come back in a rage . 
Will you have coffee ? '' 
`` Yes , bring some . '' 
Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee . 
`` He 's coming ! '' 
said he . 
`` Now for trouble ! '' 
Rostov looked out of the window and saw Denisov coming home . 
Denisov was a small man with a red face , sparkling black eyes , and black tousled mustache and hair .
