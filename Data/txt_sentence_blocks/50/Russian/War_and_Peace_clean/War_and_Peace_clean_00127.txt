`` Now the fun begins , '' thought Anatole , sitting down with a smile beside the old prince . 
`` Well , my dear boy , I hear you 've been educated abroad , not taught to read and write by the deacon , like your father and me . 
Now tell me , my dear boy , are you serving in the Horse Guards ? '' 
asked the old man , scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently . 
`` No , I have been transferred to the line , '' said Anatole , hardly able to restrain his laughter . 
`` Ah ! 
That 's a good thing . 
So , my dear boy , you wish to serve the Tsar and the country ? 
It is wartime . 
Such a fine fellow must serve . 
Well , are you off to the front ? '' 
`` No , Prince , our regiment has gone to the front , but I am attached ... what is it I am attached to , Papa ? '' 
said Anatole , turning to his father with a laugh . 
`` A splendid soldier , splendid ! 
` What am I attached to ! ' 
Ha , ha , ha ! '' 
laughed Prince Bolkonski , and Anatole laughed still louder . 
Suddenly Prince Bolkonski frowned . 
`` You may go , '' he said to Anatole . 
Anatole returned smiling to the ladies . 
`` And so you 've had him educated abroad , Prince Vasili , have n't you ? '' 
said the old prince to Prince Vasili . 
`` I have done my best for him , and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours . '' 
`` Yes , everything is different nowadays , everything is changed . 
The lad 's a fine fellow , a fine fellow ! 
Well , come with me now . '' 
He took Prince Vasili 's arm and led him to his study . 
As soon as they were alone together , Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince . 
`` Well , do you think I shall prevent her , that I ca n't part from her ? '' 
said the old prince angrily . 
`` What an idea ! 
I 'm ready for it tomorrow ! 
Only let me tell you , I want to know my son-in-law better . 
You know my principles -- everything aboveboard ? 
I will ask her tomorrow in your presence ; if she is willing , then he can stay on . 
He can stay and I 'll see . '' 
The old prince snorted . 
`` Let her marry , it 's all the same to me ! '' 
he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son . 
`` I will tell you frankly , '' said Prince Vasili in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted companion . 
`` You know , you see right through people . 
Anatole is no genius , but he is an honest , goodhearted lad ; an excellent son or kinsman . '' 
`` All right , all right , we 'll see ! '' 
As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society , on Anatole 's appearance all the three women of Prince Bolkonski 's household felt that their life had not been real till then . 
Their powers of reasoning , feeling , and observing immediately increased tenfold , and their life , which seemed to have been passed in darkness , was suddenly lit up by a new brightness , full of significance . 
Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure . 
The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention . 
He seemed to her kind , brave , determined , manly , and magnanimous . 
She felt convinced of that . 
Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination .
