`` I am at your disposal , '' she murmured . 
Natasha knew that she ought to go away , but was unable to do so : something gripped her throat , and regardless of manners she stared straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes . 
`` At once ? 
This instant ! 
... No , it ca n't be ! '' 
she thought . 
Again he glanced at her , and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken . 
Yes , at once , that very instant , her fate would be decided . 
`` Go , Natasha ! 
I will call you , '' said the countess in a whisper . 
Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at her mother and went out . 
`` I have come , Countess , to ask for your daughter 's hand , '' said Prince Andrew . 
The countess ' face flushed hotly , but she said nothing . 
`` Your offer ... '' she began at last sedately . 
He remained silent , looking into her eyes . 
`` Your offer ... '' -LRB- she grew confused -RRB- `` is agreeable to us , and I accept your offer . 
I am glad . 
And my husband ... I hope ... but it will depend on her ... '' `` I will speak to her when I have your consent ... . 
Do you give it to me ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Yes , '' replied the countess . 
She held out her hand to him , and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand . 
She wished to love him as a son , but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man . 
`` I am sure my husband will consent , '' said the countess , `` but your father ... '' `` My father , to whom I have told my plans , has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year . 
And I wished to tell you of that , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` It is true that Natasha is still young , but -- so long as that ? 
... '' `` It is unavoidable , '' said Prince Andrew with a sigh . 
`` I will send her to you , '' said the countess , and left the room . 
`` Lord have mercy upon us ! '' 
she repeated while seeking her daughter . 
Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom . 
Natasha was sitting on the bed , pale and dry eyed , and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself . 
Seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her . 
`` Well , Mamma ? 
... Well ? 
... '' `` Go , go to him . 
He is asking for your hand , '' said the countess , coldly it seemed to Natasha . 
`` Go ... go , '' said the mother , sadly and reproachfully , with a deep sigh , as her daughter ran away . 
Natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room . 
When she came in and saw him she paused . 
`` Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me ? '' 
she asked herself , and immediately answered , `` Yes , everything ! 
He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world . '' 
Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes . 
`` I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you . 
May I hope ? '' 
He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face . 
Her face said : `` Why ask ? 
Why doubt what you can not but know ? 
Why speak , when words can not express what one feels ? ''
