Nicholas understood that it was all over ; but he said in an indifferent tone : `` Well , wo n't you go on ? 
I had a splendid card all ready , '' as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most . 
`` It 's all up ! 
I 'm lost ! '' 
thought he . 
`` Now a bullet through my brain - that 's all that 's left me ! '' 
And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice : `` Come now , just this one more little card ! '' 
`` All right ! '' 
said Dolokhov , having finished the addition . 
`` All right ! 
Twenty-one rubles , '' he said , pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand ; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal . 
Rostov submissively unbent the corner of his card and , instead of the six thousand he had intended , carefully wrote twenty-one . 
`` It 's all the same to me , '' he said . 
`` I only want to see whether you will let me win this ten , or beat it . '' 
Dolokhov began to deal seriously . 
Oh , how Rostov detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists , which held him in their power ... . 
The ten fell to him . 
`` You owe forty-three thousand , Count , '' said Dolokhov , and stretching himself he rose from the table . 
`` One does get tired sitting so long , '' he added . 
`` Yes , I 'm tired too , '' said Rostov . 
Dolokhov cut him short , as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest . 
`` When am I to receive the money , Count ? '' 
Rostov , flushing , drew Dolokhov into the next room . 
`` I can not pay it all immediately . 
Will you take an I.O.U. ? '' 
he said . 
`` I say , Rostov , '' said Dolokhov clearly , smiling and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes , `` you know the saying , ` Lucky in love , unlucky at cards . ' 
Your cousin is in love with you , I know . '' 
`` Oh , it 's terrible to feel oneself so in this man 's power , '' thought Rostov . 
He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss , he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all , and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow , but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse . 
`` Your cousin ... '' Dolokhov started to say , but Nicholas interrupted him . 
`` My cousin has nothing to do with this and it 's not necessary to mention her ! '' 
he exclaimed fiercely . 
`` Then when am I to have it ? '' 
`` Tomorrow , '' replied Rostov and left the room . 
To say `` tomorrow '' and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult , but to go home alone , see his sisters , brother , mother , and father , confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor , was terrible . 
At home , they had not yet gone to bed . 
The young people , after returning from the theater , had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord . 
As soon as Nicholas entered , he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rostov household that winter and , now after Dolokhov 's proposal and Iogel 's ball , seemed to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm . 
Sonya and Natasha , in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater , looking pretty and conscious of it , were standing by the clavichord , happy and smiling . 
Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing room . 
The old countess , waiting for the return of her husband and son , sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house . 
Denisov , with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair , sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers , his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang , with his small , husky , but true voice , some verses called `` Enchantress , '' which he had composed , and to which he was trying to fit music : Enchantress , say , to my forsaken lyre What magic power is this recalls me still ? 
What spark has set my inmost soul on fire , What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill ? 
He was singing in passionate tones , gazing with his sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natasha . 
`` Splendid ! 
Excellent ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` Another verse , '' she said , without noticing Nicholas . 
`` Everything 's still the same with them , '' thought Nicholas , glancing into the drawing room , where he saw Vera and his mother with the old lady .
