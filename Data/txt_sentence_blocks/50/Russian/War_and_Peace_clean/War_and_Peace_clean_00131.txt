Wait a moment ! '' 
Anatole 's face seemed to say . 
Princess Mary looked at them in silence . 
She could not understand it . 
At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away . 
Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile , as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident , and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments . 
An hour later , Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince ; he added that Prince Vasili was also there . 
When Tikhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room , holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair . 
The princess ' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne 's pretty face . 
`` No , Princess , I have lost your affection forever ! '' 
said Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` Why ? 
I love you more than ever , '' said Princess Mary , `` and I will try to do all I can for your happiness . '' 
`` But you despise me . 
You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion . 
Oh , only my poor mother ... '' `` I quite understand , '' answered Princess Mary , with a sad smile . 
`` Calm yourself , my dear . 
I will go to my father , '' she said , and went out . 
Prince Vasili , with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand , was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face , as if stirred to his heart 's core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility , when Princess Mary entered . 
He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff . 
`` Ah , my dear , my dear ! '' 
he began , rising and taking her by both hands . 
Then , sighing , he added : `` My son 's fate is in your hands . 
Decide , my dear , good , gentle Marie , whom I have always loved as a daughter ! '' 
He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye . 
`` Fr ... fr ... '' snorted Prince Bolkonski . 
`` The prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil 's -- I mean , his son 's -- name . 
Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin 's wife ? 
Reply : yes or no , '' he shouted , `` and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also . 
Yes , my opinion , and only my opinion , '' added Prince Bolkonski , turning to Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look . 
`` Yes , or no ? '' 
`` My desire is never to leave you , Father , never to separate my life from yours . 
I do n't wish to marry , '' she answered positively , glancing at Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes . 
`` Humbug ! 
Nonsense ! 
Humbug , humbug , humbug ! '' 
cried Prince Bolkonski , frowning and taking his daughter 's hand ; he did not kiss her , but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it , and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry . 
Prince Vasili rose . 
`` My dear , I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never , never forget . 
But , my dear , will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart , so kind and generous ? 
Say ` perhaps ' ... The future is so long . 
Say ` perhaps . ' '' 
`` Prince , what I have said is all there is in my heart . 
I thank you for the honor , but I shall never be your son 's wife . '' 
`` Well , so that 's finished , my dear fellow ! 
I am very glad to have seen you . 
Very glad ! 
Go back to your rooms , Princess . 
Go ! '' 
said the old prince .
