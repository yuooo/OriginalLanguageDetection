`` And who has told you what is bad for another man ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Bad ! 
Bad ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre . 
`` We all know what is bad for ourselves . '' 
`` Yes , we know that , but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I can not inflict on others , '' said Prince Andrew , growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre . 
He spoke in French . 
`` I only know two very real evils in life : remorse and illness . 
The only good is the absence of those evils . 
To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now . '' 
`` And love of one 's neighbor , and self-sacrifice ? '' 
began Pierre . 
`` No , I ca n't agree with you ! 
To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough . 
I lived like that , I lived for myself and ruined my life . 
And only now when I am living , or at least trying '' -LRB- Pierre 's modesty made him correct himself -RRB- `` to live for others , only now have I understood all the happiness of life . 
No , I shall not agree with you , and you do not really believe what you are saying . '' 
Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile . 
`` When you see my sister , Princess Mary , you 'll get on with her , '' he said . 
`` Perhaps you are right for yourself , '' he added after a short pause , `` but everyone lives in his own way . 
You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others . 
I experienced just the reverse . 
I lived for glory . 
-- And after all what is glory ? 
The same love of others , a desire to do something for them , a desire for their approval . 
-- So I lived for others , and not almost , but quite , ruined my life . 
And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself . '' 
`` But what do you mean by living only for yourself ? '' 
asked Pierre , growing excited . 
`` What about your son , your sister , and your father ? '' 
`` But that 's just the same as myself -- they are not others , '' explained Prince Andrew . 
`` The others , one 's neighbors , le prochain , as you and Princess Mary call it , are the chief source of all error and evil . 
Le prochain -- your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good . '' 
And he looked at Pierre with a mocking , challenging expression . 
He evidently wished to draw him on . 
`` You are joking , '' replied Pierre , growing more and more excited . 
`` What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good , and even doing a little -- though I did very little and did it very badly ? 
What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people , our serfs , people like ourselves , were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life , retribution , recompense , and consolation ? 
What evil and error are there in it , if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered , and I supplied them with a doctor , a hospital , and an asylum for the aged ? 
And is it not a palpable , unquestionable good if a peasant , or a woman with a baby , has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure ? '' 
said Pierre , hurrying and lisping . 
`` And I have done that though badly and to a small extent ; but I have done something toward it and you can not persuade me that it was not a good action , and more than that , you ca n't make me believe that you do not think so yourself . 
And the main thing is , '' he continued , `` that I know , and know for certain , that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life . '' 
`` Yes , if you put it like that it 's quite a different matter , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I build a house and lay out a garden , and you build hospitals . 
The one and the other may serve as a pastime . 
But what 's right and what 's good must be judged by one who knows all , but not by us . 
Well , you want an argument , '' he added , `` come on then . '' 
They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda .
