Can you fancy the figure he cut ? 
... '' `` But the worst of it , gentlemen -- I am giving Kuragin away to you -- is that that man suffers , and this Don Juan , wicked fellow , is taking advantage of it ! '' 
Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm . 
He began to laugh . 
`` Tell me about that ! '' 
he said . 
`` Oh , you Don Juan ! 
You serpent ! '' 
cried several voices . 
`` You , Bolkonski , do n't know , '' said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew , `` that all the atrocities of the French army -LRB- I nearly said of the Russian army -RRB- are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women ! '' 
`` La femme est la compagne de l'homme , '' * announced Prince Hippolyte , and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs . 
* `` Woman is man 's companion . '' 
Bilibin and the rest of `` ours '' burst out laughing in Hippolyte 's face , and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte , of whom -- he had to admit -- he had almost been jealous on his wife 's account , was the butt of this set . 
`` Oh , I must give you a treat , '' Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski . 
`` Kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics -- you should see his gravity ! '' 
He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics . 
Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two . 
`` The Berlin cabinet can not express a feeling of alliance , '' began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others , `` without expressing ... as in its last note ... you understand ... Besides , unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance ... `` Wait , I have not finished ... '' he said to Prince Andrew , seizing him by the arm , `` I believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention . 
And ... '' he paused . 
`` Finally one can not impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18 . 
That is how it will end . '' 
And he released Bolkonski 's arm to indicate that he had now quite finished . 
`` Demosthenes , I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth ! '' 
said Bilibin , and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction . 
Everybody laughed , and Hippolyte louder than anyone . 
He was evidently distressed , and breathed painfully , but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features . 
`` Well now , gentlemen , '' said Bilibin , `` Bolkonski is my guest in this house and in Brunn itself . 
I want to entertain him as far as I can , with all the pleasures of life here . 
If we were in Vienna it would be easy , but here , in this wretched Moravian hole , it is more difficult , and I beg you all to help me . 
Brunn 's attractions must be shown him . 
You can undertake the theater , I society , and you , Hippolyte , of course the women . '' 
`` We must let him see Amelie , she 's exquisite ! '' 
said one of `` ours , '' kissing his finger tips . 
`` In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests , '' said Bilibin . 
`` I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality , gentlemen , it is already time for me to go , '' replied Prince Andrew looking at his watch . 
`` Where to ? '' 
`` To the Emperor . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Oh ! 
Oh ! 
Well , au revoir , Bolkonski ! 
Au revoir , Prince ! 
Come back early to dinner , '' cried several voices . 
`` We 'll take you in hand . '' 
`` When speaking to the Emperor , try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated , '' said Bilibin , accompanying him to the hall . 
`` I should like to speak well of them , but as far as I the facts , I ca n't , '' replied Bolkonski , smiling . 
`` Well , talk as much as you can , anyway . 
He has a passion for giving audiences , but he does not like talking himself and ca n't do it , as you will see . '' 
At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to , and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with to him with his long head . 
But after it was over , the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkonski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience .
