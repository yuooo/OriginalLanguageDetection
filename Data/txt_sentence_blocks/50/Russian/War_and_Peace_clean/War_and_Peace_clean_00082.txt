The black , hairy , snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov , and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber , looked just as it usually did , especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle ; he was only redder than usual . 
With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink , pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse , Bedouin , and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle , he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols . 
He rode up to Kirsten . 
The staff captain on his broad-backed , steady mare came at a walk to meet him . 
His face with its long mustache was serious as always , only his eyes were brighter than usual . 
`` Well , what about it ? '' 
said he to Denisov . 
`` It wo n't come to a fight . 
You 'll see -- we shall retire . '' 
`` The devil only knows what they 're about ! '' 
muttered Denisov . 
`` Ah , Wostov , '' he cried noticing the cadet 's bright face , `` you 've got it at last . '' 
And he smiled approvingly , evidently pleased with the cadet . 
Rostov felt perfectly happy . 
Just then the commander appeared on the bridge . 
Denisov galloped up to him . 
`` Your excellency ! 
Let us attack them ! 
I 'll dwive them off . '' 
`` Attack indeed ! '' 
said the colonel in a bored voice , puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly . 
`` And why are you stopping here ? 
Do n't you see the skirmishers are retreating ? 
Lead the squadron back . '' 
The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man . 
The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river . 
The two Pavlograd squadrons , having crossed the bridge , retired up the hill one after the other . 
Their colonel , Karl Bogdanich Schubert , came up to Denisov 's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostov , without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin . 
Rostov , feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame , did not lift his eyes from the colonel 's athletic back , his nape covered with light hair , and his red neck . 
It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him , and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet 's courage , so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily ; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage . 
Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him -- Rostov . 
Then he imagined how , after the attack , Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation . 
The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov , familiar to the Pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment , rode up to the colonel . 
After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the regiment , saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff , and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagration . 
He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard . 
`` Colonel , '' he said , addressing Rostov 's enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades , `` there is an order to stop and fire the bridge . '' 
`` An order to who ? '' 
asked the colonel morosely . 
`` I do n't myself know ` to who , ' '' replied the cornet in a serious tone , `` but the prince told me to ` go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge . ' '' 
Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order . 
After him the stout Nesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight . 
`` How 's this , Colonel ? '' 
he shouted as he approached . 
`` I told you to fire the bridge , and now someone has gone and blundered ; they are all beside themselves over there and one ca n't make anything out . '' 
The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvitski . 
`` You spoke to me of inflammable material , '' said he , `` but you said nothing about firing it . '' 
`` But , my dear sir , '' said Nesvitski as he drew up , taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand , `` was n't I telling you to fire the bridge , when inflammable material had been put in position ? '' 
`` I am not your ` dear sir , ' Mr. Staff Officer , and you did not tell me to burn the bridge ! 
I know the service , and it is my habit orders strictly to obey . 
You said the bridge would be burned , but who would it burn , I could not know by the holy spirit ! ''
