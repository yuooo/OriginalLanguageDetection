`` You do n't know what love is ... '' `` But , Natasha , can that be all over ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question . 
`` Well , then , are you refusing Prince Andrew ? '' 
said Sonya . 
`` Oh , you do n't understand anything ! 
Do n't talk nonsense , just listen ! '' 
said Natasha , with momentary vexation . 
`` But I ca n't believe it , '' insisted Sonya . 
`` I do n't understand . 
How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly ... Why , you have only seen him three times ! 
Natasha , I do n't believe you , you 're joking ! 
In three days to forget everything and so ... '' `` Three days ? '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It seems to me I 've loved him a hundred years . 
It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before . 
You ca n't understand it ... . 
Sonya , wait a bit , sit here , '' and Natasha embraced and kissed her . 
`` I had heard that it happens like this , and you must have heard it too , but it 's only now that I feel such love . 
It 's not the same as before . 
As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave , and that I could not help loving him . 
Yes , his slave ! 
Whatever he orders I shall do . 
You do n't understand that . 
What can I do ? 
What can I do , Sonya ? '' 
cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened expression . 
`` But think what you are doing , '' cried Sonya . 
`` I ca n't leave it like this . 
This secret correspondence ... How could you let him go so far ? '' 
she went on , with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal . 
`` I told you that I have no will , '' Natasha replied . 
`` Why ca n't you understand ? 
I love him ! '' 
`` Then I wo n't let it come to that ... I shall tell ! '' 
cried Sonya , bursting into tears . 
`` What do you mean ? 
For God 's sake ... If you tell , you are my enemy ! '' 
declared Natasha . 
`` You want me to be miserable , you want us to be separated ... '' When she saw Natasha 's fright , Sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend . 
`` But what has happened between you ? '' 
she asked . 
`` What has he said to you ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
Natasha did not answer her questions . 
`` For God 's sake , Sonya , do n't tell anyone , do n't torture me , '' Natasha entreated . 
`` Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters ! 
I have confided in you ... '' `` But why this secrecy ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
asked Sonya . 
`` Why does n't he openly ask for your hand ?
