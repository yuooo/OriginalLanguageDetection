His usually calm face showed excitement . 
`` There now ! 
Confess that this is delightful , '' said he . 
`` This affair of the Thabor Bridge , at Vienna ... . 
They have crossed without striking a blow ! '' 
Prince Andrew could not understand . 
`` But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows ? '' 
`` I come from the archduchess ' . 
I heard nothing there . '' 
`` And you did n't see that everybody is packing up ? '' 
`` I did not ... What is it all about ? '' 
inquired Prince Andrew impatiently . 
`` What 's it all about ? 
Why , the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending , and the bridge was not blown up : so Murat is now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or two . '' 
`` What ? 
Here ? 
But why did they not blow up the bridge , if it was mined ? '' 
`` That is what I ask you . 
No one , not even Bonaparte , knows why . '' 
Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders . 
`` But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost ? 
It will be cut off , '' said he . 
`` That 's just it , '' answered Bilibin . 
`` Listen ! 
The French entered Vienna as I told you . 
Very well . 
Next day , which was yesterday , those gentlemen , messieurs les marechaux , * Murat , Lannes , and Belliard , mount and ride to bridge . 
-LRB- Observe that all three are Gascons . -RRB- 
` Gentlemen , ' says one of them , ` you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross ? 
But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge , so let us three go and take it ! ' 
` Yes , let 's ! ' 
say the others . 
And off they go and take the bridge , cross it , and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube , marching on us , you , and your lines of communication . '' 
* The marshalls . 
`` Stop jesting , '' said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously . 
This news grieved him and yet he was pleased . 
As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position ; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame ! 
Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army , and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan . 
`` Stop this jesting , '' he said `` I am not jesting , '' Bilibin went on . 
`` Nothing is truer or sadder . 
These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs ; they assure the officer on duty that they , the marshals , are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg . 
He lets them enter the tete-de-pont . 
* They spin him a thousand gasconades , saying that the war is over , that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte , that they desire to see Prince Auersperg , and so on . 
The officer sends for Auersperg ; these gentlemen embrace the officers , crack jokes , sit on the cannon , and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved , flings the bags of incendiary material into the water , and approaches the tete-de-pont . 
At length appears the lieutenant general , our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself . 
` Dearest foe ! 
Flower of the Austrian army , hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended , we can shake one another 's hand ... . 
The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg 's acquaintance . ' 
In a word , those gentlemen , Gascons indeed , so bewildered him with fine words , and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals , and so dazzled by the sight of Murat 's mantle and ostrich plumes , qu'il n ' y voit que du feu , et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi ! '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- In spite of the animation of his speech , Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation .
