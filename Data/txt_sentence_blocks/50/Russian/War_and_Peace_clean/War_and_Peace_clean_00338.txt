One of Pierre 's acquaintances , while they were talking about the weather , asked if he had heard of Kuragin 's abduction of Rostova which was talked of in the town , and was it true ? 
Pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs ' . 
He asked everyone about Anatole . 
One man told him he had not come yet , and another that he was coming to dinner . 
Pierre felt it strange to see this calm , indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul . 
He paced through the ballroom , waited till everyone had come , and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home . 
Anatole , for whom Pierre was looking , dined that day with Dolokhov , consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair . 
It seemed to him essential to see Natasha . 
In the evening he drove to his sister 's to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting . 
When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow , his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess . 
The countess ' drawing room was full of guests . 
Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return -- at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever - entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him . 
`` Ah , Pierre , '' said the countess going up to her husband . 
`` You do n't know what a plight our Anatole ... '' She stopped , seeing in the forward thrust of her husband 's head , in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait , the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with Dolokhov . 
`` Where you are , there is vice and evil ! '' 
said Pierre to his wife . 
`` Anatole , come with me ! 
I must speak to you , '' he added in French . 
Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively , ready to follow Pierre . 
Pierre , taking him by the arm , pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room . 
`` If you allow yourself in my drawing room ... '' whispered Helene , but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room . 
Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety . 
Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him . 
`` You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to elope with her , is that so ? '' 
`` Mon cher , '' answered Anatole -LRB- their whole conversation was in French -RRB- , `` I do n't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone . '' 
Pierre 's face , already pale , became distorted by fury . 
He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till Anatole 's face showed a sufficient degree of terror . 
`` When I tell you that I must talk to you ! 
... '' repeated Pierre . 
`` Come now , this is stupid . 
What ? '' 
said Anatole , fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth . 
`` You 're a scoundrel and a blackguard , and I do n't know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this ! '' 
said Pierre , expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French . 
He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly , but at once put it back in its place . 
`` Did you promise to marry her ? '' 
`` I. . . 
I did n't think of it . 
I never promised , because ... '' Pierre interrupted him . 
`` Have you any letters of hers ? 
Any letters ? '' 
he said , moving toward Anatole . 
Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook . 
Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and , pushing aside a table that stood in his way , threw himself on the sofa . 
`` I sha n't be violent , do n't be afraid ! '' 
said Pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of Anatole 's . 
`` First , the letters , '' said he , as if repeating a lesson to himself . 
`` Secondly , '' he continued after a short pause , again rising and again pacing the room , `` tomorrow you must get out of Moscow . '' 
`` But how can I ? 
... '' `` Thirdly , '' Pierre continued without listening to him , `` you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostova .
