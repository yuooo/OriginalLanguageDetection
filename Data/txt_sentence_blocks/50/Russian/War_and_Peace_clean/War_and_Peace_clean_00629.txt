she asked herself , and passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected . 
Judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as Platon Karataev . 
`` Do you know what I am thinking about ? '' 
she asked . 
`` About Platon Karataev . 
Would he have approved of you now , do you think ? '' 
Pierre was not at all surprised at this question . 
He understood his wife 's line of thought . 
`` Platon Karataev ? '' 
he repeated , and pondered , evidently sincerely trying to imagine Karataev 's opinion on the subject . 
`` He would not have understood ... yet perhaps he would . '' 
`` I love you awfully ! '' 
Natasha suddenly said . 
`` Awfully , awfully ! '' 
`` No , he would not have approved , '' said Pierre , after reflection . 
`` What he would have approved of is our family life . 
He was always so anxious to find seemliness , happiness , and peace in everything , and I should have been proud to let him see us . 
There now -- you talk of my absence , but you would n't believe what a special feeling I have for you after a separation ... '' `` Yes , I should think ... '' Natasha began . 
`` No , it 's not that . 
I never leave off loving you . 
And one could n't love more , but this is something special ... . 
Yes , of course - '' he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest . 
`` What nonsense it is , '' Natasha suddenly exclaimed , `` about honeymoons , and that the greatest happiness is at first ! 
On the contrary , now is the best of all . 
If only you did not go away ! 
Do you remember how we quarreled ? 
And it was always my fault . 
Always mine . 
And what we quarreled about -- I do n't even remember ! '' 
`` Always about the same thing , '' said Pierre with a smile . 
`` Jealo ... '' `` Do n't say it ! 
I ca n't bear it ! '' 
Natasha cried , and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively . 
`` Did you see her ? '' 
she added , after a pause . 
`` No , and if I had I should n't have recognized her . '' 
They were silent for a while . 
`` Oh , do you know ? 
While you were talking in the study I was looking at you , '' Natasha began , evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them . 
`` You are as like him as two peas - like the boy . '' 
-LRB- She meant her little son . -RRB- 
`` Oh , it 's time to go to him ... . 
The milk 's come ... . 
But I 'm sorry to leave you . '' 
They were silent for a few seconds . 
Then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak . 
Pierre began with self-satisfaction and enthusiasm , Natasha with a quiet , happy smile . 
Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue . 
`` No . 
What did you say ?
