`` Ah , and here 's Nicholas ! '' 
cried Natasha , running up to him . 
`` Is Papa at home ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I am so glad you 've come ! '' 
said Natasha , without answering him . 
`` We are enjoying ourselves ! 
Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sake ! 
Did you know ? '' 
`` No , Papa is not back yet , '' said Sonya . 
`` Nicholas , have you come ? 
Come here , dear ! '' 
called the old countess from the drawing room . 
Nicholas went to her , kissed her hand , and sitting down silently at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards . 
From the dancing room , they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Natasha to sing . 
`` All wight ! 
All wight ! '' 
shouted Denisov . 
`` It 's no good making excuses now ! 
It 's your turn to sing the ba ` cawolla -- I entweat you ! '' 
The countess glanced at her silent son . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Oh , nothing , '' said he , as if weary of being continually asked the same question . 
`` Will Papa be back soon ? '' 
`` I expect so . '' 
`` Everything 's the same with them . 
They know nothing about it ! 
Where am I to go ? '' 
thought Nicholas , and went again into the dancing room where the clavichord stood . 
Sonya was sitting at the clavichord , playing the prelude to Denisov 's favorite barcarolle . 
Natasha was preparing to sing . 
Denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes . 
Nicholas began pacing up and down the room . 
`` Why do they want to make her sing ? 
How can she sing ? 
There 's nothing to be happy about ! '' 
thought he . 
Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude . 
`` My God , I 'm a ruined and dishonored man ! 
A bullet through my brain is the only thing left me -- not singing ! '' 
his thoughts ran on . 
`` Go away ? 
But where to ? 
It 's one -- let them sing ! '' 
He continued to pace the room , looking gloomily at Denisov and the girls and avoiding their eyes . 
`` Nikolenka , what is the matter ? '' 
Sonya 's eyes fixed on him seemed to ask . 
She noticed at once that something had happened to him . 
Nicholas turned away from her .
