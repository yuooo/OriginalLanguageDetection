All wight . 
Only not by my fault ! '' 
Dolokhov began laughing . 
`` Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over ? 
But if they did catch me they 'd string me up to an aspen tree , and with all your chivalry just the same . '' 
He paused . 
`` However , we must get to work . 
Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit . 
I have two French uniforms in it . 
Well , are you coming with me ? '' 
he asked Petya . 
`` I ? 
Yes , yes , certainly ! '' 
cried Petya , blushing almost to tears and glancing at Denisov . 
While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done with prisoners , Petya had once more felt awkward and restless ; but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about . 
`` If grown-up , distinguished men think so , it must be necessary and right , '' thought he . 
`` But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine that I 'll obey him and that he can order me about . 
I will certainly go to the French camp with Dolokhov . 
If he can , so can I ! '' 
And to all Denisov 's persuasions , Petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow , and that he never considered personal danger . 
`` For you 'll admit that if we do n't know for sure how many of them there are ... hundreds of lives may depend on it , while there are only two of us . 
Besides , I want to go very much and certainly will go , so do n't hinder me , '' said he . 
`` It will only make things worse ... '' Having put on French greatcoats and shakos , Petya and Dolokhov rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French camp , and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow . 
On reaching the bottom , Dolokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge . 
Petya , his heart in his mouth with excitement , rode by his side . 
`` If we 're caught , I wo n't be taken alive ! 
I have a pistol , '' whispered he . 
`` Do n't talk Russian , '' said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper , and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge : `` Qui vive ? '' 
* and the click of a musket . 
* `` Who goes there ? '' 
The blood rushed to Petya 's face and he grasped his pistol . 
`` Lanciers du 6-me , '' * replied Dolokhov , neither hastening nor slackening his horse 's pace . 
* `` Lancers of the 6th Regiment . '' 
The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge . 
`` Mot d'ordre . '' 
* * `` Password . '' 
Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk . 
`` Dites donc , le colonel Gerard est ici ? '' 
* he asked . 
* `` Tell me , is Colonel Gerard here ? '' 
`` Mot d'ordre , '' repeated the sentinel , barring the way and not replying . 
`` Quand un officier fait sa ronde , les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre ... '' cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel . 
`` Je vous demande si le colonel est ici . '' 
* * `` When an officer is making his round , sentinels do n't ask him for the password ... . 
I am asking you if the colonel is here . '' 
And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel , who had stepped aside , Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk . 
Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road , Dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were . 
The man , a soldier with a sack over his shoulder , stopped , came close up to Dolokhov 's horse , touched it with his hand , and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm , as he called the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden up the road , on both sides of which French talk could be heard around the campfires , Dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden in , he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire , around which sat several men talking noisily .
