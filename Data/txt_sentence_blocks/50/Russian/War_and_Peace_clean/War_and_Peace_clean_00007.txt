The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili in the anteroom . 
All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear . 
`` How about my son Boris , Prince ? '' 
said she , hurrying after him into the anteroom . 
`` I ca n't remain any longer in Petersburg . 
Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy . '' 
Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady , even betraying some impatience , she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile , and took his hand that he might not go away . 
`` What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor , and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once ? '' 
said she . 
`` Believe me , Princess , I am ready to do all I can , '' answered Prince Vasili , `` but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor . 
I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn . 
That would be the best way . '' 
The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya , belonging to one of the best families in Russia , but she was poor , and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections . 
She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son . 
It was , in fact , solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna 's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte 's story . 
Prince Vasili 's words frightened her , an embittered look clouded her once handsome face , but only for a moment ; then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasili 's arm more tightly . 
`` Listen to me , Prince , '' said she . 
`` I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again , nor have I ever reminded you of my father 's friendship for you ; but now I entreat you for God 's sake to do this for my son -- and I shall always regard you as a benefactor , '' she added hurriedly . 
`` No , do n't be angry , but promise ! 
I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused . 
Be the kindhearted man you always were , '' she said , trying to smile though tears were in her eyes . 
`` Papa , we shall be late , '' said Princess Helene , turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door . 
Influence in society , however , is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last . 
Prince Vasili knew this , and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him , he would soon be unable to ask for himself , he became chary of using his influence . 
But in Princess Drubetskaya 's case he felt , after her second appeal , something like qualms of conscience . 
She had reminded him of what was quite true ; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career . 
Moreover , he could see by her manners that she was one of those women -- mostly mothers -- who , having once made up their minds , will not rest until they have gained their end , and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour , and even to make scenes . 
This last consideration moved him . 
`` My dear Anna Mikhaylovna , '' said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone , `` it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask ; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father 's memory , I will do the impossible -- your son shall be transferred to the Guards . 
Here is my hand on it . 
Are you satisfied ? '' 
`` My dear benefactor ! 
This is what I expected from you -- I knew your kindness ! '' 
He turned to go . 
`` Wait -- just a word ! 
When he has been transferred to the Guards ... '' she faltered . 
`` You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov ... recommend Boris to him as adjutant ! 
Then I shall be at rest , and then ... '' Prince Vasili smiled . 
`` No , I wo n't promise that . 
You do n't know how Kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief . 
He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants . '' 
`` No , but do promise ! 
I wo n't let you go ! 
My dear benefactor ... '' `` Papa , '' said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before , `` we shall be late . '' 
`` Well , au revoir ! 
Good-by ! 
You hear her ? '' 
`` Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor ? '' 
`` Certainly ; but about Kutuzov , I do n't promise . '' 
`` Do promise , do promise , Vasili ! ''
