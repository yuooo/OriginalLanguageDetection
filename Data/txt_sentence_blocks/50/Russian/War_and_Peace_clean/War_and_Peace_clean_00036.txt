`` What you said just now was splendid ! '' 
said his partner Julie . 
Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking . 
Pierre listened to the colonel 's speech and nodded approvingly . 
`` That 's fine , '' said he . 
`` The young man 's a real hussar ! '' 
shouted the colonel , again thumping the table . 
`` What are you making such a noise about over there ? '' 
Marya Dmitrievna 's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table . 
`` What are you thumping the table for ? '' 
she demanded of the hussar , `` and why are you exciting yourself ? 
Do you think the French are here ? '' 
`` I am speaking ze truce , '' replied the hussar with a smile . 
`` It 's all about the war , '' the count shouted down the table . 
`` You know my son 's going , Marya Dmitrievna ? 
My son is going . '' 
`` I have four sons in the army but still I do n't fret . 
It is all in God 's hands . 
You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle , '' replied Marya Dmitrievna 's deep voice , which easily carried the whole length of the table . 
`` That 's true ! '' 
Once more the conversations concentrated , the ladies ' at the one end and the men 's at the other . 
`` You wo n't ask , '' Natasha 's little brother was saying ; `` I know you wo n't ask ! '' 
`` I will , '' replied Natasha . 
Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution . 
She half rose , by a glance inviting Pierre , who sat opposite , to listen to what was coming , and turning to her mother : `` Mamma ! '' 
rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice , audible the whole length of the table . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the countess , startled ; but seeing by her daughter 's face that it was only mischief , she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head . 
The conversation was hushed . 
`` Mamma ! 
What sweets are we going to have ? '' 
and Natasha 's voice sounded still more firm and resolute . 
The countess tried to frown , but could not . 
Marya Dmitrievna shook her fat finger . 
`` Cossack ! '' 
she said threateningly . 
Most of the guests , uncertain how to regard this sally , looked at the elders . 
`` You had better take care ! '' 
said the countess . 
`` Mamma ! 
What sweets are we going to have ? '' 
Natasha again cried boldly , with saucy gaiety , confident that her prank would be taken in good part . 
Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter . 
`` You see ! 
I have asked , '' whispered Natasha to her little brother and to Pierre , glancing at him again . 
`` Ice pudding , but you wo n't get any , '' said Marya Dmitrievna . 
Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` Marya Dmitrievna ! 
What kind of ice pudding ? 
I do n't like ice cream . ''
