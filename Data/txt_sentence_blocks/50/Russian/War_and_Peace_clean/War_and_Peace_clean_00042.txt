`` I know the will was made , but I also know that it is invalid ; and you , mon cousin , seem to consider me a perfect fool , '' said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging . 
`` My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna , '' began Prince Vasili impatiently , `` I came here not to wrangle with you , but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman , a good , kind , true relation . 
And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre 's favor are among the count 's papers , then , my dear girl , you and your sisters are not heiresses ! 
If you do n't believe me , then believe an expert . 
I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich '' -LRB- the family solicitor -RRB- `` and he says the same . '' 
At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ' ideas ; her thin lips grew white , though her eyes did not change , and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect . 
`` That would be a fine thing ! '' 
said she . 
`` I never wanted anything and I do n't now . '' 
She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress . 
`` And this is gratitude -- this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake ! '' 
she cried . 
`` It 's splendid ! 
Fine ! 
I do n't want anything , Prince . '' 
`` Yes , but you are not the only one . 
There are your sisters ... '' replied Prince Vasili . 
But the princess did not listen to him . 
`` Yes , I knew it long ago but had forgotten . 
I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness , deceit , envy , intrigue , and ingratitude -- the blackest ingratitude -- in this house ... '' `` Do you or do you not know where that will is ? '' 
insisted Prince Vasili , his cheeks twitching more than ever . 
`` Yes , I was a fool ! 
I still believed in people , loved them , and sacrificed myself . 
But only the base , the vile succeed ! 
I know who has been intriguing ! '' 
The princess wished to rise , but the prince held her by the hand . 
She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race . 
She gave her companion an angry glance . 
`` There is still time , my dear . 
You must remember , Catiche , that it was all done casually in a moment of anger , of illness , and was afterwards forgotten . 
Our duty , my dear , is to rectify his mistake , to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice , and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who ... '' `` Who sacrificed everything for him , '' chimed in the princess , who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast , `` though he never could appreciate it . 
No , mon cousin , '' she added with a sigh , `` I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward , that in this world there is neither honor nor justice . 
In this world one has to be cunning and cruel . '' 
`` Now come , come ! 
Be reasonable . 
I know your excellent heart . '' 
`` No , I have a wicked heart . '' 
`` I know your heart , '' repeated the prince . 
`` I value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me . 
Do n't upset yourself , and let us talk sensibly while there is still time , be it a day or be it but an hour ... . 
Tell me all you know about the will , and above all where it is . 
You must know . 
We will take it at once and show it to the count . 
He has , no doubt , forgotten it and will wish to destroy it . 
You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes ; that is my only reason for being here . 
I came simply to help him and you . '' 
`` Now I see it all ! 
I know who has been intriguing -- I know ! '' 
cried the princess . 
`` That 's not the point , my dear . ''
