Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor . 
`` Marya Dmitrievna , for God 's sake let me in to her ! '' 
she pleaded , but Marya Dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer ... `` Disgusting , abominable ... In my house ... horrid girl , hussy ! 
I 'm only sorry for her father ! '' 
thought she , trying to restrain her wrath . 
`` Hard as it may be , I 'll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count . '' 
She entered the room with resolute steps . 
Natasha lying on the sofa , her head hidden in her hands , and she did not stir . 
She was in just the same position in which Marya Dmitrievna had left her . 
`` A nice girl ! 
Very nice ! '' 
said Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` Arranging meetings with lovers in my house ! 
It 's no use pretending : you listen when I speak to you ! '' 
And Marya Dmitrievna touched her arm . 
`` Listen when when I speak ! 
You 've disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies . 
I 'd treat you differently , but I 'm sorry for your father , so I will conceal it . '' 
Natasha did not change her position , but her whole body heaved with noiseless , convulsive sobs which choked her . 
Marya Dmitrievna glanced round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha . 
`` It 's lucky for him that he escaped me ; but I 'll find him ! '' 
she said in her rough voice . 
`` Do you hear what I am saying or not ? '' 
she added . 
She put her large hand under Natasha 's face and turned it toward her . 
Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they saw how Natasha looked . 
Her eyes were dry and glistening , her lips compressed , her cheeks sunken . 
`` Let me be ! 
... What is it to me ? 
... I shall die ! '' 
she muttered , wrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna 's hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position . 
`` Natalie ! '' 
said Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` I wish for your good . 
Lie still , stay like that then , I wo n't touch you . 
But listen . 
I wo n't tell you how guilty you are . 
You know that yourself . 
But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him ? 
Eh ? '' 
Again Natasha 's body shook with sobs . 
`` Suppose he finds out , and your brother , and your betrothed ? '' 
`` I have no betrothed : I have refused him ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` That 's all the same , '' continued Dmitrievna . 
`` If they hear of this , will they let it pass ? 
He , your father , I know him ... if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` Oh , let me be ! 
Why have you interfered at all ?
