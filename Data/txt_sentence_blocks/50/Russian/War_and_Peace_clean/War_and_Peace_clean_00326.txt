You know Prince Andrew gave you complete freedom -- if it is really so ; but I do n't believe it ! 
Natasha , have you considered what these secret reasons can be ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment . 
Evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it . 
`` I do n't know what the reasons are . 
But there must be reasons ! '' 
Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously . 
`` If there were reasons ... '' she began . 
But Natasha , guessing her doubts , interrupted her in alarm . 
`` Sonya , one ca n't doubt him ! 
One ca n't , one ca n't ! 
Do n't you understand ? '' 
she cried . 
`` Does he love you ? '' 
`` Does he love me ? '' 
Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend 's lack of comprehension . 
`` Why , you have read his letter and you have seen him . '' 
`` But if he is dishonorable ? '' 
`` He ! 
dishonorable ? 
If you only knew ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you ; and if you wo n't do this , I will . 
I will write to him , and I will tell Papa ! '' 
said Sonya resolutely . 
`` But I ca n't live without him ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I do n't understand you . 
And what are you saying ! 
Think of your father and of Nicholas . '' 
`` I do n't want anyone , I do n't love anyone but him . 
How dare you say he is dishonorable ? 
Do n't you know that I love him ? '' 
screamed Natasha . 
`` Go away , Sonya ! 
I do n't want to quarrel with you , but go , for God 's sake go ! 
You see how I am suffering ! '' 
Natasha cried angrily , in a voice of despair and repressed irritation . 
Sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room . 
Natasha went to the table and without a moment 's reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning . 
In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end ; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom , she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her , but that she could not be his wife . 
At that moment this all seemed quite easy , simple , and clear to Natasha . 
On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country , but on Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow . 
On the day the count left , Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the Karagins ' , and Marya Dmitrievna took them there . 
At that party Natasha again met Anatole , and Sonya noticed that she spoke to him , trying not to be overheard , and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever . 
When they got home Natasha was the first to begin the explanation Sonya expected . 
`` There , Sonya , you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him , '' Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised . 
`` We have had an explanation today . '' 
`` Well , what happened ? 
What did he say ?
