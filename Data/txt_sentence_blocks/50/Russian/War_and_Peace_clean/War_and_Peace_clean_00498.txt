`` The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful , '' he suddenly said . 
`` He 's a German , but a nice fellow all the same ... . 
But he 's a German . '' 
He sat down facing Pierre . 
`` By the way , you know German , then ? '' 
Pierre looked at him in silence . 
`` What is the German for ` shelter ' ? '' 
`` Shelter ? '' 
Pierre repeated . 
`` The German for shelter is Unterkunft . '' 
`` How do you say it ? '' 
the captain asked quickly and doubtfully . 
`` Unterkunft , '' Pierre repeated . 
`` Onterkoff , '' said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes . 
`` These Germans are first-rate fools , do n't you think so , Monsieur Pierre ? '' 
he concluded . 
`` Well , let 's have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux , shall we ? 
Morel will warm us up another little bottle . 
Morel ! '' 
he called out gaily . 
Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine . 
The captain looked at Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his companion 's face . 
Ramballe , with genuine distress and sympathy in his face , went up to Pierre and bent over him . 
`` There now , we 're sad , '' said he , touching Pierre 's hand . 
`` Have I upset you ? 
No , really , have you anything against me ? '' 
he asked Pierre . 
`` Perhaps it 's the state of affairs ? '' 
Pierre did not answer , but looked cordially into the Frenchman 's eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him . 
`` Honestly , without speaking of what I owe you , I feel friendship for you . 
Can I do anything for you ? 
Dispose of me . 
It is for life and death . 
I say it with my hand on my heart ! '' 
said he , striking his chest . 
`` Thank you , '' said Pierre . 
The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that `` shelter '' was Unterkunft in German , and his face suddenly brightened . 
`` Well , in that case , I drink to our friendship ! '' 
he cried gaily , filling two glasses with wine . 
Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it . 
Ramballe emptied his too , again pressed Pierre 's hand , and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude . 
`` Yes , my dear friend , '' he began , `` such is fortune 's caprice . 
Who would have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of Bonaparte , as we used to call him ? 
Yet here I am in Moscow with him . 
I must tell you , mon cher , '' he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story , `` that our name is one of the most ancient in France . '' 
And with a Frenchman 's easy and naive frankness the captain told Pierre the story of his ancestors , his childhood , youth , and manhood , and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs , `` ma pauvre mere '' playing of course an important part in the story . 
`` But all that is only life 's setting , the real thing is love - love ! 
Am I not right , Monsieur Pierre ? '' 
said he , growing animated . 
`` Another glass ? ''
