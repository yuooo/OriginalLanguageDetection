`` The doctor has come ! '' 
cried Nina , who had been silent till then . 
A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate . 
The captain , who had been expecting the doctor all the morning , rushed headlong out to meet him . 
`` Mamma '' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air . 
Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight . 
Nina , from her invalid chair , anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy . 
The boys hurriedly took leave . 
Some of them promised to come again in the evening . 
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed . 
`` I wo n't go away , I wo n't go away , '' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha . 
`` I 'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor 's gone , I 'll come back with Perezvon . '' 
But by now the doctor had entered , an important-looking person with long , dark whiskers and a shiny , shaven chin , wearing a bearskin coat . 
As he crossed the threshold he stopped , taken aback ; he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place . 
`` How is this ? 
Where am I ? '' 
he muttered , not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap . 
The crowd , the poverty of the room , the washing hanging on a line in the corner , puzzled him . 
The captain , bent double , was bowing low before him . 
`` It 's here , sir , here , sir , '' he muttered cringingly ; `` it 's here , you 've come right , you were coming to us ... '' `` Sne-gi-ryov ? '' 
the doctor said loudly and pompously . 
`` Mr. Snegiryov - is that you ? '' 
`` That 's me , sir ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his coat , displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck . 
The captain caught the fur coat in the air , and the doctor took off his cap . 
`` Where is the patient ? '' 
he asked emphatically . 
Precocity `` WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him ? '' 
Kolya asked quickly . 
`` What a repulsive mug , though , has n't he ? 
I ca n't endure medicine ! '' 
`` Ilusha is dying . 
I think that 's certain , '' answered Alyosha , mournfully . 
`` They are rogues ! 
Medicine 's a fraud ! 
I am glad to have made your acquaintance , though , Karamazov . 
I wanted to know you for a long time . 
I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances . '' 
Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative , but he felt ill at ease . 
Alyosha noticed this , smiled , and pressed his hand . 
`` I 've long learned to respect you as a rare person , '' Kolya muttered again , faltering and uncertain . 
`` I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery . 
I know you are a mystic , but ... that has n't put me off . 
Contact with real life will cure you ... . 
It 's always so with characters like yours . '' 
`` What do you mean by mystic ? 
Cure me of what ? '' 
Alyosha was rather astonished . 
`` Oh , God and all the rest of it . ''
