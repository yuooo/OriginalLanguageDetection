My Nikita , my Nikita , you are waiting for me , '' the woman began in a sing-song voice ; but the elder had already turned away to a very old woman , dressed like a dweller in the town , not like a pilgrim . 
Her eyes showed that she had come with an object , and in order to say something . 
She said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer , and lived close by in the town . 
Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service , and had gone to Irkutsk in Siberia . 
He had written twice from there , but now a year had passed since he had written . 
She did inquire about him , but she did not know the proper place to inquire . 
`` Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna - she 's a rich merchant 's wife - said to me , ` You go , Prohorovna , and put your son 's name down for prayer in the church , and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead . 
His soul will be troubled , ' she said , ` and he will write you a letter . ' 
And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many times tried . 
Only I am in doubt ... . 
Oh , you light of ours ! 
is it true or false , and would it be right ? '' 
`` Do n't think of it . 
It 's shameful to ask the question . 
How is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul ? 
And his own mother too ! 
It 's a great sin , akin to sorcery . 
Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you . 
Better pray to the Queen of Heaven , our swift defence and help , for his good health , and that she may forgive you for your error . 
And another thing I will tell you , Prohorovna . 
Either he will soon come back to you , your son , or he will be sure to send a letter . 
Go , and henceforward be in peace . 
Your son is alive , I tell you . '' 
`` Dear Father , God reward you , our benefactor , who prays for all of us and for our sins ! '' 
But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon him . 
An exhausted , consumptive-looking , though young peasant woman was gazing at him in silence . 
Her eyes besought him , but she seemed afraid to approach . 
`` What is it , my child ? '' 
`` Absolve my soul , Father , '' she articulated softly , and slowly sank on her knees and bowed down at his feet . 
`` I have sinned , Father . 
I am afraid of my sin . '' 
The elder sat down on the lower step . 
The woman crept closer to him , still on her knees . 
`` I am a widow these three years , '' she began in a half-whisper , with a sort of shudder . 
`` I had a hard life with my husband . 
He was an old man . 
He used to beat me cruelly . 
He lay ill ; I thought looking at him , if he were to get well , if he were to get up again , what then ? 
And then the thought came to me - '' `` Stay ! '' 
said the elder , and he put his ear close to her lips . 
The woman went on in a low whisper , so that it was almost impossible to catch anything . 
She had soon done . 
`` Three years ago ? '' 
asked the elder . 
`` Three years . 
At first I did n't think about it , but now I 've begun to be ill , and the thought never leaves me . '' 
`` Have you come from far ? '' 
`` Over three hundred miles away . '' 
`` Have you told it in confession ? '' 
`` I have confessed it .
