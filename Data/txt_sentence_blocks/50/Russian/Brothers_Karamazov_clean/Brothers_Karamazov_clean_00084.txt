She must be here . 
Smerdyakov ! 
Smerdyakov ! '' 
the old man wheezed , scarcely audibly , beckoning to him with his finger . 
`` No , she 's not here , you old lunatic ! '' 
Ivan shouted at him angrily . 
`` Here , he 's fainting ? 
Water ! 
A towel ! 
Make haste , Smerdyakov ! '' 
Smerdyakov ran for water . 
At last they got the old man undressed , and put him to bed . 
They wrapped a wet towel round his head . 
Exhausted by the brandy , by his violent emotion , and the blows he had received , he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow . 
Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room . 
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase , while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor . 
`` Should n't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed , too ? '' 
Alyosha said to him . 
`` We 'll look after him . 
My brother gave you a terrible blow - on the head . '' 
`` He 's insulted me ! '' 
Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly . 
`` He 's ` insulted ' his father , not only you , '' observed Ivan with a forced smile . 
`` I used to wash him in his tub . 
He 's insulted me , '' repeated Grigory . 
`` Damn it all , if I had n't pulled him away perhaps he 'd have murdered him . 
It would n't take much to do for Aesop , would it ? '' 
whispered Ivan to Alyosha . 
`` God forbid ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Why should He forbid ? '' 
Ivan went on in the same whisper , with a malignant grimace . 
`` One reptile will devour the other . 
And serve them both right , too . '' 
Alyosha shuddered . 
`` Of course I wo n't let him be murdered as I did n't just now . 
Stay here , Alyosha , I 'll go for a turn in the yard . 
My head 's begun to ache . '' 
Alyosha went to his father 's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour . 
The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha , evidently remembering and meditating . 
All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement . 
`` Alyosha , '' he whispered apprehensively , `` where 's Ivan ? '' 
`` In the yard . 
He 's got a headache . 
He 's on the watch . '' 
`` Give me that looking-glass . 
It stands over there . 
Give it me . '' 
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the chest of drawers . 
The old man looked at himself in it ; his nose was considerably swollen , and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise .
