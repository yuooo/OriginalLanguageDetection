At that instant a stone flew into the group , but only just grazed the left-handed boy , though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy standing on the other side of the ditch . 
`` Give it him , hit him back , Smurov , '' they all shouted . 
But Smurov , the left-handed boy , needed no telling , and at once revenged himself ; he threw a stone , but it missed the boy and hit the ground . 
The boy on the other side of the ditch , the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones , flung another stone at the group ; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully on the shoulder . 
`` He aimed it at you , he meant it for you . 
You are Karamazov , Karamazov ! '' 
the boys shouted laughing , `` Come , all throw at him at once ! '' 
and six stones flew at the boy . 
One struck the boy on the head and he fell down , but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire . 
Both sides threw stones incessantly . 
Many of the group had their pockets full too . 
`` What are you about ! 
Are n't you ashamed ? 
Six against one ! 
Why , you 'll kill him , '' cried Alyosha . 
He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy . 
Three or four ceased throwing for a minute . 
`` He began first ! '' 
cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice . 
`` He is a beast , he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a penknife . 
It bled . 
Krassotkin would n't tell tales , but he must be thrashed . '' 
`` But what for ? 
I suppose you tease him . '' 
`` There , he sent a stone in your back again , he knows you , '' cried the children . 
`` It 's you he is throwing at now , not us . 
Come , all of you , at him again , do n't miss , Smurov ! '' 
and again a fire of stones , and a very vicious one , began . 
The boy on the other side of the ditch was hit in the chest ; he screamed , began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky Street . 
They all shouted : `` Aha , he is funking , he is running away . 
Wisp of tow ! '' 
`` You do n't know what a beast he is , Karamazov , killing is too good for him , '' said the boy in the jacket , with flashing eyes . 
He seemed to be the eldest . 
`` What 's wrong with him ? '' 
asked Alyosha , `` Is he a tell-tale or what ? '' 
The boys looked at one another as though derisively . 
`` Are you going that way , to Mihailovsky ? '' 
the same boy went on . 
`` Catch him up ... . 
You see he 's stopped again , he is waiting and looking at you . '' 
`` He is looking at you , '' the other boys chimed in . 
`` You ask him , does he like a dishevelled wisp of tow . 
Do you hear , ask him that ! '' 
There was a general burst of laughter . 
Alyosha looked at them , and they at him . 
`` Do n't go near him , he 'll hurt you , '' cried Smurov in a warning voice . 
`` I sha n't ask him about the wisp of tow , for I expect you tease him with that question somehow . 
But I 'll find out from him why you hate him so . '' 
`` Find out then , find out , '' cried the boys laughing . 
Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence , straight towards the boy .
