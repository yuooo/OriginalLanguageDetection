`` Oh , yes , '' he laughed gloomily . 
`` Of course , I recognise it . 
Let me have a look at it ... . 
Damn it , never mind ! '' 
`` You have forgotten to mention it , '' observed the investigating lawyer . 
`` Hang it all , I should n't have concealed it from you . 
Do you suppose I could have managed without it ? 
It simply escaped my memory . '' 
`` Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it . '' 
`` Certainly I will be so good , gentlemen . '' 
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran . 
`` But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon ? '' 
`` What object ? 
No object . 
I just picked it up and ran off . '' 
`` What for , if you had no object ? '' 
Mitya 's wrath flared up . 
He looked intently at `` the boy '' and smiled gloomily and malignantly . 
He was feeling more and more ashamed at having told `` such people '' the story of his jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously . 
`` Bother the pestle ! '' 
broke from him suddenly . 
`` But still - '' `` Oh , to keep off dogs ... Oh , because it was dark ... . 
In case anything turned up . '' 
`` But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out , since you 're afraid of the dark ? '' 
`` Ugh ! 
damn it all , gentlemen ! 
There 's positively no talking to you ! '' 
cried Mitya , exasperated beyond endurance , and turning to the secretary , crimson with anger , he said quickly , with a note of fury in his voice : `` Write down at once ... at once ... ` that I snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head with it ! ' 
Well , now are you satisfied , gentlemen ? 
Are your minds relieved ? '' 
he said , glaring defiantly at the lawyers . 
`` We quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you , which you consider trivial , though they are , in fact , essential , '' the prosecutor remarked drily in reply . 
`` Well , upon my word , gentlemen ! 
Yes , I took the pestle ... . 
What does one pick things up for at such moments ? 
I do n't know what for . 
I snatched it up and ran - that 's all . 
For to me , gentlemen , passons , or I declare I wo n't tell you any more . '' 
He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand . 
He sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall , struggling against a feeling of nausea . 
He had , in fact , an awful inclination to get up and declare that he would n't say another word , `` not if you hang me for it . '' 
`` You see , gentlemen , '' he said at last , with difficulty controlling himself , `` you see . 
I listen to you and am haunted by a dream ... . 
It 's a dream I have sometimes , you know ... . 
I often dream it - it 's always the same ... that someone is hunting me , someone I 'm awfully afraid of ... that he 's hunting me in the dark , in the night ... tracking me , and I hide somewhere from him , behind a door or cupboard , hide in a degrading way , and the worst of it is , he always knows where I am , but he pretends not to know where I am on purpose , to prolong my agony , to enjoy my terror ... . 
That 's just what you 're doing now . 
It 's just like that ! '' 
`` Is that the sort of thing you dream about ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor . 
`` Yes , it is .
