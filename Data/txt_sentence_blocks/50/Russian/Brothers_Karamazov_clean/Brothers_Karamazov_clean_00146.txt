And yet how she attracted me ! 
How attractive she was just now when I made my speech ! 
And do you know she attracts me awfully even now , yet how easy it is to leave her . 
Do you think I am boasting ? '' 
`` No , only perhaps it was n't love . '' 
`` Alyosha , '' laughed Ivan , `` do n't make reflections about love , it 's unseemly for you . 
How you rushed into the discussion this morning ! 
I 've forgotten to kiss you for it ... . 
But how she tormented me ! 
It certainly was sitting by a ` laceration . ' 
Ah , she knew how I loved her ! 
She loved me and not Dmitri , '' Ivan insisted gaily . 
`` Her feeling for Dmitri was simply a self-laceration . 
All I told her just now was perfectly true , but the worst of it is , it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she does n't care for Dmitri , and loves me whom she torments , and perhaps she may never find it out at all , in spite of her lesson to-day . 
Well , it 's better so ; I can simply go away for good . 
By the way , how is she now ? 
What happened after I departed ? '' 
Alyosha told him she had been hysterical , and that she was now , he heard , unconscious and delirious . 
`` Is n't Madame Hohlakov laying it on ? '' 
`` I think not . '' 
`` I must find out . 
Nobody dies of hysterics , though . 
They do n't matter . 
God gave woman hysterics as a relief . 
I wo n't go to her at all . 
Why push myself forward again ? '' 
`` But you told her that she had never cared for you . '' 
`` I did that on purpose . 
Alyosha , shall I call for some champagne ? 
Let us drink to my freedom . 
Ah , if only you knew how glad I am ! '' 
`` No , brother , we had better not drink , '' said Alyosha suddenly . 
`` Besides I feel somehow depressed . '' 
`` Yes , you 've been depressed a long time , I 've noticed it . '' 
`` Have you settled to go to-morrow morning , then ? '' 
`` Morning ? 
I did n't say I should go in the morning ... . 
But perhaps it may be the morning . 
Would you believe it , I dined here to-day only to avoid dining with the old man , I loathe him so . 
I should have left long ago , so far as he is concerned . 
But why are you so worried about my going away ? 
We 've plenty of time before I go , an eternity ! '' 
`` If you are going away to-morrow , what do you mean by an eternity ? '' 
`` But what does it matter to us ? '' 
laughed Ivan . 
`` We 've time enough for our talk , for what brought us here . 
Why do you look so surprised ? 
Answer : why have we met here ? 
To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna , of the old man and Dmitri ? 
of foreign travel ?
