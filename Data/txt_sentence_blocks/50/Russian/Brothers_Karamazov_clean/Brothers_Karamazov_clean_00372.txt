`` Yes , he does believe in it , '' said Lise , with flashing eyes . 
`` He does n't despise anyone , '' Alyosha went on . 
`` Only he does not believe anyone . 
If he does n't believe in people , of course , he does despise them . '' 
`` Then he despises me , me ? '' 
`` You , too . '' 
`` Good . '' 
Lise seemed to grind her teeth . 
`` When he went out laughing , I felt that it was nice to be despised . 
The child with fingers cut off is nice , and to be despised is nice ... '' And she laughed in Alyosha 's face , a feverish malicious laugh . 
`` Do you know , Alyosha , do you know , I should like - Alyosha , save me ! '' 
She suddenly jumped from the couch , rushed to him and seized him with both hands . 
`` Save me ! '' 
she almost groaned . 
`` Is there anyone in the world I could tell what I 've told you ? 
I 've told you the truth , the truth . 
I shall kill myself , because I loathe everything ! 
I do n't want to live , because I loathe everything ! 
I loathe everything , everything . 
Alyosha , why do n't you love me in the least ? '' 
she finished in a frenzy . 
`` But I do love you ! '' 
answered Alyosha warmly . 
`` And will you weep over me , will you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Not because I wo n't be your wife , but simply weep for me ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Thank you ! 
It 's only your tears I want . 
Everyone else may punish me and trample me under foot , everyone , everyone , not excepting anyone . 
For I do n't love anyone . 
Do you hear , not anyone ! 
On the contrary , I hate him ! 
Go , Alyosha ; it 's time you went to your brother '' ; she tore herself away from him suddenly . 
`` How can I leave you like this ? '' 
said Alyosha , almost in alarm . 
`` Go to your brother , the prison will be shut ; go , here 's your hat . 
Give my love to Mitya , go , go ! '' 
And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door . 
He looked at her with pained surprise , when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right hand , a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed . 
He glanced at it and instantly read the address , `` To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov . '' 
He looked quickly at Lise . 
Her face had become almost menacing . 
`` Give it to him , you must give it to him ! '' 
she ordered him , trembling and beside herself . 
`` To-day , at once , or I 'll poison myself ! 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
And she slammed the door quickly . 
The bolt clicked . 
Alyosha put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs , without going back to Madame Hohlakov ; forgetting her , in fact .
