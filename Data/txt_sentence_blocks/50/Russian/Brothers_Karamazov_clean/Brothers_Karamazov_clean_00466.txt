She heard the sick man moaning close by , all night . ' 
Yes , she heard it , but that evidence is extremely unreliable . 
I knew a lady who complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard . 
Yet the poor beast , it appeared , had only yelped once or twice in the night . 
And that 's natural . 
If anyone is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up , annoyed at being waked , but instantly falls asleep again . 
Two hours later , again a groan , he wakes up and falls asleep again ; and the same thing again two hours later - three times altogether in the night . 
Next morning the sleeper wakes up and complains that someone has been groaning all night and keeping him awake . 
And it is bound to seem so to him : the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember , he only remembers the moments of waking , so he feels he has been waked up all night . 
`` But why , why , asks the prosecutor , did not Smerdyakov confess in his last letter ? 
Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both ? 
But , excuse me , conscience implies penitence , and the suicide may not have felt penitence , but only despair . 
Despair and penitence are two very different things . 
Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable , and the suicide , laying his hands on himself , may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had envied all his life . 
`` Gentlemen of the jury , beware of a miscarriage of justice ! 
What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now ? 
Find the error in my reasoning ; find the impossibility , the absurdity . 
And if there is but a shade of possibility , but a shade of probability in my propositions , do not condemn him . 
And is there only a shade ? 
I swear by all that is sacred , I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward . 
What troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner , there is not a single one certain and irrefutable . 
And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation of these facts . 
Yes , the accumulated effect is awful : the blood , the blood dripping from his fingers , the bloodstained shirt , the dark night resounding with the shout ` Parricide ! ' 
and the old man falling with a broken head . 
And then the mass of phrases , statements , gestures , shouts ! 
Oh ! 
this has so much influence , it can so bias the mind ; but , gentlemen of the jury , can it bias your minds ? 
Remember , you have been given absolute power to bind and to loose , but the greater the power , the more terrible its responsibility . 
`` I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now , but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had stained his hands with his father 's blood . 
This is only hypothesis , I repeat ; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence . 
But , so be it , I assume that my client is guilty of parricide . 
Even so , hear what I have to say . 
I have it in my heart to say something more to you , for I feel that there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds ... . 
Forgive my referring to your hearts and minds , gentlemen of the jury , but I want to be truthful and sincere to the end . 
Let us all be sincere ! '' 
At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause . 
The last words , indeed , were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that everyone felt that he really might have something to say , and that what he was about to say would be of the greatest consequence . 
But the President , hearing the applause , in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated . 
Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto . 
A Corrupter of Thought `` IT 'S not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with ruin , gentlemen of the jury , '' he began , `` what is really damning for my client is one fact - the dead body of his father . 
Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the triviality , the incompleteness , and the fantastic character of the evidence , if you examine each part of it separately ; or , at least , you would have hesitated to ruin a man 's life simply from the prejudice against him which he has , alas ! 
only too well deserved . 
But it 's not an ordinary case of murder , it 's a case of parricide . 
That impresses men 's minds , and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind . 
How can such a prisoner be acquitted ? 
What if he committed the murder and gets off unpunished ? 
That is what everyone , almost involuntarily , instinctively , feels at heart . 
`` Yes , it 's a fearful thing to shed a father 's blood - the father who has begotten me , loved me , not spared his life for me , grieved over my illnesses from childhood up , troubled all his life for my happiness , and has lived in my joys , in my successes . 
To murder such a father - that 's inconceivable . 
Gentlemen of the jury , what is a father - a real father ?
