Is it because I am base ? 
I am not a coward . 
Is it from love of life ? 
How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself ? 
Yes , it was he told me so . '' 
`` And you are quite convinced that there has been someone here ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , on that sofa in the corner . 
You would have driven him away . 
You did drive him away : he disappeared when you arrived . 
I love your face , Alyosha . 
Did you know that I loved your face ? 
And he is myself , Alyosha . 
All that 's base in me , all that 's mean and contemptible . 
Yes , I am a romantic . 
He guessed it ... though it 's a libel . 
He is frightfully stupid ; but it 's to his advantage . 
He has cunning , animal cunning - he knew how to infuriate me . 
He kept taunting me with believing in him , and that was how he made me listen to him . 
He fooled me like a boy . 
He told me a great deal that was true about myself , though . 
I should never have owned it to myself . 
Do you know , Alyosha , '' Ivan added in an intensely earnest and confidential tone , `` I should be awfully glad to think that it was he and not I. '' `` He has worn you out , '' said Alyosha , looking compassionately at his brother . 
`` He 's been teasing me . 
And you know he does it so cleverly , so cleverly . 
` Conscience ! 
What is conscience ? 
I make it up for myself . 
Why am I tormented by it ? 
From habit . 
From the universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years . 
So let us give it up , and we shall be gods . ' 
It was he said that , it was he said that ! '' 
`` And not you , not you ? '' 
Alyosha could not help crying , looking frankly at his brother . 
`` Never mind him , anyway ; have done with him and forget him . 
And let him take with him all that you curse now , and never come back ! '' 
`` Yes , but he is spiteful . 
He laughed at me . 
He was impudent , Alyosha , '' Ivan said , with a shudder of offence . 
`` But he was unfair to me , unfair to me about lots of things . 
He told lies about me to my face . 
` Oh , you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue : to confess you murdered your father , that the valet murdered him at your instigation . ' '' 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha interposed , `` restrain yourself . 
It was not you murdered him . 
It 's not true ! '' 
`` That 's what he says , he , and he knows it . 
` You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue , and you do n't believe in virtue ; that 's what tortures you and makes you angry , that 's why you are so vindictive . ' 
He said that to me about me and he knows what he says . '' 
`` It 's you say that , not he , '' exclaimed Alyosha mournfully , `` and you say it because you are ill and delirious , tormenting yourself . ''
