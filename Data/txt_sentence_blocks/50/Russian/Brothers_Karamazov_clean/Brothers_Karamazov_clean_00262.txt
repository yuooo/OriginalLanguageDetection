`` Hurrah ! '' 
All three drank . 
Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses . 
`` Now to Russia , Panovie , and let us be brothers ! '' 
`` Pour out some for us , '' said Grushenka ; `` I 'll drink to Russia , too ! '' 
`` So will I , '' said Kalganov . 
`` And I would , too ... to Russia , the old grandmother ! '' 
tittered Maximov . 
`` All ! 
All ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Trifon Borissovitch , some more bottles ! '' 
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table . 
Mitya filled the glasses . 
`` To Russia ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
he shouted again . 
All drank the toast except the Poles , and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once . 
The Poles did not touch theirs . 
`` How 's this , Panovie ? '' 
cried Mitya , `` wo n't you drink it ? '' 
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass , raised it and said with a resonant voice : `` To Russia as she was before 1772 . '' 
`` Come , that 's better ! '' 
cried the other Pole , and they both emptied their glasses at once . 
`` You 're fools , you Panovie , '' broke suddenly from Mitya . 
`` Panie ! '' 
shouted both the Poles , menacingly , setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks . 
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious . 
`` Can one help loving one 's own country ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Be silent ! 
Do n't quarrel ! 
I wo n't have any quarrelling ! '' 
cried Grushenka imperiously , and she stamped her foot on the floor . 
Her face glowed , her eyes were shining . 
The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent . 
Mitya was terribly alarmed . 
`` Panovie , forgive me ! 
It was my fault , I 'm sorry . 
Vrublevsky , panie Vrublevsky , I 'm sorry . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , you , anyway ! 
Sit down , you stupid ! '' . 
Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance . 
Everyone sat down , all were silent , looking at one another . 
`` Gentlemen , I was the cause of it all , '' Mitya began again , unable to make anything of Grushenka 's words . 
`` Come , why are we sitting here ? 
What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again ? '' 
`` Ach , it 's certainly anything but amusing ! '' 
Kalgonov mumbled lazily . 
`` Let 's play faro again , as we did just now , '' Maximov tittered suddenly .
