Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips . 
`` Do n't touch me ... '' she faltered , in an imploring voice . 
`` Do n't touch me , till I 'm yours ... . 
I 've told you I 'm yours , but do n't touch me ... spare me ... . 
With them here , with them close , you must n't . 
He 's here . 
It 's nasty here ... '' `` I 'll obey you ! 
I wo n't think of it ... I worship you ! '' 
muttered Mitya . 
`` Yes , it 's nasty here , it 's abominable . '' 
And still holding her in his arms , he sank on his knees by the bedside . 
`` I know , though you 're a brute , you 're generous , '' Grushenka articulated with difficulty . 
`` It must be honourable ... it shall be honourable for the future ... and let us be honest , let us be good , not brutes , but good ... take me away , take me far away , do you hear ? 
I do n't want it to be here , but far , far away ... '' `` Oh , yes , yes , it must be ! '' 
said Mitya , pressing her in his arms . 
`` I 'll take you and we 'll fly away ... . 
Oh , I 'd give my whole life for one year only to know about that blood ! '' 
`` What blood ? '' 
asked Grushenka , bewildered . 
`` Nothing , '' muttered Mitya , through his teeth . 
`` Grusha , you wanted to be honest , but I 'm a thief . 
But I 've stolen money from Katya ... . 
Disgrace , a disgrace ! '' 
`` From Katya , from that young lady ? 
No , you did n't steal it . 
Give it back to her , take it from me ... . 
Why make a fuss ? 
Now everything of mine is yours . 
What does money matter ? 
We shall waste it anyway ... . 
Folks like us are bound to waste money . 
But we 'd better go and work the land . 
I want to dig the earth with my own hands . 
We must work , do you hear ? 
Alyosha said so . 
I wo n't be your mistress , I 'll be faithful to you , I 'll be your slave , I 'll work for you . 
We 'll go to the young lady and bow down to her together , so that she may forgive us , and then we 'll go away . 
And if she wo n't forgive us , we 'll go , anyway . 
Take her money and love me ... . 
Do n't love her ... . 
Do n't love her any more . 
If you love her , I shall strangle her ... . 
I 'll put out both her eyes with a needle ... '' `` I love you . 
love only you . 
I 'll love you in Siberia ... '' `` Why Siberia ? 
Never mind , Siberia , if you like . 
I do n't care ... we 'll work ... there 's snow in Siberia ... . 
I love driving in the snow ... and must have bells ... . 
Do you hear , there 's a bell ringing ? 
Where is that bell ringing ?
