How could it be ? 
They wo n't get there an hour earlier ! '' 
Andrey , a lanky , red-haired , middle-aged driver , wearing a full-skirted coat , and with a kaftan on his arm , replied warmly . 
`` Fifty roubles for vodka if we 're only an hour behind them . '' 
`` I warrant the time , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
Ech , they wo n't be half an hour before us , let alone an hour . '' 
Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things , he gave his orders strangely , as it were , disconnectedly , and inconsecutively . 
He began a sentence and forgot the end of it . 
Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to come to the rescue . 
`` Four hundred roubles ' worth , not less than four hundred roubles ' worth , just as it was then , '' commanded Mitya . 
`` Four dozen champagne , not a bottle less . '' 
`` What do you want with so much ? 
What 's it for ? 
Stay ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` What 's this box ? 
What 's in it ? 
Surely there is n't four hundred roubles ' worth here ? '' 
The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne , and only `` the most indispensable articles , '' such as savouries , sweets , toffee , etc. . 
But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off , as on the previous occasion , in a special cart also with three horses travelling at full speed , so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself . 
`` Not more than an hour ! 
Not more than an hour ! 
And put in more toffee and fondants . 
The girls there are so fond of it , '' Mitya insisted hotly . 
`` The fondants are all right . 
But what do you want with four dozen of champagne ? 
One would be enough , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , almost angry . 
He began bargaining , asking for a bill of the goods , and refused to be satisfied . 
But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles . 
In the end it was agreed that only three hundred roubles ' worth should be sent . 
`` Well , you may go to the devil ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch , on second thoughts . 
`` What 's it to do with me ? 
Throw away your money , since it 's cost you nothing . '' 
`` This way , my economist , this way , do n't be angry . '' 
Mitya drew him into a room at the back of the shop . 
`` They 'll give us a bottle here directly . 
We 'll taste it . 
Ech , Pyotr Ilyitch , come along with me , for you 're a nice fellow , the sort I like . '' 
Mitya sat down on a wicker chair , before a little table , covered with a dirty dinner-napkin . 
Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite , and the champagne soon appeared , and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen . 
`` First-class oysters , the last lot in . '' 
`` Hang the oysters . 
I do n't eat them . 
And we do n't need anything , '' cried Pyotr Ilyitch , almost angrily . 
`` There 's no time for oysters , '' said Mitya . 
`` And I 'm not hungry . 
Do you know , friend , '' he said suddenly , with feeling , `` I never have liked all this disorder . '' 
`` Who does like it ? 
Three dozen of champagne for peasants , upon my word , that 's enough to make anyone angry ! ''
