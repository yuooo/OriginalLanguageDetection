Ivan cried again . 
`` No , you are not a fool , you are far cleverer than I thought ... '' He got up , obviously intending to walk across the room . 
He was in terrible distress . 
But as the table blocked his way , and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall , he only turned round where he stood and sat down again . 
Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him , as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before . 
`` Listen , you miserable , contemptible creature ! 
Do n't you understand that if I have n't killed you , it 's simply because I am keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial . 
God sees , '' Ivan raised his hand , `` perhaps I , too , was guilty ; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father 's ... death , but I swear I was not as guilty as you think , and perhaps I did n't urge you on at all . 
No , no , I did n't urge you on ! 
But no matter , I will give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial . 
I 'm determined to ! 
I shall tell everything , everything . 
But we 'll make our appearance together . 
And whatever you may say against me at the trial , whatever evidence you give , I 'll face it ; I am not afraid of you . 
I 'll confirm it all myself ! 
But you must confess , too ! 
You must , you must ; we 'll go together . 
That 's how it shall be ! '' 
Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so . 
`` You are ill , I see ; you are quite ill . 
Your eyes are yellow , '' Smerdyakov commented , without the least irony , with apparent sympathy in fact . 
`` We 'll go together , '' Ivan repeated . 
`` And if you wo n't go , no matter , I 'll go alone . '' 
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering . 
`` There 'll be nothing of the sort , and you wo n't go , '' he concluded at last positively . 
`` You do n't understand me , '' Ivan exclaimed reproachfully . 
`` You 'll be too much ashamed , if you confess it all . 
And , what 's more , it will be no use at all , for I shall say straight out that I never said anything of the sort to you , and that you are either ill -LRB- and it looks like it , too -RRB- , or that you 're so sorry for your brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me , for you 've always thought no more of me than if I 'd been a fly . 
And who will believe you , and what single proof have you got ? '' 
`` Listen , you showed me those notes just now to convince me . '' 
Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side . 
`` Take that money away with you , '' Smerdyakov sighed . 
`` Of course , I shall take it . 
But why do you give it to me , if you committed the murder for the sake of it ? '' 
Ivan looked at him with great surprise . 
`` I do n't want it , '' Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice , with a gesture of refusal . 
`` I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow or , better still , abroad . 
I did dream of it , chiefly because ` all things are lawful . ' 
That was quite right what you taught me , for you talked a lot to me about that . 
For if there 's no everlasting God , there 's no such thing as virtue , and there 's no need of it . 
You were right there . 
So that 's how I looked at it . '' 
`` Did you come to that of yourself ? '' 
asked Ivan , with a wry smile . 
`` With your guidance . '' 
`` And now , I suppose , you believe in God , since you are giving back the money ? '' 
`` No , I do n't believe , '' whispered Smerdyakov . 
`` Then why are you giving it back ? '' 
`` Leave off ... that 's enough ! '' 
Smerdyakov waved his hand again .
