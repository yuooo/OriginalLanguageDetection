`` Yes , he summed us up , too , '' chimed in another voice , `` Do you remember , at the beginning of his speech , making out we were all like Fyodor Pavlovitch ? '' 
`` And at the end , too . 
But that was all rot . '' 
`` And obscure too . '' 
`` He was a little too much carried away . '' 
`` It 's unjust , it 's unjust . '' 
`` No , it was smartly done , anyway . 
He 's had long to wait , but he 's had his say , ha ha ! '' 
`` What will the counsel for the defence say ? '' 
In another group I heard : `` He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that ; ` appealing to your sensibilities ' - do you remember ? '' 
`` Yes , that was awkward of him . '' 
`` He was in too great a hurry . '' 
`` He is a nervous man . '' 
`` We laugh , but what must the prisoner be feeling ? '' 
`` Yes , what must it be for Mitya ? '' 
In a third group : `` What lady is that , the fat one , with the lorgnette , sitting at the end ? '' 
`` She is a general 's wife , divorced , I know her . '' 
`` That 's why she has the lorgnette . '' 
`` She is not good for much . '' 
`` Oh no , she is a piquante little woman . '' 
`` Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman , she is prettier . '' 
`` They caught him smartly at Mokroe , did n't they , eh ? '' 
`` Oh , it was smart enough . 
We 've heard it before , how often he has told the story at people 's houses ! 
`` And he could n't resist doing it now . 
That 's vanity . '' 
`` He is a man with a grievance , he he ! '' 
`` Yes , and quick to take offence . 
And there was too much rhetoric , such long sentences . '' 
`` Yes , he tries to alarm us , he kept trying to alarm us . 
Do you remember about the troika ? 
Something about ` They have Hamlets , but we have , so far , only Karamazovs ! ' 
That was cleverly said ! '' 
`` That was to propitiate the liberals . 
He is afraid of them . '' 
`` Yes , and he is afraid of the lawyer , too . '' 
`` Yes , what will Fetyukovitch say ? '' 
`` Whatever he says , he wo n't get round our peasants . '' 
`` Do n't you think so ? '' 
A fourth group : `` What he said about the troika was good , that piece about the other nations . '' 
`` And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Why , in the English Parliment a Member got up last week and speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to intervene , to educate this barbarous people . 
Ippolit was thinking of him , I know he was . 
He was talking about that last week . '' 
`` Not an easy job . '' 
`` Not an easy job ? 
Why not ? '' 
`` Why , we 'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn . 
Where would they get it ? ''
