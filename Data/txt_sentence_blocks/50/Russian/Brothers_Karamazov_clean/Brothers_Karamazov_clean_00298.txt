In fact , I , too , thought of Smerdyakov just now ; but only for a second . 
Almost at once I thought , ` No , it 's not Smerdyakov . ' 
It 's not his doing , gentlemen . '' 
`` In that case is there anybody else you suspect ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously . 
`` I do n't know anyone it could be , whether it 's the hand of Heaven or of Satan , but ... not Smerdyakov , '' Mitya jerked out with decision . 
`` But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it 's not he ? '' 
`` From my conviction - my impression . 
Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward . 
He 's not a coward , he 's the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs . 
He has the heart of a chicken . 
When he talked to me , he was always trembling for fear I should kill him , though I never raised my hand against him . 
He fell at my feet and blubbered ; he has kissed these very boots , literally , beseeching me ` not to frighten him . ' 
Do you hear ? 
` Not to frighten him . ' 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , I offered him money . 
He 's a puling chicken - sickly , epileptic , weak-minded - a child of eight could thrash him . 
He has no character worth talking about . 
It 's not Smerdyakov , gentlemen . 
He does n't care for money ; he would n't take my presents . 
Besides , what motive had he for murdering the old man ? 
Why , he 's very likely his son , you know - his natural son . 
Do you know that ? '' 
`` We have heard that legend . 
But you are your father 's son , too , you know ; yet you yourself told everyone you meant to murder him . '' 
`` That 's a thrust ! 
And a nasty , mean one , too ! 
I 'm not afraid ! 
Oh , gentlemen , is n't it too base of you to say that to my face ? 
It 's base , because I told you that myself . 
I not only wanted to murder him , but I might have done it . 
And , what 's more , I went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him . 
But , you see , I did n't murder him ; you see , my guardian angel saved me - that 's what you 've not taken into account . 
And that 's why it 's so base of you . 
For I did n't kill him , I did n't kill him ! 
Do you hear , I did not kill him . '' 
He was almost choking . 
He had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation . 
`` And what has he told you , gentlemen - Smerdyakov , I mean ? '' 
he added suddenly , after a pause . 
`` May I ask that question ? '' 
`` You may ask any question , '' the prosecutor replied with frigid severity , `` any question relating to the facts of the case , and we are , I repeat , bound to answer every inquiry you make . 
We found the servant Smerdyakov , concerning whom you inquire , lying unconscious in his bed , in an epileptic fit of extreme severity , that had recurred , possibly , ten times . 
The doctor who was with us told us , after seeing him , that he may possibly not outlive the night . '' 
`` Well , if that 's so , the devil must have killed him , '' broke suddenly from Mitya , as though until that moment had been asking himself : `` Was it Smerdyakov or not ? '' 
`` We will come back to this later , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch decided . 
`` Now would n't you like to continue your statement ? '' 
Mitya asked for a rest . 
His request was courteously granted .
