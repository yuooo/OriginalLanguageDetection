What do you think of the gold mines , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? '' 
`` Of the gold mines , madam ? 
I have never thought anything about them . '' 
`` But I have thought of them for you . 
Thought of them over and over again . 
I have been watching you for the last month . 
I 've watched you a hundred times as you 've walked past , saying to myself : That 's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold mines . 
I 've studied your gait and come to the conclusion : that 's a man who would find gold . '' 
`` From my gait , madam ? '' 
said Mitya , smiling . 
`` Yes , from your gait . 
You surely do n't deny that character can be told from the gait , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? 
Science supports the idea . 
I 'm all for science and realism now . 
After all this business with Father Zossima , which has so upset me , from this very day I 'm a realist and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness . 
I 'm cured . 
` Enough ! ' 
as Turgeney says . '' 
`` But madam , the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me - '' `` It is yours , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Madame Hohlakov cut in at once . 
`` The money is as good as in your pocket , not three thousand , but three million , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , in less than no time . 
I 'll make you a present of the idea : you shall find gold mines , make millions , return and become a leading man , and wake us up and lead us to better things . 
Are we to leave it all to the Jews ? 
You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts . 
You will help the poor , and they will bless you . 
This is the age of railways , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You 'll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance , which is so badly off at present . 
The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ; people do n't know that side of me - '' `` Madam , madam ! 
Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment . 
`` I shall indeed , perhaps , follow your advice , your wise advice , madam ... . 
I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold mines ... . 
I 'll come and see you again about it ... many times , indeed ... but now , that three thousand you so generously ... oh , that would set me free , and if you could to-day ... you see , I have n't a minute , a minute to lose to-day - '' `` Enough , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , enough ! '' 
Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically . 
`` The question is , will you go to the gold mines or not ; have you quite made up your mind ? 
Answer yes or no . '' 
`` I will go , madam , afterwards ... . 
I 'll go where you like ... but now - '' `` Wait ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
And jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers , she began pulling out one drawer after another , looking for something with desperate haste . 
`` The three thousand , '' thought Mitya , his heart almost stopping , `` and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that 's doing things in gentlemanly style ! 
She 's a splendid woman , if only she did n't talk so much ! '' 
`` Here ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , running back joyfully to Mitya , `` here is what I was looking for ! '' 
It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord , such as is sometimes worn next the skin with a cross . 
`` This is from Kiev , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' she went on reverently , `` from the relics of the Holy Martyr , Varvara . 
Let me put it on your neck myself , and with it dedicate you to a new life , to a new career . '' 
And she actually put the cord round his neck , and began arranging it . 
In extreme embarrassment , Mitya bent down and helped her , and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest . 
`` Now you can set off , '' Madame Hohlakov pronounced , sitting down triumphantly in her place again . 
`` Madam , I am so touched . 
I do n't know how to thank you , indeed ... for such kindness , but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me ... .
