`` Yes , '' Mitya jerked out . 
`` That is , what blood ? 
... and why is the cuff turned in ? '' 
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory , and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin 's . 
`` You must take off your shirt , too . 
That 's very important as material evidence . '' 
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage . 
`` What , am I to stay naked ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Do n't disturb yourself . 
We will arrange something . 
And meanwhile take off your socks . '' 
`` You 're not joking ? 
Is that really necessary ? '' 
Mitya 's eyes flashed . 
`` We are in no mood for joking , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly . 
`` Well , if I must - '' muttered Mitya , and sitting down on the bed , he took off his socks . 
He felt unbearably awkward . 
All were clothed , while he was naked , and strange to say , when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence , and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them , and that now they had a perfect right to despise him . 
`` When all are undressed , one is somehow not ashamed , but when one 's the only one undressed and everybody is looking , it 's degrading , '' he kept repeating to himself , again and again . 
`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . '' 
`` Well , am I to stay naked like this ? '' 
he added savagely . 
`` Yes , that ca n't be helped for the time ... . 
Kindly sit down here for a while . 
You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed , and I. . . 
I 'll see to all this . '' 
All the things were shown to the witnesses . 
The report of the search was drawn up , and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out , and the clothes were carried out after him . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out , too . 
Mitya was left alone with the peasants , who stood in silence , never taking their eyes off him . 
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt .
