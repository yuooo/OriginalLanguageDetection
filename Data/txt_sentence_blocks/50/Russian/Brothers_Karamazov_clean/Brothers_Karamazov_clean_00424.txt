`` No , he knows what he says . 
` You are going from pride , ' he says . 
` You 'll stand up and say it was I killed him , and why do you writhe with horror ? 
You are lying ! 
I despise your opinion , I despise your horror ! ' 
He said that about me . 
` And do you know you are longing for their praise - `` he is a criminal , a murderer , but what a generous soul ; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed . '' 
That 's a lie Alyosha ! '' 
Ivan cried suddenly , with flashing eyes . 
`` I do n't want the low rabble to praise me , I swear I do n't ! 
That 's a lie ! 
That 's why I threw the glass at him and it broke against his ugly face . '' 
`` Brother , calm yourself , stop ! '' 
Alyosha entreated him . 
`` Yes , he knows how to torment one . 
He 's cruel , '' Ivan went on , unheeding . 
`` I had an inkling from the first what he came for . 
` Granting that you go through pride , still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia , and Mitya would be acquitted , while you would only be punished , with moral condemnation ' -LRB- ` Do you hear ? ' 
he laughed then -RRB- - ` and some people will praise you . 
But now Smerdyakov 's dead , he has hanged himself , and who 'll believe you alone ? 
But yet you are going , you are going , you 'll go all the same , you 've decided to go . 
What are you going for now ? ' 
That 's awful , Alyosha . 
I ca n't endure such questions . 
Who dare ask me such questions ? '' 
`` Brother , '' interposed Alyosha - his heart sank with terror , but he still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason - `` how could he have told you of Smerdyakov 's death before I came , when no one knew of it and there was no time for anyone to know of it ? '' 
`` He told me , '' said Ivan firmly , refusing to admit a doubt . 
`` It was all he did talk about , if you come to that . 
` And it would be all right if you believed in virtue , ' he said . 
` No matter if they disbelieve you , you are going for the sake of principle . 
But you are a little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch , and what do you want with virtue ? 
Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to anyone ? 
Because you do n't know yourself why you go ! 
Oh , you 'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go ! 
And can you have made up your mind ? 
You 've not made up your mind . 
You 'll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not . 
But you will go ; you know you 'll go . 
You know that whichever way you decide , the decision does not depend on you . 
You 'll go because you wo n't dare not to go . 
Why wo n't you dare ? 
You must guess that for yourself . 
That 's a riddle for you ! ' 
He got up and went away . 
You came and he went . 
He called me a coward , Alyosha ! 
Le mot de l'enigme is that I am a coward . 
` It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth . 
` It was he added that - he ! 
And Smerdyakov said the same .
