`` But , brother , have you no hope then of being acquitted ? '' 
Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head . 
`` Alyosha , darling , it 's time you were going , '' he said , with a sudden haste . 
`` There 's the superintendent shouting in the yard . 
He 'll be here directly . 
We are late ; it 's irregular . 
Embrace me quickly . 
Kiss me ! 
Sign me with the cross , darling , for the cross I have to bear to-morrow . '' 
They embraced and kissed . 
`` Ivan , '' said Mitya suddenly , `` suggests my escaping ; but , of course , he believes I did it . '' 
A mournful smile came on to his lips . 
`` Have you asked him whether he believes it ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` No , I have n't . 
I wanted to , but I could n't . 
I had n't the courage . 
But I saw it from his eyes . 
Well , good-bye ! '' 
Once more they kissed hurriedly , and Alyosha was just going out , when Mitya suddenly called him back . 
`` Stand facing me ! 
That 's right ! '' 
And again he seized Alyosha , putting both hands on his shoulders . 
His face became suddenly quite pale , so that it was dreadfully apparent , even through the gathering darkness . 
His lips twitched , his eyes fastened upon Alyosha . 
`` Alyosha , tell me the whole truth , as you would before God . 
Do you believe I did it ? 
Do you , do you in yourself , believe it ? 
The whole truth , do n't lie ! '' 
he cried desperately . 
Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha , and he felt something like a stab at his heart . 
`` Hush ! 
What do you mean ? '' 
he faltered helplessly . 
`` The whole truth , the whole , do n't lie ! '' 
repeated Mitya . 
`` I 've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer ! '' 
broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha 's breast , and he raised his right hand in the air , as though calling God to witness his words . 
Mitya 's whole face was lighted up with bliss . 
`` Thank you ! '' 
he articulated slowly , as though letting a sigh escape him after fainting . 
`` Now you have given me new life . 
Would you believe it , till this moment I 've been afraid to ask you , you , even you . 
Well , go ! 
You 've given me strength for to-morrow . 
God bless you ! 
Come , go along ! 
Love Ivan ! '' 
was Mitya 's last word . 
Alyosha went out in tears .
