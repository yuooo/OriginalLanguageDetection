He had very important business of his own before him , something almost mysterious . 
Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya , with whom he could have left the children , would not come back from market . 
He had several times already crossed the passage , opened the door of the lodgers ' room and looked anxiously at `` the kids '' who were sitting over the book , as he had bidden them . 
Every time he opened the door they grinned at him , hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing . 
But Kolya was bothered and did not go in . 
At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind , once for all , that if that `` damned '' Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out without waiting for her , making `` the kids '' promise , of course , to be brave when he was away , not to be naughty , not to cry from fright . 
With this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar , slung his satchel round his shoulder , and , regardless of his mother 's constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold weather , he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on . 
Perezvon , seeing him in his outdoor clothes , began tapping nervously , yet vigorously , on the floor with his tail . 
Twitching all over , he even uttered a plaintive whine . 
But Kolya , seeing his dog 's passionate excitement , decided that it was a breach of discipline , kept him for another minute under the bench , and only when he had opened the door into the passage , whistled for him . 
The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously . 
Kolya opened the door to peep at `` the kids . '' 
They were both sitting as before at the table , not reading but warmly disputing about something . 
The children often argued together about various exciting problems of life , and Nastya , being the elder , always got the best of it . 
If Kostya did not agree with her , he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin , and his verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them . 
This time the `` kids '' ' discussion rather interested Krassotkin , and he stood still in the passage to listen . 
The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with even greater energy . 
`` I shall never , never believe , '' Nastya prattled , `` that the old women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen garden . 
It 's winter now and there are no cabbages , and so the old woman could n't have taken Katerina a daughter . '' 
Kolya whistled to himself . 
`` Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere , but only to those who are married . '' 
Kostya stared at Nastya and listened , pondering profoundly . 
`` Nastya , how silly you are ! '' 
he said at last , firmly and calmly . 
`` How can Katerina have a baby when she is n't married ? '' 
Nastya was exasperated . 
`` You know nothing about it , '' she snapped irritably . 
`` Perhaps she has a husband , only he is in prison , so now she 's got a baby . '' 
`` But is her husband in prison ? '' 
the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired gravely . 
`` Or , I tell you what , '' Nastya interrupted impulsively , completely rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis . 
`` She has n't a husband , you are right there , but she wants to be married , and so she 's been thinking of getting married , and thinking and thinking of it till now she 's got it , that is , not a husband but a baby . '' 
`` Well , perhaps so , '' Kostya agreed , entirely vanquished . 
`` But you did n't say so before . 
So how could I tell ? '' 
`` Come , kiddies , '' said Kolya , stepping into the room . 
`` You 're terrible people , I see . '' 
`` And Perezvon with you ! '' 
grinned Kostya , and began snapping his fingers and calling Perezvon . 
`` I am in a difficulty , kids , '' Krassotkin began solemnly , `` and you must help me . 
Agafya must have broken her leg , since she has not turned up till now , that 's certain . 
I must go out . 
Will you let me go ? '' 
The children looked anxiously at one another . 
Their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness , but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them . 
`` You wo n't be naughty while I am gone ? 
You wo n't climb on the cupboard and break your legs ? 
You wo n't be frightened alone and cry ? '' 
A look of profound despondency came into the children 's faces . 
`` And I could show you something as a reward , a little copper cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder . ''
