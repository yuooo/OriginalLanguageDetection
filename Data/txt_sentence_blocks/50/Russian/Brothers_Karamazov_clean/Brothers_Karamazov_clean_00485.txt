Smurov picked it up and carried it after him . 
All the boys were crying , and Kolya and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all . 
Though Smurov , with the captain 's hat in his hand , was crying bitterly too , he managed , as he ran , to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the path , to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by . 
He missed them , of course , and went on crying as he ran . 
Half-way , Snegiryov suddenly stopped , stood still for half a minute , as though struck by something , and suddenly turning back to the church , ran towards the deserted grave . 
But the boys instantly overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides . 
Then he fell helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down , and struggling , sobbing , and wailing , he began crying out , `` Ilusha , old man , dear old man ! '' 
Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him get up , soothing and persuading him . 
`` Captain , give over , a brave man must show fortitude , '' muttered Kolya . 
`` You 'll spoil the flowers , '' said Alyosha , and mamma is expecting them , she is sitting crying because you would not give her any before . 
Ilusha 's little bed is still there - '' `` Yes , yes , mamma ! '' 
Snegiryov suddenly recollected , `` they 'll take away the bed , they 'll take it away , '' he added as though alarmed that they really would . 
He jumped up and ran homewards again . 
But it was not far off and they all arrived together . 
Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarrelled just before : `` Mamma , poor crippled darling , Ilusha has sent you these flowers , '' he cried , holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow . 
But at that instant he saw in the corner , by the little bed , Ilusha 's little boots , which the landlady had put tidily side by side . 
Seeing the old , patched , rusty-looking , stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them , fell on his knees , snatched up one boot and , pressing his lips to it , began kissing it greedily , crying , `` Ilusha , old man , dear old man , where are your little feet ? '' 
`` Where have you taken him away ? 
Where have you taken him ? '' 
the lunatic cried in a heart-rending voice . 
Nina , too , broke into sobs . 
Kolya ran out of the room , the boys followed him . 
At last Alyosha too went out . 
`` Let them weep , '' he said to Kolya , `` it 's no use trying to comfort them just now . 
Let wait a minute and then go back . '' 
`` No , it 's no use , it 's awful , '' Kolya assented . 
`` Do you know , Karamazov , '' he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them , `` I feel dreadfully sad , and if it were only possible to bring him back , I 'd give anything in the world to do it . '' 
`` Ah , so would I , '' said Alyosha . 
`` What do you think , Karamazov ? 
Had we better come back here to-night ? 
He 'll be drunk , you know . '' 
`` Perhaps he will . 
Let us come together , you and I , that will be enough , to spend an hour with them , with the mother and Nina . 
If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again , '' Alyosha suggested . 
`` The landlady is laying the table for them now - there 'll be a funeral dinner or something , the priest is coming ; shall we go back to it , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Of course , '' said Alyosha . 
`` It 's all so strange , Karamazov , such sorrow and then pancakes after it , it all seems so unnatural in our religion . '' 
`` They are going to have salmon , too , '' the boy who had discovered about Troy observed in a loud voice . 
`` I beg you most earnestly , Kartashov , not to interrupt again with your idiotic remarks , especially when one is not talking to you and does n't care to know whether you exist or not ! '' 
Kolya snapped out irritably . 
The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply . 
Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov exclaimed : `` There 's Ilusha 's stone , under which they wanted to bury him . '' 
They all stood still by the big stone . 
Alyosha looked and the whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day , how Ilusha , weeping and hugging his father , had cried , `` Father , father , how he insulted you , '' rose at once before his imagination . 
A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul . 
With a serious and earnest expression he looked from one to another of the bright , pleasant faces of Ilusha 's schoolfellows , and suddenly said to them : `` Boys , I should like to say one word to you , here at this place . '' 
The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes upon him . 
`` Boys , we shall soon part . 
I shall be for some time with my two brothers , of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death 's door . 
But soon I shall leave this town , perhaps for a long time , so we shall part .
