How ? '' 
`` Yes , Lise , your question just now : whether we were n't showing contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul - that was the question of a sufferer ... . 
You see , I do n't know how to express it , but anyone who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering . 
Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many things already . '' 
`` Alyosha , give me your hand . 
Why are you taking it away ? '' 
murmured Lise in a failing voice , weak with happiness . 
`` Listen , Alyosha . 
What will you wear when you come out of the monastery ? 
What sort of suit ? 
Do n't laugh , do n't be angry , it 's very , very important to me . '' 
`` I have n't thought about the suit , Lise ; But I 'll wear whatever you like . '' 
`` I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat , a white pique waistcoat , and a soft grey felt hat ... . 
Tell me , did you believe that I did n't care for you when I said I did n't mean what I wrote ? '' 
`` No , I did n't believe it . '' 
`` Oh , you insupportable person , you are incorrigible . '' 
`` You see , I knew that you seemed to care for me , but I pretended to believe that you did n't care for me to make it easier for you . '' 
`` That makes it worse ! 
Worse and better than all ! 
Alyosha , I am awfully fond of you . 
Just before you came this morning , I tried my fortune . 
I decided I would ask you for my letter , and if you brought it out calmly and gave it to me -LRB- as might have been expected from you -RRB- it would mean that you did not love me at all , that you felt nothing , and were simply a stupid boy , good for nothing , and that I am ruined . 
But you left the letter at home and that cheered me . 
You left it behind on purpose , so as not to give it back , because you knew I would ask for it ? 
That was it , was n't it ? '' 
`` Ah , Lise , it was not so a bit . 
The letter is with me now , and it was this morning , in this pocket . 
Here it is . '' 
Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing , and showed it her at a distance . 
`` But I am not going to give it to you . 
Look at it from here . '' 
`` Why , then you told a lie ? 
You , a monk , told a lie ! '' 
`` I told a lie if you like , '' Alyosha laughed , too . 
`` I told a lie so as not to give you back the letter . 
It 's very precious to me , '' he added suddenly , with strong feeling , and again he flushed . 
`` It always will be , and I wo n't give it up to anyone ! '' 
Lise looked at him joyfully . 
`` Alyosha , '' she murmured again , `` look at the door . 
Is n't mamma listening ? '' 
`` Very well , Lise , I 'll look ; but would n't it be better not to look ? 
Why suspect your mother of such meanness ? '' 
`` What meanness ? 
As for her spying on her daughter , it 's her right , it 's not meanness ! '' 
cried Lise , firing up . 
`` You may be sure , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that when I am a mother , if I have a daughter like myself I shall certainly spy on her ! '' 
`` Really , Lise ? 
That 's not right . '' 
`` Oh , my goodness ! 
What has meanness to do with it ?
