Why are you so depressed , Alyosha ? 
Are you afraid of me ? '' 
She peeped into his eyes with merry mockery . 
`` He 's sad . 
The promotion has not been given , '' boomed Rakitin . 
`` His elder stinks . '' 
`` What ? 
You are talking some nonsense , you want to say something nasty . 
Be quiet , you stupid ! 
Let me sit on your knee , Alyosha , like this . '' 
She suddenly skipped forward and jumped , laughing , on his knee , like a nestling kitten , with her right arm about his neck . 
`` I 'll cheer you up , my pious boy . 
Yes , really , will you let me sit on your knee ? 
You wo n't be angry ? 
If you tell me , I 'll get off ? '' 
Alyosha did not speak . 
He sat afraid to move , he heard her words , `` If you tell me , I 'll get off , '' but he did not answer . 
But there was nothing in his heart such as Rakitin , for instance , watching him malignantly from his corner , might have expected or fancied . 
The great grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused , and , if only he could have thought clearly at that moment , he would have realised that he had now the strongest armour to protect him from every lust and temptation . 
Yet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and the sorrow that overwhelmed him , he could not help wondering at a new and strange sensation in his heart . 
This woman , this `` dreadful '' woman , had no terror for him now , none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at any passing thought of woman . 
On the contrary , this woman , dreaded above all women , sitting now on his knee , holding him in her arms , aroused in him now a quite different , unexpected , peculiar feeling , a feeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear , of his former terror . 
That was what instinctively surprised him . 
`` You 've talked nonsense enough , '' cried Rakitin , `` you 'd much better give us some champagne . 
You owe it me , you know you do ! '' 
`` Yes , I really do . 
Do you know , Alyosha , I promised him champagne on the top of everything , if he 'd bring you ? 
I 'll have some too ! 
Fenya , Fenya , bring us the bottle Mitya left ! 
Look sharp ! 
Though I am so stingy , I 'll stand a bottle , not for you , Rakitin , you 're a toadstool , but he is a falcon ! 
And though my heart is full of something very different , so be it , I 'll drink with you . 
I long for some dissipation . '' 
`` But what is the matter with you ? 
And what is this message , may I ask , or is it a secret ? '' 
Rakitin put in inquisitively , doing his best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him . 
`` Ech , it 's not a secret , and you know it , too , '' Grushenka said , in a voice suddenly anxious , turning her head towards Rakitin , and drawing a little away from Alyosha , though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his neck . 
`` My officer is coming , Rakitin , my officer is coming . '' 
`` I heard he was coming , but is he so near ? '' 
`` He is at Mokroe now ; he 'll send a messenger from there , so he wrote ; I got a letter from him to-day . 
I am expecting the messenger every minute . '' 
`` You do n't say so ! 
Why at Mokroe ? '' 
`` That 's a long story , I 've told you enough . '' 
`` Mitya 'll be up to something now - I say ! 
Does he know or does n't he ? '' 
`` He know ! 
Of course he does n't . 
If he knew , there would be murder . 
But I am not afraid of that now , I am not afraid of his knife .
