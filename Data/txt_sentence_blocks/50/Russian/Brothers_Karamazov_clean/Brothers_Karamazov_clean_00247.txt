`` That 's not what I mean . 
I 'm talking of a higher order . 
There 's no order in me , no higher order . 
But ... that 's all over . 
There 's no need to grieve about it . 
It 's too late , damn it ! 
My whole life has been disorder , and one must set it in order . 
Is that a pun , eh ? '' 
`` You 're raving , not making puns ! 
`` Glory be to God in Heaven , Glory be to God in me ... `` That verse came from my heart once , it 's not a verse , but a tear ... . 
I made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain 's beard , though ... '' `` Why do you bring him in all of a sudden ? '' 
`` Why do I bring him in ? 
Foolery ! 
All things come to an end ; all things are made equal . 
That 's the long and short of it . '' 
`` You know , I keep thinking of your pistols . '' 
`` That 's all foolery , too ! 
Drink , and do n't be fanciful . 
I love life . 
I 've loved life too much , shamefully much . 
Enough ! 
Let 's drink to life , dear boy , I propose the toast . 
Why am I pleased with myself ? 
I 'm a scoundrel , but I 'm satisfied with myself . 
And yet I 'm tortured by the thought that I 'm a scoundrel , but satisfied with myself . 
I bless the creation . 
I 'm ready to bless God and His creation directly , but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others ... . 
Let us drink to life , dear brother . 
What can be more precious than life ? 
Nothing ! 
To life , and to one queen of queens ! '' 
`` Let 's drink to life and to your queen , too , if you like . '' 
They drank a glass each . 
Although Mitya was excited and expansive , yet he was melancholy , too . 
It was as though some heavy , overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him . 
`` Misha ... here 's your Misha come ! 
Misha , come here , my boy , drink this glass to Phoebus the golden-haired , of to-morrow morn ... '' `` What are you giving it him for ? '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch , irritably . 
`` Yes , yes , yes , let me ! 
I want to ! '' 
`` E - ech ! '' 
Misha emptied the glass , bowed , and ran out . 
`` He 'll remember it afterwards , '' Mitya remarked . 
`` Woman , I love woman ! 
What is woman ? 
The queen of creation ! 
My heart is sad , my heart is sad , Pyotr Ilyitch . 
Do you remember Hamlet ? ' 
I am very sorry , good Horatio ! 
Alas , poor Yorick ! '
