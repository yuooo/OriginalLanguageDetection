He did not belong to anyone ! '' 
he explained , to the captain , to his wife , to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha . 
`` He used to live in the Fedotovs ' backyard . 
Though he made his home there , they did not feed him . 
He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I found him ... . 
You see , old man , he could n't have swallowed what you gave him . 
If he had , he must have died , he must have ! 
So he must have spat it out , since he is alive . 
You did not see him do it . 
But the pin pricked his tongue , that is why he squealed . 
He ran away squealing and you thought he 'd swallowed it . 
He might well squeal , because the skin of dogs ' mouths is so tender ... tenderer than in men , much tenderer ! '' 
Kolya cried impetuously , his face glowing and radiant with delight . 
Ilusha could not speak . 
White as a sheet , he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya , with his great eyes almost starting out of his head . 
And if Krassotkin , who had no suspicion of it , had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child 's health , nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him . 
But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realised it . 
As for the captain he behaved like a small child . 
`` Zhutchka ! 
It 's Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried in a blissful voice , `` Ilusha , this is Zhutchka , your Zhutchka ! 
Mamma , this is Zhutchka ! '' 
He was almost weeping . 
`` And I never guessed ! '' 
cried Smurov regretfully . 
`` Bravo , Krassotkin ! 
I said he 'd find the dog and here he 's found him . '' 
`` Here he 's found him ! '' 
another boy repeated gleefully . 
`` Krassotkin 's a brick ! 
cried a third voice . 
`` He 's a brick , he 's a brick ! '' 
cried the other boys , and they began clapping . 
`` Wait , wait , '' Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all . 
`` I 'll tell you how it happened , that 's the whole point . 
I found him , I took him home and hid him at once . 
I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to anyone till to-day . 
Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight , but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess . 
And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks . 
You should only see all the things he can do ! 
I trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog , in good condition , old man , so as to be able to say to you , ` See , old man , what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now ! ' 
Have n't you a bit of meat ? 
He 'll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing . 
A piece of meat , have n't you got any ? '' 
The captain ran across the passage to the landlady , where their cooking was done . 
Not to lose precious time , Kolya , in desperate haste , shouted to Perezvon , `` Dead ! '' 
And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air . 
The boys laughed , Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile , but the person most delighted with the dog 's performance was `` mamma . '' 
She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it , `` Perezvon , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Nothing will make him get up , nothing ! ''
