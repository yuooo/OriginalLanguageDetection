Miusov observed aloud , while Maximov ran back to the monastery . 
`` He 's like von Sohn , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly . 
`` Is that all you can think of ? 
... In what way is he like von Sohn ? 
Have you ever seen von Sohn ? '' 
`` I 've seen his portrait . 
It 's not the features , but something indefinable . 
He 's a second von Sohn . 
I can always tell from the physiognomy . '' 
`` Ah , I dare say you are a connoisseur in that . 
But , look here , Fyodor Pavlovitch , you said just now that we had given our word to behave properly . 
Remember it . 
I advise you to control yourself . 
But , if you begin to play the fool I do n't intend to be associated with you here ... You see what a man he is '' - he turned to the monk - `` I 'm afraid to go among decent people with him . '' 
A fine smile , not without a certain slyness , came on to the pale , bloodless lips of the monk , but he made no reply , and was evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity . 
Miusov frowned more than ever . 
`` Oh , devil take them all ! 
An outer show elaborated through centuries , and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath , '' flashed through Miusov 's mind . 
`` Here 's the hermitage . 
We 've arrived , '' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
`` The gates are shut . '' 
And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above and on the sides of the gates . 
`` When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do . 
Here in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved . 
They look at one another , and eat cabbages . 
And not one woman goes in at this gate . 
That 's what is remarkable . 
And that really is so . 
But I did hear that the elder receives ladies , '' he remarked suddenly to the monk . 
`` Women of the people are here too now , lying in the portico there waiting . 
But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the portico , but outside the precincts you can see the windows - and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough . 
They are always outside the precincts . 
There is a Harkov lady , Madame Hohlakov , waiting there now with her sick daughter . 
Probably he has promised to come out to her , though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even to the people . '' 
`` So then there are loopholes , after all , to creep out of the hermitage to the ladies . 
Do n't suppose , holy father , that I mean any harm . 
But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed , but no creature of the female sex - no hens , nor turkey hens , nor cows . '' 
`` Fyodor Pavlovitch , I warn you I shall go back and leave you here . 
They 'll turn you out when I 'm gone . '' 
`` But I 'm not interfering with you , Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
Look , '' he cried suddenly , stepping within the precincts , `` what a vale of roses they live in ! '' 
Though there were no roses now , there were numbers of rare and beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them , and evidently tended by a skilful hand ; there were flower-beds round the church , and between the tombs ; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers . 
`` And was it like this in the time of the last elder , Varsonofy ? 
He did n't care for such elegance . 
They say he used to jump up and thrash even ladies with a stick , '' observed Fyodor Pavlovitch , as he went up the steps . 
`` The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange , but a great deal that 's told is foolishness . 
He never thrashed anyone , '' answered the monk . 
`` Now , gentlemen , if you will wait a minute I will announce you . '' 
`` Fyodor Pavlovitch , for the last time , your compact , do you hear ? 
Behave properly or I will pay you out ! ''
