`` It 's easy enough to thrust them upon one . 
And who wrote them ? 
Can they have been written by men ? '' 
`` The Holy Spirit wrote them , '' said I. `` It 's easy for you to prate , '' he smiled again , this time almost with hatred . 
I took the book again , opened it in another place and showed him the Epistle to the Hebrews , chapter 10 , verse 31 . 
He read : `` It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . '' 
He read it and simply flung down the book . 
He was trembling all over . 
`` An awful text , '' he said . 
`` There 's no denying you 've picked out fitting ones . '' 
He rose from the chair . 
`` Well ! '' 
he said , `` good-bye , perhaps I sha n't come again ... we shall meet in heaven . 
So I have been for fourteen years ` in the hands of the living God , ' that 's how one must think of those fourteen years . 
To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go . '' 
I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him , but I did not dare - his face was contorted add sombre . 
He went away . 
`` Good God , '' I thought , `` what has he gone to face ! '' 
I fell on my knees before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God , our swift defender and helper . 
I was half an hour praying in tears , and it was late , about midnight . 
Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again . 
I was surprised . 
Where have you been ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` I think , '' he said , `` I 've forgotten something ... my handkerchief , I think ... . 
Well , even if I 've not forgotten anything , let me stay a little . '' 
He sat down . 
I stood over him . 
`` You sit down , too , '' said he . 
I sat down . 
We sat still for two minutes ; he looked intently at me and suddenly smiled . 
I remembered that - then he got up , embraced me warmly and kissed me . 
`` Remember , '' he said , `` how I came to you a second time . 
Do you hear , remember it ! '' 
And he went out . 
`` To-morrow , '' I thought . 
And so it was . 
I did not know that evening that the next day was his birthday . 
I had not been out for the last few days , so I had no chance of hearing it from anyone . 
On that day he always had a great gathering , everyone in the town went to it . 
It was the same this time . 
After dinner he walked into the middle of the room , with a paper in his hand - a formal declaration to the chief of his department who was present . 
This declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly . 
It contained a full account of the crime , in every detail . 
`` I cut myself off from men as a monster . 
God has visited me , '' he said in conclusion . 
`` I want to suffer for my sin ! '' 
Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been keeping for fourteen years , that he thought would prove his crime , the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert suspicion , a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her betrothed in the locket , her notebook and two letters ; one from her betrothed , telling her that he would soon be with her , and her unfinished answer left on the table to be sent off next day . 
He carried off these two letters - what for ? 
Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of destroying them as evidence against him ?
