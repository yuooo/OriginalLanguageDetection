It 's not he murdered father , not he ! '' 
Ivan suddenly stopped . 
`` Who is the murderer then , according to you ? '' 
he asked , with apparent coldness . 
There was even a supercilious note in his voice . 
`` You know who , '' Alyosha pronounced in a low , penetrating voice . 
`` Who ? 
You mean the myth about that crazy idiot , the epileptic , Smerdyakov ? '' 
Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over . 
`` You know who , '' broke helplessly from him . 
He could scarcely breathe . 
`` Who ? 
Who ? '' 
Ivan cried almost fiercely . 
All his restraint suddenly vanished . 
`` I only know one thing , '' Alyosha went on , still almost in a whisper , `` it was n't you killed father . '' '' 
` Not you ' ! 
What do you mean by ` not you ' ? '' 
Ivan was thunderstruck . 
`` It was not you killed father , not you ! 
Alyosha repeated firmly . 
The silence lasted for half a minute . 
`` I know I did n't . 
Are you raving ? '' 
said Ivan , with a pale , distorted smile . 
His eyes were riveted on Alyosha . 
They were standing again under a lamp-post . 
`` No , Ivan . 
You 've told yourself several times that you are the murderer . '' 
`` When did I say so ? 
I was in Moscow ... . 
When have I said so ? '' 
Ivan faltered helplessly . 
`` You 've said so to yourself many times , when you 've been alone during these two dreadful months , '' Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before . 
Yet he was speaking now , as it were , not of himself , not of his own will , but obeying some irresistible command . 
`` You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else . 
But you did n't do it : you are mistaken : you are not the murderer . 
Do you hear ? 
It was not you ! 
God has sent me to tell you so . '' 
They were both silent . 
The silence lasted a whole long minute . 
They were both standing still , gazing into each other 's eyes . 
They were both pale . 
Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over , and clutched Alyosha 's shoulder . 
`` You 've been in my room ! '' 
he whispered hoarsely . 
`` You 've been there at night , when he came ... . 
Confess ... have you seen him , have you seen him ? '' 
`` Whom do you mean - Mitya ? ''
