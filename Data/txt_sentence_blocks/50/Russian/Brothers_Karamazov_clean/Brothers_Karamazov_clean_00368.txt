`` Oh , yes . 
You wo n't forget , you wo n't forget what I asked you ? 
It 's a question of life and death ! 
`` Of course , I wo n't forget , if I can ... but I am so late , '' muttered Alyosha , beating a hasty retreat . 
`` No , be sure , be sure to come in ; do n't say ` If you can . ' 
I shall die if you do n't , '' Madame Hohlakov called after him , but Alyosha had already left the room . 
A Little Demon GOING in to Lise , he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair , in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk . 
She did not move to meet him , but her sharp , keen eyes were simply riveted on his face . 
There was a feverish look in her eyes , her face was pale and yellow . 
Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three days . 
She was positively thinner . 
She did not hold out her hand to him . 
He touched the thin , long fingers which lay motionless on her dress , then he sat down facing her , without a word . 
`` I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison , '' Lise said curtly , `` and mamma 's kept you there for hours ; she 's just been telling you about me and Yulia . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` I 've been listening . 
Why do you stare at me ? 
I want to listen and I do listen , there 's no harm in that . 
I do n't apologise . '' 
`` You are upset about something ? '' 
`` On the contrary , I am very happy . 
I 've only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your wife . 
You are not fit to be a husband . 
If I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after you , you 'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back , too . 
If you were forty , you would still go on taking my love-letters for me . '' 
She suddenly laughed . 
`` There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you , '' Alyosha smiled to her . 
`` The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you . 
What 's more , I do n't want to feel ashamed with you , just with you . 
Alyosha , why is it I do n't respect you ? 
I am very fond of you , but I do n't respect you . 
If I respected you , I should n't talk to you without shame , should I ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't believe it . '' 
Lise laughed nervously again ; she spoke rapidly . 
`` I sent your brother , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , some sweets in prison . 
Alyosha , you know , you are quite pretty ! 
I shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you . '' 
`` Why did you send for me to-day , Lise ? '' 
`` I wanted to tell you of a longing I have . 
I should like some one to torture me , marry me and then torture me , deceive me and go away . 
I do n't want to be happy . '' 
`` You are in love with disorder ? '' 
`` Yes , I want disorder . 
I keep wanting to set fire to the house . 
I keep imagining how I 'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly ; it must be on the sly . 
They 'll try to put it out , but it 'll go on burning . 
And I shall know and say nothing .
