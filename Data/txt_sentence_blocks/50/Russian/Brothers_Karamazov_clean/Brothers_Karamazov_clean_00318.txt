`` You can speak , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch assented . 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ! '' 
Mitya got up from his chair , `` have faith in God and in me . 
I am not guilty of my father 's murder ! '' 
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair . 
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon . 
`` Thanks be to Thee , O Lord , '' she said , in a voice thrilled with emotion , and still standing , she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added : `` As he has spoken now , believe it ! 
I know him . 
He 'll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy , but he 'll never deceive you against his conscience . 
He 's telling the whole truth , you may believe it . '' 
`` Thanks , Agrafena Alexandrovna , you 've given me fresh courage , '' Mitya responded in a quivering voice . 
As to the money spent the previous day , she declared that she did not know what sum it was , but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him . 
And to the question where he got the money , she said that he had told her that he had `` stolen '' it from Katerina Ivanovna , and that she had replied to that that he had n't stolen it , and that he must pay the money back next day . 
On the prosecutor 's asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday , or what he had squandered here a month ago , she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago , and that that was how she understood him . 
Grushenka was at last released , and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could be of any assistance to her , with horses for example , or if she would care for an escort , he ... would be - `` I thank you sincerely , '' said Grushenka , bowing to him , `` I 'm going with this old gentleman ; I am driving him back to town with me , and meanwhile , if you 'll allow me , I 'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
She went out . 
Mitya was calm , and even looked more cheerful , but only for a moment . 
He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness . 
His eyes were closing with fatigue . 
The examination of the witnesses was , at last , over . 
They procceded to a revision of the protocol . 
Mitya got up , moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain , lay down on a large chest covered with a rug , and instantly fell asleep . 
He had a strange dream , utterly out of keeping with the place and the time . 
He was driving somewhere in the steppes , where he had been stationed long ago , and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses , through snow and sleet . 
He was cold , it was early in November , and the snow was falling in big wet flakes , melting as soon as it touched the earth . 
And the peasant drove him smartly , he had a fair , long beard . 
He was not an old man , somewhere about fifty , and he had on a grey peasant 's smock . 
Not far off was a village , he could see the black huts , and half the huts were burnt down , there were only the charred beams sticking up . 
And as they drove in , there were peasant women drawn up along the road , a lot of women , a whole row , all thin and wan , with their faces a sort of brownish colour , especially one at the edge , a tall , bony woman , who looked forty , but might have been only twenty , with a long thin face . 
And in her arms was a little baby crying . 
And her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them . 
And the child cried and cried , and held out its little bare arms , with its little fists blue from cold . 
`` Why are they crying ? 
Why are they crying ? '' 
Mitya asked , as they dashed gaily by . 
`` It 's the babe , '' answered the driver , `` the babe weeping . '' 
And Mitya was struck by his saying , in his peasant way , `` the babe , '' and he liked the peasant 's calling it a `` babe . '' 
There seemed more pity in it . 
`` But why is it weeping ? '' 
Mitya persisted stupidly , `` why are its little arms bare ? 
Why do n't they wrap it up ? '' 
`` The babe 's cold , its little clothes are frozen and do n't warm it . '' 
`` But why is it ? 
Why ? '' 
foolish Mitya still persisted . 
`` Why , they 're poor people , burnt out . 
They 've no bread . 
They 're begging because they 've been burnt out . '' 
`` No , no , '' Mitya , as it were , still did not understand . 
`` Tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there ?
