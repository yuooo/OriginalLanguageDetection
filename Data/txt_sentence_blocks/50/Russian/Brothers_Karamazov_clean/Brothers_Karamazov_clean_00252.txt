I did n't ask particularly . 
They 've set to playing cards , so Timofey said . '' 
`` Cards ? '' 
`` So , maybe they 're not in bed if they 're at cards . 
It 's most likely not more than eleven . '' 
`` Quicker , Andrey ! 
Quicker ! '' 
Mitya cried again , nervously . 
`` May I ask you something , sir ? '' 
said Andrey , after a pause . 
`` Only I 'm afraid of angering you , sir . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Why , Fenya threw herself at your feet just now , and begged you not to harm her mistress , and someone else , too ... so you see , sir - It 's I am taking you there ... forgive me , sir , it 's my conscience ... maybe it 's stupid of me to speak of it - . '' 
Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind . 
`` Are you a driver ? '' 
he asked frantically . 
`` Yes sir . '' 
`` Then you know that one has to make way . 
What would you say to a driver who would n't make way for anyone , but would just drive on and crush people ? 
No , a driver must n't run over people . 
One ca n't run over a man . 
One ca n't spoil people 's lives . 
And if you have spoilt a life - punish yourself ... . 
If only you 've spoilt , if only you 've ruined anyone 's life - punish yourself and go away . '' 
These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically . 
Though Andrey was surprised at him , he kept up the conversation . 
`` That 's right , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you 're quite right , one must n't crush or torment a man , or any kind of creature , for every creature is created by God . 
Take a horse , for instance , for some folks , even among us drivers , drive anyhow . 
Nothing will restrain them , they just force it along . '' 
`` To hell ? '' 
Mitya interrupted , and went off into his abrupt , short laugh . 
`` Andrey , simple soul , '' he seized him by the shoulders again , `` tell me , will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell , or not , what do you think ? '' 
`` I do n't know , darling , it depends on you , for you are ... you see , sir , when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died , He went straight down to hell from the Cross , and set free all sinners that were in agony . 
And the devil groaned , because he thought that he would get no more sinners in hell . 
And God said to him , then , ` Do n't groan , for you shall have all the mighty of the earth , the rulers , the chief judges , and the rich men , and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I come again . ' 
Those were His very words ... '' `` A peasant legend ! 
Capital ! 
Whip up the left , Andrey ! '' 
`` So you see , sir , who it is hell 's for , '' said Andrey , whipping up the left horse , `` but you 're like a little child ... that 's how we look on you ... and though you 're hasty-tempered , sir , yet God will forgive you for your kind heart . '' 
`` And you , do you forgive me , Andrey ? '' 
`` What should I forgive you for , sir ? 
You 've never done me any harm . '' 
`` No , for everyone , for everyone , you here alone , on the road , will you forgive me for everyone ? 
Speak , simple peasant heart ! '' 
`` Oh , sir ! 
I feel afraid of driving you , your talk is so strange . '' 
But Mitya did not hear . 
He was frantically praying and muttering to himself . 
`` Lord , receive me , with all my lawlessness , and do not condemn me . 
Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me , for I have condemned myself , do not condemn me , for I love Thee , O Lord .
