Who helped you to sew it up a month ago ? '' 
`` No one helped me . 
I did it myself . '' 
`` Can you sew ? '' 
`` A soldier has to know how to sew . 
No knowledge was needed to do that . '' 
`` Where did you get the material , that is , the rag in which you sewed the money ? '' 
`` Are you laughing at me ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
And we are in no mood for laughing , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` I do n't know where I got the rag from - somewhere , I suppose . '' 
`` I should have thought you could n't have forgotten it ? '' 
`` Upon my word , I do n't remember . 
I might have torn a bit off my linen . '' 
`` That 's very interesting . 
We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag . 
What sort of rag was it , cloth or linen ? '' 
`` Goodness only knows what it was . 
Wait a bit ... I believe I did n't tear it off anything . 
It was a bit of calico ... . 
I believe I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady 's . '' 
`` In your landlady 's cap ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I took it from her . '' 
`` How did you get it ? '' 
`` You see , I remember once taking a cap for a rag , perhaps to wipe my pen on . 
I took it without asking , because it was a worthless rag . 
I tore it up , and I took the notes and sewed them up in it . 
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them . 
An old piece of calico , washed a thousand times . '' 
`` And you remember that for certain now ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether for certain . 
I think it was in the cap . 
But , hang it , what does it matter ? '' 
`` In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost ? '' 
`` No , she wo n't , she did n't miss it . 
It was an old rag , I tell you , an old rag not worth a farthing . '' 
`` And where did you get the needle and thread ? '' 
`` I 'll stop now . 
I wo n't say any more . 
Enough of it ! '' 
said Mitya , losing his temper at last . 
`` It 's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place . '' 
`` Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow , and perhaps you 'll find it , '' said Mitya sneering . 
`` Enough , gentlemen , enough ! '' 
he decided , in an exhausted voice . 
`` I see you do n't believe me ! 
Not for a moment ! 
It 's my fault , not yours . 
I ought not to have been so ready .
