`` I wo n't tire you much . '' 
`` Certainly I can , '' mumbled Smerdyakov , in a faint voice . 
`` Has your honour been back long ? '' 
he added patronisingly , as though encouraging a nervous visitor . 
`` I only arrived to-day ... . 
To see the mess you are in here . '' 
Smerdyakov sighed . 
`` Why do you sigh ? 
You knew of it all along , '' Ivan blurted out . 
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while . 
`` How could I help knowing ? 
It was clear beforehand . 
But how could I tell it would turn out like that ? '' 
`` What would turn out ? 
Do n't prevaricate ! 
You 've foretold you 'd have a fit ; on the way down to the cellar , you know . 
You mentioned the very spot . '' 
`` Have you said so at the examination yet ? '' 
Smerdyakov queried with composure . 
Ivan felt suddenly angry . 
`` No , I have n't yet , but I certainly shall . 
You must explain a great deal to me , my man ; and let me tell you , I am not going to let you play with me ! '' 
`` Why should I play with you , when I put my whole trust in you , as in God Almighty ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with the same composure , only for a moment closing his eyes . 
`` In the first place , '' began Ivan , `` I know that epileptic fits ca n't be told beforehand . 
I 've inquired ; do n't try and take me in . 
You ca n't foretell the day and the hour . 
How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand , and about the cellar , too ? 
How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit , if you did n't sham a fit on purpose ? '' 
`` I had to go to the cellar anyway , several times a day , indeed , '' Smerdyakov drawled deliberately . 
`` I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago . 
It 's quite true you ca n't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand , but you can always have a presentiment of it . '' 
`` But you did foretell the day and the hour ! '' 
`` In regard to my epilepsy , sir , you had much better inquire of the doctors here . 
You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham ; it 's no use my saying any more about it . '' 
`` And the cellar ? 
How could you know beforehand of the cellar ? '' 
`` You do n't seem able to get over that cellar ! 
As I was going down to the cellar , I was in terrible dread and doubt . 
What frightened me most was losing you and being left without defence in all the world . 
So I went down into the cellar thinking , ` Here , it 'll come on directly , it 'll strike me down directly , shall I fall ? ' 
And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying . 
All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before , when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar , I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch , the investigating lawyer , and it 's all been written down in the protocol . 
And the doctor here , Mr. Varvinsky , maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on , the apprehension that I might fall . 
It was just then that the fit seized me . 
And so they 've written it down , that it 's just how it must have happened , simply from my fear . '' 
As he finished , Smerdyakov . 
drew a deep breath , as though exhausted . 
`` Then you have said all that in your evidence ? '' 
said Ivan , somewhat taken aback .
