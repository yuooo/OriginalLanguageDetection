Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself , yet there was something in his voice , determined and emphatic , resentful and insolently defiant . 
He stared impudently at Ivan . 
A mist passed before Ivan 's eyes for the first moment . 
`` How ? 
What ? 
Are you out of your mind ? '' 
`` I 'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties . '' 
`` Do you suppose I knew of the murder ? '' 
Ivan cried at last , and he brought his fist violently on the table . 
`` What do you mean by ` something else , too ' ? 
Speak , scoundrel ! '' 
Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare . 
`` Speak , you stinking rogue , what is that ` something else , too ' ? '' 
`` The ` something else ' I meant was that you probably , too , were very desirous of your parent 's death . '' 
Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder , so that he fell back against the wall . 
In an instant his face was bathed in tears . 
Saying , `` It 's a shame , sir , to strike a sick man , '' he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping . 
A minute passed . 
`` That 's enough ! 
Leave off , '' Ivan said peremptorily , sitting down again . 
`` Do n't put me out of all patience . '' 
Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes . 
Every line of his puckered face reflected the insult he had just received . 
`` So you thought then , you scoundrel , that together with Dmitri I meant to kill my father ? '' 
`` I did n't know what thoughts were in your mind then , '' said Smerdyakov resentfully ; `` and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that very point . '' 
`` To sound what , what ? '' 
`` Why , that very circumstance , whether you wanted your father to be murdered or not . '' 
What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive , insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered . 
`` It was you murdered him ? '' 
he cried suddenly . 
Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously . 
`` You know of yourself , for a fact , that it was n't I murdered him . 
And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again . '' 
`` But why , why had you such a suspicion about me at the time ? '' 
`` As you know already , it was simply from fear . 
For I was in such a position , shaking with fear , that I suspected everyone . 
I resolved to sound you , too , for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother , then the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly , too . '' 
`` Look here , you did n't say that a fortnight ago . '' 
`` I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital , only I thought you 'd understand without wasting words , and that being such a sensible man you would n't care to talk of it openly . '' 
`` What next ! 
Come answer , answer , I insist : what was it ... what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul ? '' 
`` As for the murder , you could n't have done that and did n't want to , but as for wanting someone else to do it , that was just what you did want . '' 
`` And how coolly , how coolly he speakst But why should I have wanted it ; what grounds had I for wanting it ? '' 
`` What grounds had you ? 
What about the inheritance ? '' 
said Smerdyakov sarcastically , and , as it were , vindictively . 
`` Why , after your parent 's death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you , and very likely more , but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady , Agrafena Alexandrovna , she would have had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding , for she 's plenty of sense , so that your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three of you . 
And were they far from a wedding , either ? 
Not a hair 's - breadth : that lady had only to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church , with his tongue out . '' 
Ivan restrained himself with painful effort .
