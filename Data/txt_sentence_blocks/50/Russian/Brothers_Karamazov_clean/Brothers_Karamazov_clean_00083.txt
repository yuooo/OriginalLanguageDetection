He seemed frantic . 
`` But you 've seen for yourself that she has n't come , '' cried Ivan . 
`` But she may have come by that other entrance . '' 
`` You know that entrance is locked , and you have the key . '' 
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room . 
He had , of course , found the other entrance locked , and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's pocket . 
The windows of all rooms were also closed , so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch , as soon as he saw him again . 
`` He 's been stealing money in my bedroom . '' 
And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri . 
But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples , tugged at them , and flung him with a crash on the floor . 
He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face . 
The old man moaned shrilly . 
Ivan , though not so strong as Dmitri , threw his arms round him , and with all his might pulled him away . 
Alyosha helped him with his slender strength , holding Dmitri in front . 
`` Madman ! 
You 've killed him ! '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Serve him right ! '' 
shouted Dmitri breathlessly . 
`` If I have n't killed him , I 'll come again and kill him . 
You ca n't protect him ! '' 
`` Dmitri ! 
Go away at once ! '' 
cried Alyosha commandingly . 
`` Alexey ! 
You tell me . 
It 's only you I can believe ; was she here just now , or not ? 
I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane . 
I shouted , she ran away . '' 
`` I swear she 's not been here , and no one expected her . '' 
`` But I saw her ... . 
So she must ... I 'll find out at once where she is ... . 
Good-bye , Alexey ! 
Not a word to Aesop about the money now . 
But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say , ` He sends his compliments to you ! ' 
Compliments , his compliments ! 
just compliments and farewell ! 
Describe the scene to her . '' 
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an arm-chair . 
His face was covered with blood , but he was conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri 's cries . 
He was still fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house . 
Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he went out . 
`` I do n't repent shedding your blood ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Beware , old man , beware of your dream , for I have my dream , too . 
I curse you , and disown you altogether . '' 
He ran out of the room . 
`` She 's here .
