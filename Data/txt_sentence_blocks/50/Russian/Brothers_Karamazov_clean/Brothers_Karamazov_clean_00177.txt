My mother began weeping , and , careful not to alarm my brother , she entreated him to go to church , to confess and take the sacrament , as he was still able to move about . 
This made him angry , and he said something profane about the church . 
He grew thoughtful , however ; he guessed at once that he was seriously ill , and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament . 
He had been aware , indeed , for a long time past , that he was far from well , and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to your mother and me , `` My life wo n't be long among you , I may not live another year , '' which seemed now like a prophecy . 
Three days passed and Holy Week had come . 
And on Tuesday morning my brother began going to church . 
`` I am doing this simply for your sake , mother , to please and comfort you , '' he said . 
My mother wept with joy and grief . 
`` His end must be near , '' she thought , `` if there 's such a change in him . '' 
But he was not able to go to church long , he took to his bed , so he had to confess and take the sacrament at home . 
It was a late Easter , and the days were bright , fine , and full of fragrance . 
I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly , but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair . 
That 's how I remember him sitting , sweet and gentle , smiling , his face bright and joyous , in spite of his illness . 
A marvellous change passed over him , his spirit seemed transformed . 
The old nurse would come in and say , `` Let me light the lamp before the holy image , my dear . '' 
And once he would not have allowed it and would have blown it out . 
`` Light it , light it , dear , I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it . 
You are praying when you light the lamp , and I am praying when I rejoice seeing you . 
So we are praying to the same God . '' 
Those words seemed strange to us , and mother would go to her room and weep , but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful . 
`` Mother , do n't weep , darling , '' he would say , `` I 've long to live yet , long to rejoice with you , and life is glad and joyful . '' 
`` Ah , dear boy , how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night , coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces . '' 
`` Do n't cry , mother , '' he would answer , `` life is paradise , and we are all in paradise , but we wo n't see it ; if we would , we should have heaven on earth the next day . '' 
Everyone wondered at his words , he spoke so strangely and positively ; we were all touched and wept . 
Friends came to see us . 
`` Dear ones , '' he would say to them , `` what have I done that you should love me so , how can you love anyone like me , and how was it I did not know , I did not appreciate it before ? '' 
When the servants came in to him he would say continually , `` Dear , kind people , why are you doing so much for me , do I deserve to be waited on ? 
If it were God 's will for me to live , I would wait on you , for all men should wait on one another . '' 
Mother shook her head as she listened . 
`` My darling , it 's your illness makes you talk like that . '' 
`` Mother darling , '' he would say , `` there must be servants and masters , but if so I will be the servant of my servants , the same as they are to me . 
And another thing , mother , every one of us has sinned against all men , and I more than any . '' 
Mother positively smiled at that , smiled through her tears . 
`` Why , how could you have sinned against all men , more than all ? 
Robbers and murderers have done that , but what sin have you committed yet , that you hold yourself more guilty than all ? '' 
`` Mother , little heart of mine , '' he said -LRB- he had begun using such strange caressing words at that time -RRB- , `` little heart of mine , my joy , believe me , everyone is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything . 
I do n't know how to explain it to you , but I feel it is so , painfully even . 
And how is it we went on then living , getting angry and not knowing ? '' 
So he would get up every day , more and more sweet and joyous and full of love . 
When the doctor , an old German called Eisenschmidt , came : `` Well , doctor , have I another day in this world ? '' 
he would ask , joking . 
`` You 'll live many days yet , '' the doctor would answer , `` and months and years too . '' 
`` Months and years ! '' 
he would exclaim . 
`` Why reckon the days ? 
One day is enough for a man to know all happiness . 
My dear ones , why do we quarrel , try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other ? 
Let 's go straight into the garden , walk and play there , love , appreciate , and kiss each other , and glorify life . '' 
`` Your son can not last long , '' the doctor told my mother , as she accompanied him the door . 
`` The disease is affecting his brain . ''
