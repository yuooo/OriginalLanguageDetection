`` I 'll bring everything in a minute , Lise , only do n't scream and do n't fuss . 
You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it . 
Where did you get such a dreadful wound , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Madame Hohlakov hastened away . 
This was all Lise was waiting for . 
`` First of all , answer the question , where did you get hurt like this ? '' 
she asked Alyosha , quickly . 
`` And then I 'll talk to you about something quite different . 
Well ? '' 
Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother 's absence was precious for her , Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the school boys in the fewest words possible . 
Lise clasped her hands at his story . 
`` How can you , and in that dress too , associate with schoolboys ? '' 
she cried angrily , as though she had a right to control him . 
`` You are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that , a perfect boy ! 
But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it , for there 's some mystery in it . 
Now for the second thing , but first a question : does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things , but talking sensibly ? '' 
`` Of course not , and I do n't feel much pain now . '' 
`` That 's because your finger is in the water . 
It must be changed directly , for it will get warm in a minute . 
Yulia , bring some ice from the cellar and another basin of water . 
Now she is gone , I can speak ; will you give me the letter I sent you yesterday , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch - be quick , for mamma will be back in a minute and I do n't want - '' `` I have n't got the letter . '' 
`` That 's not true , you have . 
I knew you would say that . 
You 've got it in that pocket . 
I 've been regretting that joke all night . 
Give me back the letter at once , give it me . '' 
`` I 've left it at home . '' 
`` But you ca n't consider me as a child , a little girl , after that silly joke ! 
I beg your pardon for that silliness , but you must bring me the letter , if you really have n't got it - bring to-day , you must , you must . '' 
`` To-day I ca n't possibly , for I am going back to the monastery and I sha n't come and see you for the next two days - three or four perhaps - for Father Zossima - '' `` Four days , what nonsense ! 
Listen . 
Did you laugh at me very much ? '' 
`` I did n't laugh at all . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Because I believed all you said . '' 
`` You are insulting me ! '' 
`` Not at all . 
As soon as I read it , I thought that all that would come to pass , for as soon as Father Zossima dies , I am to leave the monastery . 
Then I shall go back and finish my studies , and when you reach the legal age we will be married . 
I shall love you . 
Though I have n't had time to think about it , I believe I could n't find a better wife than you , and Father Zossima tells me I must marry . '' 
`` But I am a cripple , wheeled about in a chair , '' laughed Lise , flushing crimson . 
`` I 'll wheel you about myself , but I 'm sure you 'll get well by then . '' 
`` But you are mad , '' said Lise , nervously , `` to make all this nonsense out of a joke ! 
Here 's mamma , very a propos , perhaps . 
Mamma , how slow you always are , how can you be so long ! 
And here 's Yulia with the ice ! 
`` Oh , Lise , do n't scream , above all things do n't scream . 
That scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place ? 
I 've been hunting and hunting - I do believe you did it on purpose . ''
