Then he took the bullet and , before inserting it , held it in two fingers in front of the candle . 
`` Why are you looking at the bullet ? '' 
asked Pyotr Ilyitch , watching him with uneasy curiosity . 
`` Oh , a fancy . 
Why , if you meant to put that bullet in your brain , would you look at it or not ? '' 
`` Why look at it ? '' 
`` It 's going into my brain , so it 's interesting to look and see what it 's like . 
But that 's foolishness , a moment 's foolishness . 
Now that 's done , '' he added , putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod . 
`` Pyotr Ilyitch , my dear fellow , that 's nonsense , all nonsense , and if only you knew what nonsense ! 
Give me a little piece of paper now . '' 
`` Here 's some paper . '' 
`` No , a clean new piece , writing-paper . 
That 's right . '' 
And taking a pen from the table , Mitya rapidly wrote two lines , folded the paper in four , and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket . 
He put the pistols in the case , locked it up , and kept it in his hand . 
Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow , thoughtful smile . 
`` Now , let 's go . '' 
`` Where are we going ? 
No , wait a minute ... . 
Are you thinking of putting that bullet in your brain , perhaps ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily . 
`` I was fooling about the bullet ! 
I want to live . 
I love life , You may be sure of that . 
I love golden-haired Phorbus and his warm light ... . 
Dear Pyotr Ilyitch , do you know how to step aside ? '' 
`` What do you mean by ` stepping aside ' ? '' 
`` Making way . 
Making way for a dear creature , and for one I hate . 
And to let the one I hate become dear - that 's what making way means ! 
And to say to them : God bless you , go your way , pass on , while I - '' `` While you - ? '' 
`` That 's enough , let 's go . '' 
`` Upon my word . 
I 'll tell someone to prevent your going there , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , looking at him . 
`` What are you going to Mokroe for , now ? '' 
`` There 's a woman there , a woman . 
That 's enough for you . 
You shut up . '' 
`` Listen , though you 're such a savage I 've always liked you ... . 
I feel anxious . '' 
`` Thanks , old fellow . 
I 'm a savage you say . 
Savages , savages ! 
That 's what I am always saying . 
Savages ! 
Why , here 's Misha ! 
I was forgetting him . '' 
Misha ran in , post-haste , with a handful of notes in change , and reported that everyone was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs ' ; `` They 're carrying down the bottles , and the fish , and the tea ; it will all be ready directly . '' 
Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch , then tossed another ten-rouble note to Misha .
