Such distrustfulness in Mitya , such lack of confidence even to him , to Alyosha - all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother . 
Intense , infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly . 
There was a poignant ache in his torn heart . 
`` Love Ivan '' - he suddenly recalled Mitya 's words . 
And he was going to Ivan . 
He badly wanted to see Ivan all day . 
He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya , and more than ever now . 
Not You , Not You ! 
ON the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living . 
There was light in the windows . 
He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in . 
He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week . 
But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her , especially on the eve of the terrible day . 
Ringing , and mounting the staircase , which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern , he saw a man coming down , and as they met , he recognised him as his brother . 
So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Ah , it 's only you , '' said Ivan dryly . 
`` Well , good-bye ! 
You are going to her ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I do n't advise you to ; she 's upset and you 'll upset her more . '' 
A door was instantly flung open above , and a voice cried suddenly : `` No , no ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , have you come from him ? '' 
`` Yes , I have been with him . '' 
`` Has he sent me any message ? 
Come up , Alyosha , and you , Ivan Fyodorovitch , you must come back , you must . 
Do you hear ? '' 
There was such a peremptory note in Katya 's voice that Ivan , after a moment 's hesitation , made up his mind to go back with Alyosha . 
`` She was listening , '' he murmured angrily to himself , but Alyosha heard it . 
`` Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on , '' said Ivan , going into the drawing-room . 
`` I wo n't sit down . 
I wo n't stay more than a minute . '' 
`` Sit down , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' said Katerina Ivanovna , though she remained standing . 
She had changed very little during this time , but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes . 
Alyosha remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment . 
`` What did he ask you to tell me ? '' 
`` Only one thing , '' said Alyosha , looking her straight in the face , `` that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what '' -LRB- he was a little confused -RRB- '' ... passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that I bowed down to the ground for that money ! '' 
She broke into a bitter laugh . 
`` Why , is he afraid for me or for himself ? 
He asks me to spare - whom ? 
Him or myself ? 
Tell me , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! '' 
Alyosha watched her intently , trying to understand her . 
`` Both yourself and him , '' he answered softly . 
`` I am glad to hear it , '' she snapped out maliciously , and she suddenly blushed . 
`` You do n't know me yet , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said menacingly . 
`` And I do n't know myself yet . 
Perhaps you 'll want to trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow . '' 
`` You will give your evidence honourably , '' said Alyosha ; `` that 's all that 's wanted . ''
