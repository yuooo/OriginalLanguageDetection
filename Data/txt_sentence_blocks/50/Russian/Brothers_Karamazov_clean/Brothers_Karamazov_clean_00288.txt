`` Did I exclaim that ? 
Ach , that may be so , gentlemen ! 
Yes , unhappily , I did want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily , unhappily ! '' 
`` You wanted to . 
Would you consent to explain what motives precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent ? '' 
`` What is there to explain , gentlemen ? '' 
Mitya shrugged his shoulders sullenly , looking down . 
`` I have never concealed my feelings . 
All the town knows about it - everyone knows in the tavern . 
Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima 's cell . 
And the very same day , in the evening I beat my father . 
I nearly killed him , and I swore I 'd come again and kill him , before witnesses ... . 
Oh , a thousand witnesses ! 
I 've been shouting it aloud for the last month , anyone can tell you that ! 
... The fact stares you in the face , it speaks for itself , it cries aloud , but feelings , gentlemen , feelings are another matter . 
You see , gentlemen '' - Mitya frowned - `` it seemed to me that about feelings you 've no right to question me . 
I know that you are bound by your office , I quite understand that , but that 's my affair , my private , intimate affair , yet ... since I have n't concealed my feelings in the past ... in the tavern , for instance , I 've talked to everyone , so ... so I wo n't make a secret of it now . 
You see , I understand , gentlemen , that there are terrible facts against me in this business . 
I told everyone that I 'd kill him , and now , all of a sudden , he 's been killed . 
So it must have been me ! 
Ha ha ! 
I can make allowances for you , gentlemen , I can quite make allowances . 
I 'm struck all of a heap myself , for who can have murdered him , if not I ? 
That 's what it comes to , is n't it ? 
If not I , who can it be , who ? 
Gentlemen , I want to know , I insist on knowing ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly . 
`` Where was he murdered ? 
How was he murdered ? 
How , and with what ? 
Tell me , '' he asked quickly , looking at the two lawyers . 
`` We found him in his study , lying on his back on the floor , with his head battered in , '' said the prosecutor . 
`` That 's horrible ! '' 
Mitya shuddered and , putting his elbows on the table , hid his face in his right hand . 
`` We will continue , '' interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` So what was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred ? 
You have asserted in public , I believe , that it was based upon jealousy ? '' 
`` Well , yes , jealousy . 
not only jealousy . '' 
`` Disputes about money ? '' 
`` Yes , about money , too . '' 
`` There was a dispute about three thousand roubles , I think , which you claimed as part of your inheritance ? '' 
`` Three thousand ! 
More , more , '' cried Mitya hotly ; `` more than six thousand , more than ten , perhaps . 
I told everyone so , shouted it at them . 
But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand . 
I was desperately in need of that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes for three thousand that I knew he kept under his pillow , ready for Grushenka , I considered as simply stolen from me . 
Yes , gentlemen , I looked upon it as mine , as my own property ... '' The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer , and had time to wink at him on the sly . 
`` We will return to that subject later , '' said the lawyer promptly . 
`` You will allow us to note that point and write it down ; that you looked upon that money as your own property ? ''
