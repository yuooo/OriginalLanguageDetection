`` I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall . '' 
On Alyosha 's inquiring whether she had informed the police , she answered that she had told no one , `` but I flew straight to you , I 've run all the way . '' 
She seemed perfectly crazy , Alyosha reported , and was shaking like a leaf . 
When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage , he found Smerdyakov still hanging . 
On the table lay a note : `` I destroy my life of my own will and desire , so as to throw no blame on anyone . '' 
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told him all about it . 
`` And from him I 've come straight to you , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , looking intently into Ivan 's face . 
He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story , as though struck by something in his expression . 
`` Brother , '' he cried suddenly , `` you must be terribly ill . 
You look and do n't seem to understand what I tell you . '' 
`` It 's a good thing you came , '' said Ivan , as though brooding , and not hearing Alyosha 's exclamation . 
`` I knew he had hanged himself . '' 
`` From whom ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
But I knew . 
Did I know ? 
Yes , he told me . 
He told me so just now . '' 
Ivan stood in the middle of the room , and still spoke in the same brooding tone , looking at the ground . 
`` Who is he ? '' 
asked Alyosha , involuntarily looking round . 
`` He 's slipped away . '' 
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly . 
`` He was afraid of you , of a dove like you . 
You are a ` pure cherub . ' 
Dmitri calls you a cherub . 
Cherub ! 
... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim . 
What are seraphim ? 
Perhaps a whole constellation . 
But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule . 
There 's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun . 
Do n't you know it ? '' 
`` Brother , sit down , '' said Alyosha in alarm . 
`` For goodness ' sake , sit down on the sofa ! 
You are delirious ; put your head on the pillow , that 's right . 
Would you like a wet towel on your head ? 
Perhaps it will do you good . '' 
`` Give me the towel : it 's here on the chair . 
I just threw it down there . '' 
`` It 's not here . 
Do n't worry yourself . 
I know where it is - here , '' said Alyosha , finding a clean towel , folded up and unused , by Ivan 's dressing-table in the other corner of the room . 
Ivan looked strangely at the towel : recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant . 
`` Stay '' - he got up from the sofa - `` an hour ago I took that new towel from there and wetted it . 
I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ... How is it it 's dry ? 
There was no other . '' 
`` You put that towel on your head ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles burnt down so ?
