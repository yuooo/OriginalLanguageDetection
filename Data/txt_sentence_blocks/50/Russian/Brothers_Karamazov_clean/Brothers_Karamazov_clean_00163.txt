`` And the old man ? '' 
`` The kiss glows in his heart , but the old man adheres to his idea . '' 
`` And you with him , you too ? '' 
cried Alyosha , mournfully . 
Ivan laughed . 
`` Why , it 's all nonsense , Alyosha . 
It 's only a senseless poem of a senseless student , who could never write two lines of verse . 
Why do you take it so seriously ? 
Surely you do n't suppose I am going straight off to the Jesuits , to join the men who are correcting His work ? 
Good Lord , it 's no business of mine . 
I told you , all I want is to live on to thirty , and then ... dash the cup to the ground ! '' 
`` But the little sticky leaves , and the precious tombs , and the blue sky , and the woman you love ! 
How will you live , how will you love them ? '' 
Alyosha cried sorrowfully . 
`` With such a hell in your heart and your head , how can you ? 
No , that 's just what you are going away for , to join them ... if not , you will kill yourself , you ca n't endure it ! '' 
`` There is a strength to endure everything , '' Ivan said with a cold smile . 
`` The strength of the Karamazovs - the strength of the Karamazov baseness . '' 
`` To sink into debauchery , to stifle your soul with corruption , yes ? '' 
`` Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it , and then - '' `` How will you escape it ? 
By what will you escape it ? 
That 's impossible with your ideas . '' 
`` In the Karamazov way , again . '' '' 
` Everything is lawful , ' you mean ? 
Everything is lawful , is that it ? '' 
Ivan scowled , and all at once turned strangely pale . 
`` Ah , you 've caught up yesterday 's phrase , which so offended Muisov - and which Dmitri pounced upon so naively and paraphrased ! '' 
he smiled queerly . 
`` Yes , if you like , ` everything is lawful ' since the word has been said , I wo n't deny it . 
And Mitya 's version is n't bad . '' 
Alyosha looked at him in silence . 
`` I thought that going away from here I have you at least , '' Ivan said suddenly , with unexpected feeling ; `` but now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart , my dear hermit . 
The formula , ` all is lawful , ' I wo n't renounce - will you renounce me for that , yes ? '' 
Alyosha got up , went to him and softly kissed him on the lips . 
`` That 's plagiarism , '' cried Ivan , highly delighted . 
`` You stole that from my poem . 
Thank you though . 
Get up , Alyosha , it 's time we were going , both of us . '' 
They went out , but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant . 
`` Listen , Alyosha , '' Ivan began in a resolute voice , `` if I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them , remembering you . 
It 's enough for me that you are somewhere here , and I sha n't lose my desire for life yet . 
Is that enough for you ? 
Take it as a declaration of love if you like . 
And now you go to the right and I to the left . 
And it 's enough , do you hear , enough . 
I mean even if I do n't go away to-morrow -LRB- I think I certainly shall go -RRB- and we meet again , do n't say a word more on these subjects . 
I beg that particularly . 
And about Dmitri too , I ask you specially , never speak to me again , '' he added , with sudden irritation ; `` it 's all exhausted , it has all been said over and over again , has n't it ? 
And I 'll make you one promise in return for it . 
When at thirty , I want to ` dash the cup to the ground , ' wherever I may be I 'll come to have one more talk with you , even though it were from America , you may be sure of that .
