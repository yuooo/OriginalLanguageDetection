So I said to him : ' I shall leave them with the warder ; if you do n't eat them before evening , it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you ! ' 
With that I went away . 
We quarrelled again , would you believe it ? 
Whenever I go we quarrel . '' 
Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation . 
Maximov , feeling nervous , at once smiled and looked on the floor . 
`` What did you quarrel about this time ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` I did n't expect it in the least . 
Only fancy , he is jealous of the Pole . 
` Why are you keeping him ? ' 
he said . 
` So you 've begun keeping him . ' 
He is jealous , jealous of me all the time , jealous eating and sleeping ! 
He even took into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week . '' 
`` But he knew about the Pole before ? '' 
`` Yes , but there it is . 
He has known about him from the very beginning but to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him . 
I am ashamed to repeat what he said . 
Silly fellow ! 
Rakitin went in as I came out . 
Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on . 
What do you think ? '' 
she added carelessly . 
`` He loves you , that 's what it is ; he loves you so much . 
And now he is particularly worried . '' 
`` I should think he might be , with the trial to-morrow . 
And I went to him to say something about to-morrow , for I dread to think what 's going to happen then . 
You say that he is worried , but how worried I am ! 
And he talks about the Pole ! 
He 's too silly ! 
He is not jealous of Maximushka yet , anyway . '' 
`` My wife was dreadfully jealous over me , too , '' Maximov put in his word . 
`` Jealous of you ? '' 
Grushenka laughed in spite of herself . 
`` Of whom could she have been jealous ? '' 
`` Of the servant girls . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Maximushka , I am in no laughing mood now ; I feel angry . 
Do n't ogle the pies . 
I sha n't give you any ; they are not good for you , and I wo n't give you any vodka either . 
I have to look after him , too , just as though I kept an almshouse , '' she laughed . 
`` I do n't deserve your kindness . 
I am a worthless creature , '' said Maximov , with tears in his voice . 
`` You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me . '' 
`` Ech , everyone is of use , Maximushka , and how can we tell who 's of most use ? 
If only that Pole did n't exist , Alyosha . 
He 's taken it into his head to fall ill , too , to-day . 
I 've been to see him also . 
And I shall send him some pies , too , on purpose . 
I had n't sent him any , but Mitya accused me of it , so now I shall send some !
