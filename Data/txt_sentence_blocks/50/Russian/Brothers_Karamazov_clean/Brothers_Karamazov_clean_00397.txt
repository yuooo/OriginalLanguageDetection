`` Very good , '' he commented at last . 
`` You see , I have n't jumped up , I have n't knocked you down , I have n't killed you . 
Speak on . 
So , according to you , I had fixed on Dmitri to do it ; I was reckoning on him ? '' 
`` How could you help reckoning on him ? 
If he killed him , then he would lose all the rights of a nobleman , his rank and property , and would go off to exile ; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts ; so you 'd each have not forty , but sixty thousand each . 
There 's not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` What I put up with from you ! 
Listen , scoundrel , if I had reckoned on anyone then , it would have been on you , not on Dmitri , and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the time ... . 
I remember my impression ! 
`` I thought , too , for a minute , at the time , that you were reckoning on me as well , '' said Smerdyakov , with a sarcastic grin . 
`` So that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind . 
For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away , you as good as said to me , ` You can murder my parent , I wo n't hinder you ! '' ' 
`` You scoundrel ! 
So that 's how you understood it ! '' 
`` It was all that going to Tchermashnya . 
Why ! 
You were meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father 's entreaties to go to Tchermashnya - and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once ! 
What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya ? 
Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason , simply at my word , it shows that you must have expected something from me . '' 
No , I swear I did n't ! '' 
shouted Ivan , grinding his teeth . 
`` You did n't ? 
Then you ought , as your father 's son , to have had me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least , to have given me a punch in the face on the spot , but you were not a bit angry , if you please , and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away , which was utterly absurd , for you ought to have stayed to save your parent 's life . 
How could I help drawing my conclusions ? '' 
Ivan sat scowling , both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees . 
`` Yes , I am sorry I did n't punch you in the face , '' he said with a bitter smile . 
`` I could n't have taken you to the lock-up just then . 
Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against you ? 
But the punch in the face ... oh , I 'm sorry I did n't think of it . 
Though blows are forbidden , I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly . '' 
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish . 
`` In the ordinary occasions of life , '' he said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch 's table , `` in the ordinary occasions of life , blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law , and people have given them up , but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows , not only among us but all over the world , be it even the fullest republic of France , just as in the time of Adam and Eve , and they never will leave off , but you , even in an exceptional case , did not dare . '' 
`` What are you learning French words for ? '' 
Ivan nodded towards the exercise-book lying on the table . 
`` Why should n't I learn them so as to improve my education , supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe ? '' 
`` Listen , monster . '' 
Ivan 's eyes flashed and he trembled all over . 
`` I am not afraid of your accusations ; you can say what you like about me , and if I do n't beat you to death , it 's simply because I suspect you of that crime and I 'll drag you to justice . 
I 'll unmask you . '' 
`` To my thinking , you 'd better keep quiet , for what can you accuse me of , considering my absolute innocence ? 
And who would believe you ? 
Only if you begin , I shall tell everything , too , for I must defend myself . '' 
`` Do you think I am afraid of you now ? '' 
`` If the court does n't believe all I 've said to you just now , the public will , and you will be ashamed . '' 
`` That 's as much as to say , ` It 's always worth while speaking to a sensible man , ' eh ? '' 
snarled Ivan . 
`` You hit the mark , indeed . 
And you 'd better be sensible . '' 
Ivan got up , shaking all over with indignation , put on his coat , and without replying further to Smerdyakov , without even looking at him , walked quickly out of the cottage .
