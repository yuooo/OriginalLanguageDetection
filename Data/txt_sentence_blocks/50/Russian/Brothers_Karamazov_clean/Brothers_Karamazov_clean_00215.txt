To my abject heart ! '' 
She snatched up a glass from the table , emptied it at a gulp , lifted it in the air and flung it on the floor . 
The glass broke with a crash . 
A little cruel line came into her smile . 
`` Perhaps I have n't forgiven him , though , '' she said , with a sort of menace in her voice , and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though she were talking to herself . 
`` Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive . 
I shall struggle with my heart . 
You see , Alyosha , I 've grown to love my tears in these five years ... . 
Perhaps I only love my resentment , not him ... '' `` Well , I should n't care to be in his shoes , '' hissed Rakitin . 
`` Well , you wo n't be , Rakitin , you 'll never be in his shoes . 
You shall black my shoes , Rakitin , that 's the place you are fit for . 
You 'll never get a woman like me ... and he wo n't either , perhaps ... '' `` Wo n't he ? 
Then why are you dressed up like that ? '' 
said Rakitin , with a venomous sneer . 
`` Do n't taunt me with dressing up , Rakitin , you do n't know all that is in my heart ! 
If I choose to tear off my finery , I 'll tear it off at once , this minute , '' she cried in a resonant voice . 
`` You do n't know what that finery is for , Rakitin ! 
Perhaps I shall see him and say : ` Have you ever seen me look like this before ? ' 
He left me a thin , consumptive cry-baby of seventeen . 
I 'll sit by him , fascinate him and work him up . 
` Do you see what I am like now ? ' 
I 'll say to him ; ` well , and that 's enough for you , my dear sir , there 's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip ! 
That may be what the finery is for , Rakitin . '' 
Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh . 
`` I 'm violent and resentful , Alyosha , I 'll tear off my finery , I 'll destroy my beauty , I 'll scorch my face , slash it with a knife , and turn beggar . 
If I choose , I wo n't go anywhere now to see anyone . 
If I choose , I 'll send Kuzma back all he has ever given me , to-morrow , and all his money and I 'll go out charing for the rest of my life . 
You think I would n't do it , Rakitin , that I would not dare to do it ? 
I would , I would , I could do it directly , only do n't exasperate me ... and I 'll send him about his business , I 'll snap my fingers in his face , he shall never see me again ! '' 
She uttered the last words in an hysterical scream , but broke down again , hid her face in her hands , buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs . 
Rakitin got up . 
`` It 's time we were off , '' he said , `` it 's late , we shall be shut out of the monastery . '' 
Grushenka leapt up from her place . 
`` Surely you do n't want to go , Alyosha ! '' 
she cried , in mournful surprise . 
`` What are you doing to me ? 
You 've stirred up my feeling , tortured me , and now you 'll leave me to face this night alone ! '' 
`` He can hardly spend the night with you ! 
Though if he wants to , let him ! 
I 'll go alone , '' Rakitin scoffed jeeringly . 
`` Hush , evil tongue ! '' 
Grushenka cried angrily at him ; `` you never said such words to me as he has come to say . '' 
`` What has he said to you so special ? '' 
asked Rakitin irritably . 
`` I ca n't say , I do n't know . 
I do n't know what he said to me , it went straight to my heart ; he has wrung my heart ... . 
He is the first , the only one who has pitied me , that 's what it is . 
Why did you not come before , you angel ? '' 
She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy . 
`` I 've been waiting all my life for someone like you , I knew that someone like you would come and forgive me .
