If she were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation , it would be meanness , but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man ... Listen , Alyosha , do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married , and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read them , so you may as well be prepared . '' 
`` Yes , of course , if so - '' muttered Alyosha , `` only it 's not right . '' 
`` Ah , how contemptuous ! 
Alyosha , dear , we wo n't quarrel the very first day . 
I 'd better tell you the whole truth . 
Of course , it 's very wrong to spy on people , and , of course , I am not right and you are , only I shall spy on you all the same . '' 
`` Do , then ; you wo n't find out anything , '' laughed Alyosha . 
`` And Alyosha , will you give in to me ? 
We must decide that too . '' 
`` I shall be delighted to , Lise , and certain to , only not in the most important things . 
Even if you do n't agree with me , I shall do my duty in the most important things . '' 
`` That 's right ; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters , but in everything . 
And I am ready to vow to do so now - in everything , and for all my life ! '' 
cried Lise fervently , `` and I 'll do it gladly , gladly ! 
What 's more , I 'll swear never to spy on you , never once , never to read one of your letters . 
For you are right and I am not . 
And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy , I know that I wo n't do it since you consider it dishonourable . 
You are my conscience now ... . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch , why have you been so sad lately - both yesterday and to-day ? 
I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble , but I see you have some special grief besides , some secret one , perhaps ? '' 
`` Yes , Lise , I have a secret one , too , '' answered Alyosha mournfully . 
`` I see you love me , since you guessed that . '' 
`` What grief ? 
What about ? 
Can you tell me ? '' 
asked Lise with timid entreaty . 
`` I 'll tell you later , Lise - afterwards , '' said Alyosha , confused . 
`` Now you would n't understand it perhaps - and perhaps I could n't explain it . '' 
`` I know your brothers and your father are worrying you , too . '' 
`` Yes , my brothers too , '' murmured Alyosha , pondering . 
`` I do n't like your brother Ivan , Alyosha , '' said Lise suddenly . 
He noticed this remark with some surprise , but did not answer it . 
`` My brothers are destroying themselves , '' he went on , `` my father , too . 
And they are destroying others with them . 
It 's ` the primitive force of the Karamazovs , ' as father Paissy said the other day , a crude , unbridled , earthly force . 
Does the spirit of God move above that force ? 
Even that I do n't know . 
I only know that I , too , am a Karamazov ... . 
Me a monk , a monk ! 
Am I a monk , Lise ? 
You said just now that I was . '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` And perhaps I do n't even believe in God . '' 
`` You do n't believe ? 
What is the matter ? '' 
said Lise quietly and gently . 
But Alyosha did not answer . 
There was something too mysterious , too subjective in these last words of his , perhaps obscure to himself , but yet torturing him . 
`` And now on the top of it all , my friend , the best man in the world is going , is leaving the earth ! 
If you knew , Lise , how bound up in soul I am with him !
