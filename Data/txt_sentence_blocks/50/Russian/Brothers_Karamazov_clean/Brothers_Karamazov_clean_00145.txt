Have you seen Dmitri to-day ? '' 
`` No , but I saw Smerdyakov , '' and Alyosha rapidly , though minutely , described his meeting with Smerdyakov . 
Ivan began listening anxiously and questioned him . 
`` But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him , '' added Alyosha . 
Ivan frowned and pondered . 
`` Are you frowning on Smerdyakov 's account ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , on his account . 
Damn him , I certainly did want to see Dmitri , but now there 's no need , '' said Ivan reluctantly . 
`` But are you really going so soon , brother ? '' 
`` What of Dmitri and father ? 
how will it end ? '' 
asked Alyosha anxiously . 
`` You are always harping upon it ! 
What have I to do with it ? 
Am I my brother Dmitri 's keeper ? '' 
Ivan snapped irritably , but then he suddenly smiled bitterly . 
`` Cain 's answer about his murdered brother , was n't it ? 
Perhaps that 's what you 're thinking at this moment ? 
Well damn it all , I ca n't stay here to be their keeper , can I ? 
I 've finished what I had to do , and I am going . 
Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri , that I 've been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months ? 
Nonsense , I had business of my own . 
I finished it . 
I am going . 
I finished it just now , you were witness . '' 
`` At Katerina Ivanovna 's ? '' 
`` Yes , and I 've released myself once for all . 
And after all , what have I to do with Dmitri ? 
Dmitri does n't come in . 
I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna . 
You know , on the contrary , that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us . 
I did n't ask to do it , but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing . 
It 's all too funny . 
Ah , Alyosha , if you only knew how light my heart is now ! 
Would you believe it , I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom . 
Tfoo ! 
It 's been going on nearly six months , and all at once I 've thrown it off . 
I could never have guessed even yesterday , how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted . '' 
`` You are speaking of your love , Ivan ? '' 
`` Of my love , if you like . 
I fell in love with the young lady , I worried myself over her and she worried me . 
I sat watching over her ... and all at once it 's collapsed ! 
I spoke this morning with inspiration , but I went away and roared with laughter . 
Would you believe it ? 
Yes , it 's the literal truth . '' 
`` You seem very merry about it now , '' observed Alyosha , looking into his face , which had suddenly grown brighter . 
`` But how could I tell that I did n't care for her a bit ! 
Ha ha ! 
It appears after all I did n't .
