A father is jealous of his son 's relation with a woman of loose behaviour and intrigues with the creature to get his son into prison ! 
This is the company in which I have been forced to be present ! 
I was deceived . 
I declare to you all that I was as much deceived as anyone . '' 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly , in an unnatural voice , `` if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a duel ... with pistols , at three paces ... across a handkerchief , '' he ended , stamping with both feet . 
With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest , although at that very moment , or a second later , they are able to whisper to themselves , `` You know you are lying , you shameless old sinner ! 
You 're acting now , in spite of your ` holy ' wrath . '' 
Dmitri frowned painfully , and looked with unutterable contempt at his father . 
`` I thought ... I thought , '' he said . 
in a soft and , as it were , controlled voice , `` that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart , my betrothed , to cherish his old age , and I find nothing but a depraved profligate , a despicable clown ! '' 
`` A duel ! '' 
yelled the old wretch again , breathless and spluttering at each syllable . 
`` And you , Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov , let me tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier , and more honest - you hear - more honest woman than this ` creature , ' as you have dared to call her ! 
And you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , have abandoned your betrothed for that ` creature , ' so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed could n't hold a candle to her . 
That 's the woman called a `` creature '' `` Shameful ! '' 
broke from Father Iosif . 
`` Shameful and disgraceful ! '' 
Kalganov , flushing crimson cried in a boyish voice , trembling with emotion . 
He had been silent till that moment . 
`` Why is such a man alive ? '' 
Dmitri , beside himself with rage , growled in a hollow voice , hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed . 
`` Tell me , can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth ? '' 
He looked round at everyone and pointed at the old man . 
He spoke evenly and deliberately . 
`` Listen , listen , monks , to the parricide ! '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , rushing up to Father Iosif . 
`` That 's the answer to your ` shameful ! ' 
What is shameful ? 
That ` creature , ' that ` woman of loose behaviour ' is perhaps holier than you are yourselves , you monks who are seeking salvation ! 
She fell perhaps in her youth , ruined by her environment . 
But she loved much , and Christ himself forgave the woman ` who loved much . ' '' 
`` It was not for such love Christ forgave her , '' broke impatiently from the gentle Father Iosif . 
`` Yes , it was for such , monks , it was ! 
You save your souls here , eating cabbage , and think you are the righteous . 
You eat a gudgeon a day , and you think you bribe God with gudgeon . '' 
`` This is unendurable ! '' 
was heard on all sides in the cell . 
But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way . 
Father Zossima Father Zossima rose suddenly from his seat . 
Almost distracted with anxiety for the elder and everyone else , Alyosha succeeded , however , in supporting him by the arm . 
Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him . 
Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness , but this was not so . 
The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri 's feet till his forehead touched the floor . 
Alyosha was so astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again . 
There was a faint smile on his lips . 
`` Good-bye ! 
Forgive me , all of you '' he said , bowing on all sides to his guests . 
Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement . 
Bowing down to him - what did it mean ? 
Suddenly he cried aloud , `` Oh God ! ''
