After resting , he went on with his story . 
But he was evidently depressed . 
He was exhausted , mortified , and morally shaken . 
To make things worse the prosecutor exasperated him , as though intentionally , by vexatious interruptions about `` trifling points . '' 
Scarcely had Mitya described how , sitting on the wall , he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle , while the old man had hold of his left leg , and how he then jumped down to look at him , when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall . 
Mitya was surprised . 
`` Oh , I was sitting like this , astride , one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other . '' 
`` And the pestle ? '' 
`` The pestle was in my hand . '' 
`` Not in your pocket ? 
Do you remember that precisely ? 
Was it a violent blow you gave him ? '' 
`` It must have been a violent one . 
But why do you ask ? '' 
`` Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm , and in what direction ? '' 
`` You 're making fun of me , are n't you ? '' 
asked Mitya , looking haughtily at the speaker ; but the latter did not flinch . 
Mitya turned abruptly , sat astride on his chair , and swung his arm . 
`` This was how I struck him ! 
That 's how I knocked him down ! 
What more do you want ? '' 
`` Thank you . 
May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down , with what object , and what you had in view ? '' 
`` Oh , hang it ! 
... I jumped down to look at the man I 'd hurt ... I do n't know what for ! '' 
`` Though you were so excited and were running away ? '' 
`` Yes , though I was excited and running away . '' 
`` You wanted to help him ? '' 
`` Help ! 
... Yes , perhaps I did want to help him ... . 
I do n't remember . '' 
`` You do n't remember ? 
Then you did n't quite know what you were doing ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
I remember everything - every detail . 
I jumped down to look at him , and wiped his face with my handkerchief . '' 
`` We have seen your handkerchief . 
Did you hope to restore him to consciousness ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether I hoped it . 
I simply wanted to make sure whether he was alive or not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
You wanted to be sure ? 
Well , what then ? '' 
`` I 'm not a doctor . 
I could n't decide . 
I ran away thinking I 'd killed him . 
And now he 's recovered . '' 
`` Excellent , '' commented the prosecutor . 
`` Thank you . 
That 's all I wanted .
