Only be sure to come to me to-morrow in the morning . 
Be sure to . 
I have a word to say to you to-morrow . 
Will you come ? '' 
`` When you come , pretend you 've come of your own accord to ask after me . 
Do n't tell anyone I told you to . 
Do n't say a word to Ivan . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
`` Good-bye , my angel . 
You stood up for me , just now . 
I shall never forget it . 
I 've a word to say to you to-morrow - but I must think about it . '' 
`` And how do you feel now ? '' 
`` I shall get up to-morrow and go out , perfectly well , perfectly well ! '' 
Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway . 
He was sitting writing something in pencil in his notebook . 
Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up , was conscious , and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery . 
`` Alyosha , I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning , '' said Ivan cordially , standing up . 
His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha . 
`` I shall be at the Hohlakovs ' to-morrow , '' answered Alyosha , `` I may be at Katerina Ivanovna 's , too , if I do n't find her now . '' 
`` But you 're going to her now , anyway ? 
For that ` compliments and farewell , ' '' said Ivan smiling . 
Alyosha was disconcerted . 
`` I think I quite understand his exclamations just now , and part of what went before . 
Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he - well , in fact - takes his leave of her ? '' 
`` Brother , how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` One ca n't tell for certain . 
Perhaps in nothing : it may all fizzle out . 
That woman is a beast . 
In any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house . '' 
`` Brother , let me ask one thing more : has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live ? '' 
`` Why bring in the question of worth ? 
The matter is most often decided in men 's hearts on other grounds much more natural . 
And as for rights - who has not the right to wish ? '' 
`` Not for another man 's death ? '' 
`` What even if for another man 's death ? 
Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps can not help living so . 
Are you referring to what I said just now - that one reptile will devour the other ? 
In that case let me ask you , do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Aesop 's blood , murdering him , eh ? '' 
`` What are you saying , Ivan ? 
Such an idea never crossed my mind . 
I do n't think Dmitri is capable of it , either . '' 
`` Thanks , if only for that , '' smiled Ivan . 
`` Be sure , I should always defend him . 
But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case . 
Good-bye till to-morrow . 
Do n't condemn me , and do n't look on me as a villain , '' he added with a smile . 
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before . 
Alyosha felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him , and that he had certainly done this with some definite motive .
