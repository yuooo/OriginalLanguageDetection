hid his face in his hands , and rushed out of the room . 
All the guests flocked out after him , in their confusion not saying good-bye , or bowing to their host . 
Only the monks went up to him again for a blessing . 
`` What did it mean , falling at his feet like that ? 
Was it symbolic or what ? '' 
said Fyodor Pavlovitch , suddenly quieted and trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular . 
They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment . 
`` I ca n't answer for a madhouse and for madmen , '' Miusov answered at once ill-humouredly , `` but I will spare myself your company , Fyodor Pavlovitch , and , trust me , for ever . 
Where 's that monk ? '' 
`` That monk , '' that is , the monk who had invited them to dine with the Superior , did not keep them waiting . 
He met them as soon as they came down the steps from the elder 's cell , as though he had been waiting for them all the time . 
`` Reverend Father , kindly do me a favour . 
Convey my deepest respect to the Father Superior , apologise for me , personally , Miusov , to his reverence , telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances I am unable to have the honour of being present at his table , greatly I should desire to do so , '' Miusov said irritably to the monk . 
`` And that unforeseen circumstance , of course , is myself , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch cut in immediately . 
`` Do you hear , Father ; this gentleman does n't want to remain in my company or else he 'd come at once . 
And you shall go , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , pray go to the Father Superior and good appetite to you . 
I will decline , and not you . 
Home , home , I 'll eat at home , I do n't feel equal to it here , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , my amiable relative . '' 
`` I am not your relative and never have been , you contemptible man ! '' 
`` I said it on purpose to madden you , because you always disclaim the relationship , though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling . 
I 'll prove it by the church calendar . 
As for you , Ivan , stay if you like . 
I 'll send the horses for you later . 
Propriety requires you to go to the Father Superior , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , to apologise for the disturbance we 've been making ... '' `` Is it true that you are going home ? 
Are n't you lying ? '' 
`` Pyotr Alexandrovitch ! 
How could I dare after what 's happened ! 
Forgive me , gentlemen , I was carried away ! 
And upset besides ! 
And , indeed , I am ashamed . 
Gentlemen , one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon and another the heart of the little dog Fido . 
Mine is that of the little dog Fido . 
I am ashamed ! 
After such an escapade how can I go to dinner , to gobble up the monastery 's sauces ? 
I am ashamed , I ca n't . 
You must excuse me ! '' 
`` The devil only knows , what if he deceives us ? '' 
thought Miusov , still hesitating , and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes . 
The latter turned round , and noticing that Miusov was watching him , waved him a kiss . 
`` Well , are you coming to the Superior ? '' 
Miusov asked Ivan abruptly . 
`` Why not ? 
I was especially invited yesterday . '' 
`` Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner , '' said Miusov with the same irritability , regardless of the fact that the monk was listening . 
`` We ought , at least , to apologise for the disturbance , and explain that it was not our doing . 
What do you think ? '' 
`` Yes , we must explain that it was n't our doing . 
Besides , father wo n't be there , '' observed Ivan . 
`` Well , I should hope not ! 
Confound this dinner ! ''
