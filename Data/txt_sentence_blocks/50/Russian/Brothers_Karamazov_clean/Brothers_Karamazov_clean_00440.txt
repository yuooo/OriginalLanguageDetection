`` I am like the peasant girl , your excellency ... you know . 
How does it go ? 
` I 'll stand up if I like , and I wo n't if I do n't . ' 
They were trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church to be married , and she said , ` I 'll stand up if I like , and I wo n't if I do n't . ' 
... It 's in some book about the peasantry . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
the President asked severely . 
`` Why , this , '' Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes . 
`` Here 's the money ... the notes that lay in that envelope '' -LRB- he nodded towards the table on which lay the material evidence -RRB- , `` for the sake of which our father was murdered . 
Where shall I put them ? 
Mr. Superintendent , take them . '' 
The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President . 
`` How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same money ? '' 
the President asked wonderingly . 
`` I got them from Smerdyakov , from the murderer , yesterday ... . 
I was with him just before he hanged himself . 
It was he , not my brother , killed our father . 
He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who does n't desire his father 's death ? '' 
`` Are you in your right mind ? '' 
broke involuntarily from the President . 
`` I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all of you ... as all these ... ugly faces . '' 
He turned suddenly to the audience . 
`` My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified , '' he snarled , with furious contempt . 
`` They keep up the sham with one another . 
Liars ! 
They all desire the death of their fathers . 
One reptile devours another ... . 
If there had n't been a murder , they 'd have been angry and gone home ill-humoured . 
It 's a spectacle they want ! 
Panem et circenses . 
* Though I am one to talk ! 
Have you any water ? 
Give me a drink for Christ 's sake ! '' 
He suddenly clutched his head . 
* Bread and circuses . 
The usher at once approached him . 
Alyosha jumped up and cried , `` He is ill . 
Do n't believe him : he has brain fever . '' 
Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat and , rigid with horror , gazed at Ivan . 
Mitya stood up and greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild , strange smile . 
`` Do n't disturb yourselves . 
I am not mad , I am only a murderer , '' Ivan began again . 
`` You ca n't expect eloquence from a murderer , '' he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh . 
The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay . 
The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers . 
Fetyukovitch pricked up his ears as he listened : the hall was hushed in expectation . 
The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself . 
`` Witness , your words are incomprehensible and impossible here . 
Calm yourself , if you can , and tell your story ... if you really have something to tell . 
How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not delirious ? ''
