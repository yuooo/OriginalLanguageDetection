And yet it was she who had betrayed him . 
`` Perhaps because she feels how she 's wronged him she hates him at moments , '' Alyosha thought to himself . 
He hoped that it was only `` at moments . '' 
In Katya 's last words he detected a challenging note , but he did not take it up . 
`` I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself . 
Or do you , too , consider that to escape would be dishonourable , cowardly , or something ... unchristian , perhaps ? '' 
Katya added , even more defiantly . 
`` Oh , no . 
I 'll tell him everything , '' muttered Alyosha . 
`` He asks you to come and see him to-day , '' he blurted out suddenly , looking her steadily in the face . 
She started , and drew back a little from him on the sofa . 
`` Me ? 
Can that be ? '' 
She faltered , turning pale . 
`` It can and ought to be ! '' 
Alyosha began emphatically , growing more animated . 
`` He needs you particularly just now . 
I would not have opened the subject and worried you , if it were not necessary . 
He is ill , he is beside himself , he keeps asking for you . 
It is not to be reconciled with you that he wants you , but only that you would go and show yourself at his door . 
So much has happened to him since that day . 
He realises that he has injured you beyond all reckoning . 
He does not ask your forgiveness - ` It 's impossible to forgive me , ' he says himself - but only that you would show yourself in his doorway . '' 
`` It 's so sudden ... '' faltered Katya . 
`` I 've had a presentiment all these days that you would come with that message . 
I knew he would ask me to come . 
It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Let it be impossible , but do it . 
Only think , he realises for the first time how he has wounded you , the first time in his life ; he had never grasped it before so fully . 
He said , ` If she refuses to come I shall be unhappy all my life . ' 
you hear ? 
though he is condemned to penal servitude for twenty years , he is still planning to be happy - is not that piteous ? 
Think - you must visit him ; though he is ruined , he is innocent , '' broke like a challenge from Alyosha . 
`` His hands are clean , there is no blood on them ! 
For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now . 
Go , greet him on his way into the darkness - stand at his door , that is all ... . 
You ought to do it , you ought to ! '' 
Alyosha concluded , laying immense stress on the word `` ought . '' 
`` I ought to ... but I can not ... '' Katya moaned . 
`` He will look at me ... . 
I ca n't . '' 
`` Your eyes ought to meet . 
How will you live all your life , if you do n't make up your mind to do it now ? '' 
`` Better suffer all my life . '' 
`` You ought to go , you ought to go , '' Alyosha repeated with merciless emphasis . 
`` But why to-day , why at once ? 
... I ca n't leave our patient - '' `` You can for a moment . 
It will only be a moment . 
If you do n't come , he will be in delirium by to-night . 
I would not tell you a lie ; have pity on him ! ''
