And Rakitin does dislike God . 
Ough ! 
does n't he dislike Him ! 
That 's the sore point with all of them . 
But they conceal it . 
They tell lies . 
They pretend . 
` Will you preach this in your reviews ? ' 
I asked him . 
` Oh , well , if I did it openly , they wo n't let it through , ` he said . 
He laughed . 
` But what will become of men then ? ' 
I asked him , ` without God and immortal life ? 
All things are lawful then , they can do what they like ? ' 
` Did n't you know ? ' 
he said laughing , ' a clever man can do what he likes , ' he said . ' 
A clever man knows his way about , but you 've put your foot in it , committing a murder , and now you are rotting in prison . ' 
He says that to my face ! 
A regular pig ! 
I used to kick such people out , but now I listen to them . 
He talks a lot of sense , too . 
Writes well . 
He began reading me an article last week . 
I copied out three lines of it . 
Wait a minute . 
Here it is . '' 
Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read : '' ` In order to determine this question , it is above all essential to put one 's personality in contradiction to one 's reality . ' 
Do you understand that ? '' 
`` No , I do n't , '' said Alyosha . 
He looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity . 
`` I do n't understand either . 
It 's dark and obscure , but intellectual . 
` Everyone writes like that now , ' he says , ` it 's the effect of their environment . ' 
They are afraid of the environment . 
He writes poetry , too , the rascal . 
He 's written in honour of Madame Hohlakov 's foot . 
Ha ha ha ! '' 
`` I 've heard about it , '' said Alyosha . 
`` Have you ? 
And have you heard the poem ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I 've got it . 
Here it is . 
I 'll read it to you . 
You do n't know - I have n't told you - there 's quite a story about it . 
He 's a rascal ! 
Three weeks ago he began to tease me . 
` You 've got yourself into a mess , like a fool , for the sake of three thousand , but I 'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand . 
I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg . ' 
And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov .
