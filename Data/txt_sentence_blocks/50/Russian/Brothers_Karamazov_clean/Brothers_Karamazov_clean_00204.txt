Are you angry with someone ? 
Have they been ill-treating you ? '' 
`` Let me alone , '' said Alyosha suddenly , with a weary gesture of his hand , still looking away from him . 
`` Oho ! 
So that 's how we are feeling ! 
So you can shout at people like other mortals . 
That is a come-down from the angels . 
I say , Alyosha , you have surprised me , do you hear ? 
I mean it . 
It 's long since I 've been surprised at anything here . 
I always took you for an educated man . 
Alyosha at last looked at him , but vaguely , as though scarcely understanding what he said . 
`` Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to stink ? 
You do n't mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to work miracles ? '' 
exclaimed Rakitin , genuinely surprised again . 
`` I believed , I believe , I want to believe , and I will believe , what more do you want ? '' 
cried Alyosha irritably . 
`` Nothing at all , my boy . 
Damn it all ! 
why , no schoolboy of thirteen believes in that now . 
But there ... So now you are in a temper with your God , you are rebelling against Him ; He has n't given promotion , He has n't bestowed the order of merit ! 
Eh , you are a set ! '' 
Alyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin , and there was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin . 
`` I am not rebelling against my God ; I simply ` do n't accept His world . ' '' 
Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile . 
`` How do you mean , you do n't accept the world ? '' 
Rakitin thought a moment over his answer . 
`` What idiocy is this ? '' 
Alyosha did not answer . 
`` Come , enough nonsense , now to business . 
Have you had anything to eat to-day ? '' 
`` I do n't remember ... . 
I think I have . '' 
`` You need keeping up , to judge by your face . 
It makes one sorry to look at you . 
You did n't sleep all night either , I hear ; you had a meeting in there . 
And then all this bobbery afterwards . 
Most likely you 've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread . 
I 've got some sausage in my pocket ; I 've brought it from the town in case of need , only you wo n't eat sausage ... '' `` Give me some . '' 
`` I say ! 
You are going it ! 
Why , it 's a regular mutiny , with barricades ! 
Well , my boy , we must make the most of it . 
Come to my place ... should n't mind a drop of vodka myself , I am tired to death . 
Vodka is going too far for you , I suppose ... or would you like some ? '' 
`` Give me some vodka too . '' 
`` Hullo ! 
You surprise me , brother ! '' 
Rakitin looked at him in amazement . 
`` Well , one way or another , vodka or sausage , this is a jolly fine chance and must n't be missed .
