I 'll tell you where I got the money ! 
... I 'll reveal my shame , that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter . '' 
`` And believe me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch , in a voice of almost pathetic delight , `` that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may , later on , have an immense influence in your favour , and may , indeed , moreover - '' But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table , and he checked himself in time . 
Mitya , it is true , had not heard him . 
Mitya 's Great Secret Received with Hisses `` GENTLEMEN , '' he began , still in the same agitation , `` I want to make a full confession : that money was my own . '' 
The lawyer 's faces lengthened . 
That was not at all what they expected . 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` when at five o'clock on the same day , from your own confession - '' `` Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession ! 
That 's nothing to do with it now ! 
That money was my own , my own , that is , stolen by me ... not mine , I mean , but stolen by me , and it was fifteen hundred roubles , and I had it on me all the time , all the time ... '' `` But where did you get it ? '' 
`` I took it off my neck , gentlemen , off this very neck ... it was here , round my neck , sewn up in a rag , and I 'd had it round my neck a long time , it 's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace ! '' 
`` And from whom did you ... appropriate it ? '' 
`` You mean , ` steal it ' ? 
Speak out plainly now . 
Yes , I consider that I practically stole it , but , if you prefer , I ` appropriated it . ' 
I consider I stole it . 
And last night I stole it finally . '' 
`` Last night ? 
But you said that it 's a month since you ... obtained it ? 
... '' `` Yes . 
But not from my father . 
Not from my father , do n't be uneasy . 
I did n't steal it from my father , but from her . 
Let me tell you without interrupting . 
It 's hard to do , you know . 
You see , a month ago , I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna , formerly my betrothed . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` I know you know her . 
She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that . 
No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me .
