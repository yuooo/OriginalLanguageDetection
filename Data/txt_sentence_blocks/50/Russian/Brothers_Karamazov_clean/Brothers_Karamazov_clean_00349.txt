I do n't remember . 
He has n't written that anywhere . '' 
`` If he did n't write it , they say he said it . 
I heard that from a. . . 
but never mind . '' 
`` And have you read Byelinsky ? '' 
`` Well , no ... I have n't read all of him , but ... I read the passage about Tatyana , why she did n't go off with Onyegin . '' 
`` Did n't go off with Onyegin ? 
Surely you do n't ... understand that already ? '' 
`` Why , you seem to take me for little Smurov , '' said Kolya , with a grin of irritation . 
`` But please do n't suppose I am such a revolutionist . 
I often disagree with Mr. Rakitin . 
Though I mention Tatyana , I am not at all for the emancipation of women . 
I acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey . 
Les femmes tricottent , * Napoleon said . '' 
Kolya , for some reason , smiled , `` And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with that pseudo-great man . 
I think , too , that to leave one 's own country and fly to America is mean , worse than mean - silly . 
Why go to America when one may be of great service to humanity here ? 
Now especially . 
There 's a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us . 
That 's what I answered . '' 
* Let the women knit . 
`` What do you mean ? 
Answered whom ? 
Has someone suggested your going to America already ? '' 
`` I must own , they 've been at me to go , but I declined . 
That 's between ourselves , of course , Karamazov ; do you hear , not a word to anyone . 
I say this only to you . 
I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge . 
Long will you remember The house at the Chain bridge . 
Do you remember ? 
It 's splendid . 
Why are you laughing ? 
You do n't suppose I am fibbing , do you ? '' 
-LRB- `` What if he should find out that I 've only that one number of The Bell in father 's book case , and have n't read any more of it ? '' 
Kolya thought with a shudder . -RRB- 
`` Oh no , I am not laughing and do n't suppose for a moment that you are lying . 
No , indeed , I ca n't suppose so , for all this , alas ! 
is perfectly true . 
But tell me , have you read Pushkin - Onyegin , for instance ? 
... You spoke just now of Tatyana . '' 
`` No , I have n't read it yet , but I want to read it . 
I have no prejudices , Karamazov ; I want to hear both sides . 
What makes you ask ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Karamazov , have you an awful contempt for me ? '' 
Kolya rapped out suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha , as though he were on drill . 
`` Be so kind as to tell me , without beating about the bush . '' 
`` I have a contempt for you ? '' 
Alyosha looked at him wondering .
