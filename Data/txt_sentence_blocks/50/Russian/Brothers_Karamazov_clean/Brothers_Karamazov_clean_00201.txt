shouted Father Ferapont crazily . 
`` I 've come here to drive out your visitors , the unclean devils . 
I 've come to see how many have gathered here while I have been away . 
I want to sweep them out with a birch broom . '' 
`` You cast out the evil spirit , but perhaps you are serving him yourself , '' Father Paissy went on fearlessly . 
`` And who can say of himself ' I am holy ' ? 
Can you , Father ? '' 
`` I am unclean , not holy . 
I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not have them bow down to me as an idol , '' thundered Father Ferapont . 
`` Nowadays folk destroy the true faith . 
The dead man , your saint , '' he turned to the crowd , pointing with his finger to the coffin , `` did not believe in devils . 
He gave medicine to keep off the devils . 
And so they have become as common as spiders in the corners . 
And now he has begun to stink himself . 
In that we see a great sign from God . '' 
The incident he referred to was this . 
One of the monks was haunted in his dreams and , later on , in waking moments , by visions of evil spirits . 
When in the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima , the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting . 
But when that was of no use , he advised him while persisting in prayer and fasting , to take a special medicine . 
Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they talked over it - and most of all Father Ferapont , to whom some of the censorious had hastened to report this `` extraordinary '' counsel on the part of the elder . 
`` Go away , Father ! '' 
said Father Paissy , in a commanding voice , `` it 's not for man to judge but for God . 
Perhaps we see here a ` sign ' which neither you , nor I , nor anyone of us is able to comprehend . 
Go , Father , and do not trouble the flock ! '' 
he repeated impressively . 
`` He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign has come . 
That is clear and it 's a sin to hide it , '' the fanatic , carried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason , would not be quieted . 
`` He was seduced by sweetmeats , ladies brought them to him in their pockets , he sipped tea , he worshipped his belly , filling it with sweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts ... . 
And for this he is put to shame ... '' `` You speak lightly , Father . '' 
Father Paissy , too , raised his voice . 
`` I admire your fasting and severities , but you speak lightly like some frivolous youth , fickle and childish . 
Go away , Father , I command you ! '' 
Father Paissy thundered in conclusion . 
`` I will go , '' said Ferapont , seeming somewhat taken aback , but still as bitter . 
`` You learned men ! 
You are so clever you look down upon my humbleness . 
I came hither with little learning and here I have forgotten what I did know ; God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your subtlety . '' 
Father Paissy stood over him , waiting resolutely . 
Father Ferapont paused and , suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently , pronounced in a sing-song , voice , looking at the coffin of the dead elder : `` To-morrow they will sing over him ` Our Helper and Defender ' - a splendid anthem - and over me when I die all they 'll sing will be ` What Earthly Joy ' - a little cantical , '' * he added with tearful regret . 
`` You are proud and puffed up , this is a vain place ! '' 
he shouted suddenly like a madman , and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the steps . 
The crowd awaiting him below wavered ; some followed him at once and some lingered , for the cell was still open , and Father Paissy , following Father Ferapont on to the steps , stood watching him . 
the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced . 
Walking twenty steps away , he suddenly turned towards the setting sun , raised both his arms and , as though someone had cut him down , fell to the ground with a loud scream . 
* When a monk 's body is carried out from the cell to the church and from the church to the graveyard , the canticle `` What Earthly Joy ... '' is sung . 
If the deceased was a priest as well as a monk the canticle `` Our Helper and Defender '' is sung instead . 
`` My God has conquered ! 
Christ has conquered the setting sun ! '' 
he shouted frantically , stretching up his hands to the sun , and falling face downwards on the ground , he sobbed like a little child , shaken by his tears and spreading out his arms on the ground . 
Then all rushed up to him ; there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of them all .
