`` Women are often dishonourable , '' she snarled . 
`` Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no , he is still a human being to me ! 
But did he do it ? 
Is he the murderer ? '' 
she cried , all of a sudden , hysterically , turning quickly to Ivan . 
Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before , perhaps only a moment before he came in , and not for the first time , but for the hundredth , and that they had ended by quarrelling . 
`` I 've been to see Smerdyakov ... . 
It was you , you who persuaded me that he murdered his father . 
It 's only you I believed '' she continued , still addressing Ivan . 
He gave her a sort of strained smile . 
Alyosha started at her tone . 
He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them . 
`` Well , that 's enough , anyway , '' Ivan cut short the conversation . 
`` I am going . 
I 'll come to-morrow . '' 
And turning at once , he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs . 
With an imperious gesture , Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands . 
`` Follow him ! 
Overtake him ! 
Do n't leave him alone for a minute ! '' 
she said , in a hurried whisper . 
`` He 's mad ! 
Do n't you know that he 's mad ? 
He is in a fever , nervous fever . 
The doctor told me so . 
Go , run after him ... '' Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan , who was not fifty paces ahead of him . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
He turned quickly on Alyosha , seeing that he was running after him . 
`` She told you to catch me up , because I 'm mad . 
I know it all by heart , '' he added irritably . 
`` She is mistaken , of course ; but she is right that you are ill , '' said Alyosha . 
`` I was looking at your face just now . 
You look very ill , Ivan . '' 
Ivan walked on without stopping . 
Alyosha followed him . 
`` And do you know , Alexey Fyodorovitch , how people do go out of their minds ? '' 
Ivan asked in a a voice suddenly quiet , without a trace of irritation , with a note of the simplest curiosity . 
`` No , I do n't . 
I suppose there are all kinds of insanity . '' 
`` And can one observe that one 's going mad oneself ? '' 
`` I imagine one ca n't see oneself clearly in such circumstances , '' Alyosha answered with surprise . 
Ivan paused for half a minute . 
`` If you want to talk to me , please change the subject , '' he said suddenly . 
`` Oh , while I think of it , I have a letter for you , '' said Alyosha timidly , and he took Lise 's note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan . 
They were just under a lamp-post . 
Ivan recognised the handwriting at once . 
`` Ah , from that little demon ! '' 
he laughed maliciously , and , without opening the envelope , he tore it into bits and threw it in the air . 
The bits were scattered by the wind . 
`` She 's not sixteen yet , I believe , and already offering herself , '' he said contemptuously , striding along the street again .
