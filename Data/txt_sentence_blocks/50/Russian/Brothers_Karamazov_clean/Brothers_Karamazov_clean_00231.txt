Yet , I did expect you . 
You may marvel at my instinct , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , but I was convinced all the morning that you would come . '' 
`` That is certainly wonderful , madam , '' observed Mitya , sitting down limply , `` but I have come to you on a matter of great importance ... . 
On a matter of supreme importance for me , that is , madam ... for me alone ... and I hasten - '' `` I know you 've come on most important business . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch ; it 's not a case of presentiment , no reactionary harking back to the miraculous -LRB- have you heard about Father Zossima ? -RRB- . 
This is a case of mathematics : you could n't help coming , after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna ; you could n't , you could n't , that 's a mathematical certainty . '' 
`` The realism of actual life , madam , that 's what it is . 
But allow me to explain - '' `` Realism indeed , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
I 'm all for realism now . 
I 've seen too much of miracles . 
You 've heard that Father Zossima is dead ? '' 
`` No , madam , it 's the first time I 've heard of it . '' 
Mitya was a little surprised . 
The image of Alyosha rose to his mind . 
`` Last night , and only imagine - '' `` Madam , '' said Mitya , `` I can imagine nothing except that I 'm in a desperate position , and that if you do n't help me , everything will come to grief , and I first of all . 
Excuse me for the triviality of the expression , but I 'm in a fever - '' `` I know , I know that you 're in a fever . 
You could hardly fail to be , and whatever you may say to me , I know beforehand . 
I have long been thinking over your destiny , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I am watching over it and studying it ... . 
Oh , believe me , I 'm an experienced doctor of the soul , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Madam , if you are an experienced doctor , I 'm certainly an experienced patient , '' said Mitya , with an effort to be polite , `` and I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way , you will come to my help in my ruin , and so allow me , at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you ... . 
I have come , madam - '' `` Do n't explain it . 
It 's of secondary importance . 
But as for help , you 're not the first I have helped , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You have most likely heard of my cousin , Madame Belmesov . 
Her husband was ruined , ` had come to grief , ' as you characteristically express it , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
I recommended him to take to horse-breeding , and now he 's doing well . 
Have you any idea of horse-breeding , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? '' 
`` Not the faintest , madam ; ah , madam , not the faintest ! '' 
cried Mitya , in nervous impatience , positively starting from his seat . 
`` I simply implore you , madam , to listen to me . 
Only give me two minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything , the whole plan with which I have come . 
Besides , I am short of time . 
I 'm in a fearful hurry , '' Mitya cried hysterically , feeling that she was just going to begin talking again , and hoping to cut her short . 
`` I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair , to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand , a loan , but on safe , most safe security , madam , with the most trustworthy guarantees ! 
Only let me explain - '' `` You must tell me all that afterwards , afterwards ! '' 
Madame Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn , `` and whatever you may tell me , I know it all beforehand ; I 've told you so already . 
You ask for a certain sum , for three thousand , but I can give you more , immeasurably more ; I will save you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , but you must listen to me . '' 
Mitya started from his seat again . 
`` Madam , will you really be so good ! '' 
he cried , with strong feeling . 
`` Good God , you 've saved me ! 
You have saved a man from a violent death , from a bullet ... . 
My eternal gratitude `` I will give you more , infinitely more than three thousand ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , looking with a radiant smile at Mitya 's ecstasy . 
`` Infinitely ? 
But I do n't need so much . 
I only need that fatal three thousand , and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite gratitude , and I propose a plan which - '' `` Enough , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , it 's said and done . '' 
Madame Hohlakov cut him short , with the modest triumph of beneficence . 
`` I have promised to save you , and I will save you . 
I will save you as I did Belmesov .
