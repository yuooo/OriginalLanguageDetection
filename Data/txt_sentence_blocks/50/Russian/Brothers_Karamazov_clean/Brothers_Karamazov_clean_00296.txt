They seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention . 
A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya 's soul . 
`` Why , you 're laughing at me at this moment , gentlemen ! '' 
he broke off suddenly . 
`` What makes you think that ? '' 
observed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You do n't believe one word - that 's why ! 
I understand , of course , that I have come to the vital point . 
The old man 's lying there now with his skull broken , while I - after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him , and how I snatched up the pestle - I suddenly run away from the window . 
A romance ! 
Poetry ! 
As though one could believe a fellow on his word . 
Ha ha ! 
You are scoffers , gentlemen ! '' 
And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked . 
`` And did you notice , '' asked the prosecutor suddenly , as though not observing Mitya 's excitement , `` did you notice when you ran away from the window , whether the door into the garden was open ? '' 
`` No , it was not open . '' 
`` It was not ? '' 
`` It was shut . 
And who could open it ? 
Bah ! 
the door . 
Wait a bit ! '' 
he seemed suddenly to bethink himself , and almost with a start : `` Why , did you find the door open ? '' 
`` Yes , it was open . '' 
`` Why , who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves ? '' 
cried Mitya , greatly astonished . 
`` The door stood open , and your father 's murderer undoubtedly went in at that door , and , having accomplished the crime , went out again by the same door , '' the prosecutor pronounced deliberately , as though chiselling out each word separately . 
`` That is perfectly clear . 
The murder was committed in the room and not through the window ; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made , from the position of the body and everything . 
There can be no doubt of that circumstance . '' 
Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded . 
`` But that 's utterly impossible ! '' 
he cried , completely at a loss . 
`` I. . . 
I did n't go in ... . 
I tell you positively , definitely , the door was shut the whole time I was in the garden , and when I ran out of the garden . 
I only stood at the window and saw him through the window . 
That 's all , that 's all ... . 
I remember to the last minute . 
And if I did n't remember , it would be just the same . 
I know it , for no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov , and me , and the dead man . 
And he would n't have opened the door to anyone in the world without the signals . '' 
`` Signals ? 
What signals ? '' 
asked the prosecutor , with greedy , almost hysterical , curiosity . 
He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and dignity . 
He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity . 
He scented an important fact of which he had known nothing , and was already filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it . 
`` So you did n't know ! ''
