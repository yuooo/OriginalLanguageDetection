You might see the gates of heaven open , not only the door into the garden ? '' 
Grigory remained silent . 
There was another laugh in the court . 
The President made a movement . 
`` Do you know for a fact , '' Fetyukovitch persisted , `` whether you were awake or not when you saw the open door ? '' 
`` I was on my legs . '' 
`` That 's not a proof that you were awake . '' 
-LRB- There was again laughter in the court . -RRB- 
`` Could you have answered at that moment , if anyone had asked you a question - for instance , what year it is ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` And what year is it , Anno Domini , do you know ? '' 
Grigory stood with a perplexed face , looking straight at his tormentor . 
Strange to say , it appeared he really did not know what year it was . 
`` But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands ? '' 
`` I am a servant , '' Grigory said suddenly , in a loud and distinct voice . 
`` If my betters think fit to make game of me , it is my duty to suffer it . '' 
Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback , and the President intervened , reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions . 
Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness . 
The public and the jury , of course , were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might , while undergoing a certain cure , have seen `` the gates of heaven , '' and who did not even know what year he was living in . 
But before Grigory left the box another episode occurred . 
The President , turning to the prisoner , asked him whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness . 
`` Except about the door , all he has said is true , '' cried Mitya , in a loud voice . 
`` For combing the lice off me , I thank him ; for forgiving my blows , I thank him . 
The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred poodles . '' 
`` Prisoner , be careful in your language , '' the President admonished him . 
`` I am not a poodle , '' Grigory muttered . 
`` All right , it 's I am a poodle myself , '' cried Mitya . 
`` If it 's an insult , I take it to myself and I beg his pardon . 
I was a beast and cruel to him . 
I was cruel to Aesop too . '' 
`` What Aesop ? '' 
the President asked sternly again . 
`` Oh , Pierrot ... my father , Fyodor Pavlovitch . '' 
The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly to be more careful in his language . 
`` You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges . '' 
The counsel for the defence was equally clever in dealing with the evidence of Rakitin . 
I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance . 
It appeared that he knew everything ; his knowledge was amazing , he had been everywhere , seen everything , talked to everybody , knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs . 
Of the envelope , it is true , he had only heard from Mitya himself . 
But he described minutely Mitya 's exploits in the Metropolis , all his compromising doings and sayings , and told the story of Captain Snegiryov 's `` wisp of tow . '' 
But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya 's inheritance , and confined himself to contemptuous generalities . 
`` Who could tell which of them was to blame , and which was in debt to the other , with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one could make head or tail of it ? '' 
He attributed the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia , due to the lack of appropriate institutions . 
He was , in fact , allowed some latitude of speech . 
This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he could do , and attracted notice . 
The prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the case , and afterwards in his speech , as we shall see later , quoted some ideas from the article , showing that he had seen it already . 
The picture drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one , and greatly strengthened the case for the prosecution . 
Altogether , Rakatin 's discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility of its ideas . 
There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia . 
But Rakitin , in his youthful ardour , made a slight blunder , of which the counsel for the defence at once adroitly took advantage .
