`` I said to him , ` Then everything is lawful , if it is so ? ' 
He frowned . 
` Fyodor Pavlovitch , our papa , ' he said , ` was a pig , but his ideas were right enough . ' 
That was what he dropped . 
That was all he said . 
That was going one better than Rakitin . '' 
`` Yes , '' Alyosha assented bitterly . 
`` When was he with you ? '' 
`` Of that later ; now I must speak of something else . 
I have said nothing about Ivan to you before . 
I put it off to the last . 
When my business here is over and the verdict has been given , then I 'll tell you something . 
I 'll tell you everything . 
We 've something tremendous on hand ... . 
And you shall be my judge in it . 
But do n't begin about that now ; be silent . 
You talk of to-morrow , of the trial ; but , would you believe it , I know nothing about it . '' 
`` Have you talked to the counsel ? '' 
`` What 's the use of the counsel ? 
I told him all about it . 
He 's a soft , city-bred rogue - a Bernard ! 
But he does n't believe me - not a bit of it . 
Only imagine , he believes I did it . 
I see it . 
` In that case , ' I asked him , ` why have you come to defend me ? ' 
Hang them all ! 
They 've got a doctor down , too , want to prove I 'm mad . 
I wo n't have that ! 
Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her ` duty ' to the end , whatever the strain ! '' 
Mitya smiled bitterly . 
`` The cat ! 
Hard-hearted creature ! 
She knows that I said of her at Mokroe that she was a woman of ` great wrath . ' 
They repeated it . 
Yes , the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea . 
Grigory sticks to his point . 
Grigory 's honest , but a fool . 
Many people are honest because they are fools : that 's Rakitin 's idea . 
Grigory 's my enemy . 
And there are some people who are better as foes than friends . 
I mean Katerina Ivanovna . 
I am afraid , oh , I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand . 
She 'll pay it back to the last farthing . 
I do n't want her sacrifice ; they 'll put me to shame at the trial . 
I wonder how I can stand it . 
Go to her , Alyosha , ask her not to speak of that in the court , ca n't you ? 
But damn it all , it does n't matter ! 
I shall get through somehow . 
I do n't pity her . 
It 's her own doing .
