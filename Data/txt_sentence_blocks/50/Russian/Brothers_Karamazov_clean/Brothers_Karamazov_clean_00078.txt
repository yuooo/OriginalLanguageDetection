What do you bet that I 'll catch you to-morrow ? 
Speak , all the same , is there a God , or not ? 
Only , be serious . 
I want you to be serious now . '' 
`` No , there is no God . '' 
`` Alyosha , is there a God ? '' 
`` There is . '' 
`` Ivan , and is there immortality of some sort , just a little , just a tiny bit ? '' 
`` There is no immortality either . '' 
`` None at all ? '' 
`` None at all . '' 
`` There 's absolute nothingness then . 
Perhaps there is just something ? 
Anything is better than nothing ! '' 
`` Alyosha , is there immortality ? '' 
`` God and immortality ? '' 
`` God and immortality . 
In God is immortality . '' 
`` H 'm ! 
It 's more likely Ivan 's right . 
Good Lord ! 
to think what faith , what force of all kinds , man has lavished for nothing , on that dream , and for how many thousand years . 
Who is it laughing at man ? 
Ivan For the last time , once for all , is there a God or not ? 
I ask for the last time ! '' 
`` And for the last time there is not . '' 
`` Who is laughing at mankind , Ivan ? '' 
`` It must be the devil , '' said Ivan , smiling . 
`` And the devil ? 
Does he exist ? '' 
`` No , there 's no devil either . '' 
`` It 's a pity . 
Damn it all , what would n't I do to the man who first invented God ! 
Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for , him . '' 
`` There would have been no civilisation if they had n't invented God . '' 
`` Would n't there have been ? 
Without God ? '' 
`` No . 
And there would have been no brandy either . 
But I must take your brandy away from you , anyway . '' 
`` Stop , stop , stop , dear boy , one more little glass . 
I 've hurt Alyosha 's feelings . 
You 're not angry with me , Alyosha ? 
My dear little Alexey ! '' 
`` No , I am not angry . 
I know your thoughts . 
Your heart is better than your head . '' 
`` My heart better than my head , is it ? 
Oh Lord ! 
And that from you .
