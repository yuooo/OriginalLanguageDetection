`` Yes , '' Mitya admitted . 
`` She wo n't come this morning . '' 
He looked timidly at his brother . 
`` She wo n't come till the evening . 
When I told her yesterday that Katya was taking measures , she was silent , but she set her mouth . 
She only whispered , ` Let her ! ' 
She understood that it was important . 
I did not dare to try her further . 
She understands now , I think , that Katya no longer cares for me , but loves Ivan . '' 
`` Does she ? '' 
broke from Alyosha . 
`` Perhaps she does not . 
Only she is not coming this morning , '' Mitya hastened to explain again ; `` I asked her to do something for me . 
You know , Ivan is superior to all of us . 
He ought to live , not us . 
He will recover . '' 
`` Would you believe it , though Katya is alarmed about him , she scarcely doubts of his recovery , '' said Alyosha . 
`` That means that she is convinced he will die . 
It 's because she is frightened she 's so sure he will get well . '' 
`` Ivan has a strong constitution , and I , too , believe there 's every hope that he will get well , '' Alyosha observed anxiously . 
`` Yes , he will get well . 
But she is convinced that he will die . 
She has a great deal of sorrow to bear ... '' A silence followed . 
A grave anxiety was fretting Mitya . 
`` Alyosha , I love Grusha terribly , '' he said suddenly in a shaking voice , full of tears . 
`` They wo n't let her go out there to you , '' Alyosha put in at once . 
`` And there is something else I wanted tell you , '' Mitya went on , with a sudden ring in his voice . 
`` If they beat me on the way or out there , I wo n't submit to it . 
I shall kill someone , and shall be shot for it . 
And this will be going on for twenty years ! 
They speak to me rudely as it is . 
I 've been lying here all night , passing judgment on myself . 
I am not ready ! 
I am not able to resign myself . 
I wanted to sing a ` hymn ' ; but if a guard speaks rudely to me , I have not the strength to bear it . 
For Grusha I would bear anything ... anything except blows ... . 
But she wo n't be allowed to come there . '' 
Alyosha smiled gently . 
`` Listen , brother , once for all , '' he said . 
`` This is what I think about it . 
And you know that I would not tell you a lie . 
Listen : you are not ready , and such a cross is not for you . 
What 's more , you do n't need such a martyr 's cross when you are not ready for it . 
If you had murdered our father , it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment . 
But you are innocent , and such a cross is too much for you . 
You wanted to make yourself another man by suffering . 
I say , only remember that other man always , all your life and wherever you go ; and that will be enough for you . 
Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your life even greater duty , and that constant feeling will do more to make you a new man , perhaps , than if you went there . 
For there you would not endure it and would repine , and perhaps at last would say : ' I am quits . ' 
The lawyer was right about that .
