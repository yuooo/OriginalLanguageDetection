`` But I could n't tell that he would come with a bad finger , or else perhaps I might have done it on purpose . 
My darling mamma , you begin to say really witty things . '' 
`` Never mind my being witty , but I must say you show nice feeling for Alexey Fyodorovitch 's sufferings ! 
Oh , my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , what 's killing me is no one thing in particular , not Herzenstube , but everything together , that 's what is too much for me . '' 
`` That 's enough , mamma , enough about Herzenstube , '' Lise laughed gaily . 
`` Make haste with the lint and the lotion , mamma . 
That 's simply Goulard 's water , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I remember the name now , but it 's a splendid lotion . 
Would you believe it , Mamma , on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street , and it was a boy bit his finger , is n't he a child , a child himself ? 
Is he fit to be married after that ? 
For only fancy , he wants to be married , mamma . 
Just think of him married , would n't it be funny , would n't it be awful ? '' 
And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle , looking slyly at Alyosha . 
`` But why married , Lise ? 
What makes you talk of such a thing ? 
It 's quite out of place and perhaps the boy was rabid . '' 
`` Why , mamma ! 
As though there were rabid boys ! '' 
`` Why not , Lise , as though I had said something stupid ! 
Your boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite anyone near him . 
How well she has bandaged it , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
I could n't have done it . 
Do you still feel the pain ? '' 
`` It 's nothing much now . '' 
`` You do n't feel afraid of water ? '' 
asked Lise . 
`` Come , that 's enough , Lise , perhaps I really was rather too quick talking of the boy being rabid , and you pounced upon it at once . 
Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here , Alexey Fyodorovitch , she simply rushed at me , she 's dying to see you , dying ! '' 
`` Ach , mamma , go to them yourself . 
He ca n't go just now , he is in too much pain . '' 
`` Not at all , I can go quite well , '' said Alyosha . 
`` What ! 
You are going away ? 
Is that what you say ? '' 
`` Well , when I 've seen them , I 'll come back here and we can talk as much as you like . 
But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once , for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can . '' 
`` Mamma , take him away quickly . 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , do n't trouble to come and see me afterwards , but go straight back to your monastery and a good riddance . 
I want to sleep , I did n't sleep all night . '' 
`` Ah , Lise , you are only making fun , but how I wish you would sleep ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
`` I do n't know what I 've done ... . 
I 'll stay another three minutes , five if you like , '' muttered Alyosha . 
`` Even five ! 
Do take him away quickly , mamma , he is a monster . '' 
`` Lise , you are crazy . 
Let us go , Alexey Fyodorovitch , she is too capricious to-day . 
I am afraid to cross her . 
Oh , the trouble one has with nervous girls ! 
Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you . 
How quickly you have made her sleepy , and how fortunate it is ! ''
