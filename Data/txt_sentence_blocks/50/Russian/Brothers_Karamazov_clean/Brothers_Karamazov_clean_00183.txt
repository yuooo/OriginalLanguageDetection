`` As to yesterday , I believe you , but as for to-day , it is difficult to agree with your opinion , '' said he . 
`` Bravo , '' I cried , clapping my hands . 
`` I agree with you there too , I have deserved it ! '' 
`` Will you shoot , sir , or not ? '' 
`` No , I wo n't , '' I said ; `` if you like , fire at me again , but it would be better for you not to fire . '' 
The seconds , especially mine , were shouting too : `` Can you disgrace the regiment like this , facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness ! 
If I 'd only known this ! '' 
I stood facing them all , not laughing now . 
`` Gentlemen , '' I said , `` is it really so wonderful in these days to find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing ? '' 
`` But not in a duel , '' cried my second again . 
`` That 's what 's so strange , '' I said . 
`` For I ought to have owned my fault as soon as I got here , before he had fired a shot , before leading him into a great and deadly sin ; but we have made our life so grotesque , that to act in that way would have been almost impossible , for only after I had faced his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any significance for him , and if I had spoken before , he would have said , ` He is a coward , the sight of the pistols has frightened him , no use to listen to him . ' 
Gentlemen , '' I cried suddenly , speaking straight from my heart , `` look around you at the gifts of God , the clear sky , the pure air , the tender grass , the birds ; nature is beautiful and sinless , and we , only we , are sinful and foolish , and we do n't understand that life is heaven , for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty , we shall embrace each other and weep . '' 
I would have said more but I could not ; my voice broke with the sweetness and youthful gladness of it , and there was such bliss in my heart as I had never known before in my life . 
`` All this is rational and edifying , '' said my antagonist , `` and in any case you are an original person . '' 
`` You may laugh , '' I said to him , laughing too , `` but afterwards you will approve of me . '' 
`` Oh , I am ready to approve of you now , '' said he ; `` will you shake hands ? 
for I believe you are genuinely sincere . '' 
`` No , '' I said , `` not now , later on when I have grown worthier and deserve your esteem , then shake hands and you will do well . '' 
We went home , my second upbraiding me all the way , while I kissed him . 
All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day . 
`` He has disgraced the uniform , '' they said ; `` Let him resign his commission . '' 
Some stood up for me : `` He faced the shot , '' they said . 
`` Yes , but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness . '' 
`` If he had been afraid of being shot , he would have shot his own pistol first before asking forgiveness , while he flung it loaded into the forest . 
No , there 's something else in this , something original . '' 
I enjoyed listening and looking at them . 
`` My dear friends and comrades , '' said I , `` do n't worry about my resigning my commission , for I have done so already . 
I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery - it 's with that object I am leaving the regiment . '' 
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing . 
`` You should have told us of that first , that explains everything , we ca n't judge a monk . '' 
They laughed and could not stop themselves , and not scornfully , but kindly and merrily . 
They all felt friendly to me at once , even those who had been sternest in their censure , and all the following month , before my discharge came , they could not make enough of me . 
`` Ah , you monk , '' they would say . 
And everyone said something kind to me , they began trying to dissuade me , even to pity me : `` What are you doing to yourself ? '' 
`` No , '' they would say , `` he is a brave fellow , he faced fire and could have fired his own pistol too , but he had a dream the night before that he should become a monk , that 's why he did it . '' 
It was the same thing with the society of the town . 
Till then I had been kindly received , but had not been the object of special attention , and now all came to know me at once and invited me ; they laughed at me , but they loved me . 
I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel , the authorities took no notice of it , because my antagonist was a near relation of our general , and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences , and as I resigned my commission , they took it as a joke . 
And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly , regardless of their laughter , for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter . 
These conversations mostly took place in the evenings , in the company of ladies ; women particularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen . 
`` But how can I possibly be responsible for all ? '' 
everyone would laugh in my face . 
`` Can I , for instance , be responsible for you ? '' 
`` You may well not know it , '' I would answer , `` since the whole world has long been going on a different line , since we consider the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others . 
Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and , well , you all look upon me as a madman . 
Though you are friendly to me , yet , you see , you all laugh at me . '' 
`` But how can we help being friendly to you ? '' 
said my hostess , laughing . 
The room was full of people .
