`` How do you mean , offering herself ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` As wanton women offer themselves , to be sure . '' 
`` How can you , Ivan , how can you ? '' 
Alyosha cried warmly , in a grieved voice . 
`` She is a child ; you are insulting a child ! 
She is ill ; she is very ill , too . 
She is on the verge of insanity , too , perhaps ... . 
I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would save her . '' 
`` You 'll hear nothing from me . 
If she is a child , I am not her nurse . 
Be quiet , Alexey . 
Do n't go on about her . 
I am not even thinking about it . '' 
They were silent again for a moment . 
`` She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to act to-morrow at the trial , '' he said sharply and angrily again . 
`` You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Whether she 's to save Mitya or ruin him . 
She 'll pray for light from above . 
She ca n't make up her mind for herself , you see . 
She has not had time to decide yet . 
She takes me for her nurse , too . 
She wants me to sing lullabies to her . '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna loves you , brother , '' said Alyosha sadly . 
`` Perhaps ; but I am not very keen on her . '' 
`` She is suffering . 
Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give her hope ? '' 
Alyosha went on , with timid reproach . 
`` I know that you 've given her hope . 
Forgive me for speaking to you like this , '' he added . 
`` I ca n't behave to her as I ought - break off altogether and tell her so straight out , '' said Ivan , irritably . 
`` I must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer . 
If I break off with her now , she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial , for she hates him and knows she hates him . 
It 's all a lie - lie upon lie ! 
As long as I do n't break off with her , she goes on hoping , and she wo n't ruin that monster , knowing how I want to get him out of trouble . 
If only that damned verdict would come ! '' 
The words `` murderer '' and `` monster '' echoed painfully in Alyosha 's heart . 
`` But how can she ruin Mitya ? '' 
he asked , pondering on Ivan 's words . 
`` What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya ? '' 
`` You do n't know that yet . 
She 's got a document in her hands , in Mitya 's own writing , that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor Pavlovitch . '' 
`` That 's impossible ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Why is it impossible ? 
I 've read it myself . '' 
`` There ca n't be such a document ! '' 
Alyosha repeated warmly . 
`` There ca n't be , because he 's not the murderer .
