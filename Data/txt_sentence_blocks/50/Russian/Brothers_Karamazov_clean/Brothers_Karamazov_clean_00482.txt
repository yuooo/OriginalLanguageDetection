`` I 'll come to you again at nightfall , '' said Alyosha , and he ran after Katya . 
He overtook her outside the hospital grounds . 
She walking fast , but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly : `` No , before that woman I ca n't punish myself ! 
I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end . 
She would not forgive me ... . 
I like her for that ! '' 
she added , in an unnatural voice , and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment . 
`` My brother did not expect this in the least , '' muttered Alyosha . 
`` He was sure she would not come - '' `` No doubt . 
Let us leave that , '' she snapped . 
`` Listen : I ca n't go with you to the funeral now . 
I 've sent them flowers . 
I think they still have money . 
If necessary , tell them I 'll never abandon them ... . 
Now leave me , leave me , please . 
You are late as it is - the bells are ringing for the service ... . 
Leave me , please ! '' 
Ilusha 's Funeral . 
The Speech at the Stone HE really was late . 
They had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him . 
It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha . 
He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced . 
At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys , Ilusha 's schoolfellows . 
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last . 
There were about twelve of them , they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders . 
`` Father will cry , be with father , '' Ilusha had told them as he lay dying , and the boys remembered it . 
Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them . 
`` How glad I am you 've come , Karamazov ! '' 
he cried , holding out his hand to Alyosha . 
`` It 's awful here . 
It 's really horrible to see it . 
Snegiryov is not drunk , we know for a fact he 's had nothing to drink to-day , but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly , but this is awful . 
Karamazov , if I am not keeping you , one question before you go in ? '' 
`` What is it , Kolya ? '' 
said Alyosha . 
`` Is your brother innocent or guilty ? 
Was it he killed your father or was it the valet ? 
As you say , so it will be . 
I have n't slept for the last four nights for thinking of it . '' 
`` The valet killed him , my brother is innocent , '' answered Alyosha . 
`` That 's what I said , '' cried Smurov . 
`` So he will perish an innocent victim ! '' 
exclaimed Kolya ; `` though he is ruined he is happy ! 
I could envy him ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? 
How can you ? 
Why ? '' 
cried Alyosha surprised . 
`` Oh , if I , too , could sacrifice myself some day for truth ! '' 
said Kolya with enthusiasm .
