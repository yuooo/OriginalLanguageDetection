If I want to do a thing I do it . 
I may have made you some promise just now . 
But now again I 'm thinking : I may take Mitya again . 
I liked him very much once - liked him for almost a whole hour . 
Now maybe I shall go and tell him to stay with me from this day forward . 
You see , I 'm so changeable . '' 
`` Just now you said - something quite different , '' Katerina Ivanovna whispered faintly . 
`` Ah , just now ! 
But , you know , I 'm such a soft-hearted , silly creature . 
Only think what he 's gone through on my account ! 
What if when I go home I feel sorry for him ? 
What then ? '' 
`` I never expected - '' `` Ah , young lady , how good and generous you are compared with me ! 
Now perhaps you wo n't care for a silly creature like me , now you know my character . 
Give me your sweet little hand , angelic lady , '' she said tenderly , and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna 's hand . 
`` Here , dear young lady , I 'll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine . 
You kissed mine three times , but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times to be even with you . 
Well , but let that pass . 
And then it shall be as God wills . 
Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave . 
Let it be as God wills , without any agreements and promises . 
What a sweet hand - what a sweet hand you have ! 
You sweet young lady , you incredible beauty ! '' 
She slowly raised the hands to her lips , with the strange object indeed of `` being even '' with her in kisses . 
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away . 
She listened with timid hope to the last words , though Grushenka 's promise to do her bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed . 
She looked intently into her eyes ; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted , confiding expression , the same bright gaiety . 
`` She 's perhaps too naive , '' thought Katerina Ivanovna , with a gleam of hope . 
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the `` sweet hand . '' 
She raised it deliberately to her lips . 
But she held it for two or three minutes near her lips , as though reconsidering something . 
`` Do you know , angel lady , '' she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice , `` do you know , after all , I think I wo n't kiss your hand ? '' 
And she laughed a little merry laugh . 
`` As you please . 
What 's the matter with you ? '' 
said Katerina Ivanovna , starting suddenly . 
`` So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand , but I did n't kiss yours . '' 
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes . 
She looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Insolent creature ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , as though suddenly grasping something . 
She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat . 
Grushenka too got up , but without haste . 
`` So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand , but I did n't kiss yours at all . 
And how he will laugh ! '' 
`` Vile slut ! 
Go away ! '' 
`` Ah , for shame , young lady ! 
Ah , for shame ! 
That 's unbecoming for you , dear young lady , a word like that . ''
