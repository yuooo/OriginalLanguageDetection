`` Look alive , Marya , or you 'll get the stick ! 
The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion , amid roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women . 
`` Well , let them ! 
Let them ! '' 
said Grushenka sententiously , with an ecstatic expression on her face . 
`` When they do get a day to enjoy themselves ; why should n't folks be happy ? '' 
Kalgonov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt . 
`` It 's swinish , all this peasant foolery , '' he murmured , moving away ; `` it 's the game they play when it 's light all night in summer . '' 
He particularly disliked one `` new '' song to a jaunty dance-tune . 
It described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls , to see whether they would love him : The master came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But the girls could not love the master : He would beat me cruelly And such love wo n't do for me . 
Then a gypsy comes along and he , too , tries : The gypsy came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But they could n't love the gypsy either : He would be a thief , I fear , And would cause me many a tear . 
And many more men come to try their luck , among them a soldier : The soldier came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But the soldier is rejected with contempt , in two indecent lines , sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience . 
The song ends with a merchant : The merchant came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
And it appears that he wins their love because : The merchant will make gold for me And his queen I 'll gladly be . 
Kalgonov was positively indignant . 
`` That 's just a song of yesterday , '' he said aloud . 
`` Who writes such things for them ? 
They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to try his luck with the girls ; they 'd have carried all before them . '' 
And , almost as though it were a personal affront , he declared , on the spot , that he was bored , sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep . 
His pretty little face looked rather pale , as it fell back on the sofa cushion . 
`` Look how pretty he is , '' said Grushenka , taking Mitya up to him . 
`` I was combing his hair just now ; his hair 's like flax , and so thick ... '' And , bending over him tenderly , she kissed his forehead . 
Kalgonov instantly opened his eyes , looked at her , stood up , and with the most anxious air inquired where was Maximov ? 
`` So that 's who it is you want . '' 
Grushenka laughed . 
`` Stay with me a minute . 
Mitya , run and find his Maximov . '' 
Maximov , it appeared , could not tear himself away from the girls , only running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur . 
He had drunk two cups of chocolate . 
His face was red , and his nose was crimson ; his eyes were moist , and mawkishly sweet.He ran up and announced that he was going to dance the `` sabotiere . '' 
`` They taught me all those well-bred , aristocratic dances when I was little ... '' `` Go , go with him , Mitya , and I 'll watch from here how he dances , '' said Grushenka . 
`` No , no , I 'm coming to look on , too , '' exclaimed Kalganov , brushing aside in the most naive way Grushenka 's offer to sit with him . 
They all went to look on . 
Maximov danced his dance . 
But it roused no great admiration in anyone but Mitya . 
It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping , kicking the feet , and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot . 
Kalgonov did not like it at all , but Mitya kissed the dancer . 
`` Thanks . 
You 're tired perhaps ? 
What are you looking for here ? 
Would you like some sweets ? 
A cigar , perhaps ? '' 
`` A cigarette . '' 
`` Do n't you want a drink ? '' 
`` I 'll just have a liqueur ... . 
Have you any chocolates ? '' 
`` Yes , there 's a heap of them on the table there .
