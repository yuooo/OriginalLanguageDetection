`` Go away ! 
You 're a creature for sale '' screamed Katerina Ivanovna . 
Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face . 
`` For sale indeed ! 
You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once ; you brought your beauty for sale . 
You see , I know . '' 
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked , and would have rushed at her , but Alyosha held her with all his strength . 
`` Not a step , not a word ! 
Do n't speak , do n't answer her . 
She 'll go away - she 'll go at once . '' 
At that instant Katerina Ivanovna 's two aunts ran in at her cry , and with them a maid-servant . 
All hurried to her . 
`` I will go away , '' said Grushenka , taking up her mantle from the sofa . 
`` Alyosha , darling , see me home ! '' 
`` Go away - go away , make haste ! '' 
cried Alyosha , clasping his hands imploringly . 
`` Dear little Alyosha , see me home ! 
I 've got a pretty little story to tell you on the way . 
I got up this scene for your benefit , Alyosha . 
See me home , dear , you 'll be glad of it afterwards . '' 
Alyosha turned away , wringing his hands . 
Grushenka ran out of the house , laughing musically . 
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics . 
She sobbed , and was shaken with convulsions . 
Everyone fussed round her . 
`` I warned you , '' said the elder of her aunts . 
`` I tried to prevent your doing this . 
You 're too impulsive . 
How could you do such a thing ? 
You do n't know these creatures , and they say she 's worse than any of them . 
You are too self-willed . '' 
`` She 's a tigress ! '' 
yelled Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Why did you hold me , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? 
I 'd have beaten her - beaten her ! '' 
She could not control herself before Alyosha ; perhaps she did not care to , indeed . 
`` She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold ! '' 
Alyosha withdrew towards the door . 
`` But , my God ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , clasping her hands . 
`` He ! 
He ! 
He could be so dishonourable , so inhuman ! 
Why , he told that creature what happened on that fatal , accursed day ! 
` You brought your beauty for sale , dear young lady . ' 
She knows it ! 
Your brother 's a scoundrel , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
Alyosha wanted to say something , but he could n't find a word . 
His heart ached . 
`` Go away , Alexey Fyodorovitch !
