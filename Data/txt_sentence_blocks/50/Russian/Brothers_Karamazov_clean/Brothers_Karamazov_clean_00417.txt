`` That anecdote about the quadrillion years , I made up myself ! 
I was seventeen then , I was at the high school . 
I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin , it was at Moscow ... . 
The anecdote is so characteristic that I could n't have taken it from anywhere . 
I thought I 'd forgotten it ... but I 've unconsciously recalled it - I recalled it myself - it was not you telling it ! 
Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that even when people are being taken to execution ... it 's come back to me in a dream . 
You are that dream ! 
You are a dream , not a living creature ! '' 
`` From the vehemence with which you deny my existence , '' laughed the gentleman , `` I am convinced that you believe in me . '' 
`` Not in the slightest ! 
I have n't a hundredth part of a grain of faith in you ! '' 
`` But you have the thousandth of a grain . 
Homeopathic doses perhaps are the strongest . 
Confess that you have faith even to the ten-thousandth of a grain . '' 
`` Not for one minute , '' cried Ivan furiously . 
`` But I should like to believe in you , '' he added strangely . 
`` Aha ! 
There 's an admission ! 
But I am good-natured . 
I 'll come to your assistance again . 
Listen , it was I caught you , not you me . 
I told you your anecdote you 'd forgotten , on purpose , so as to destroy your faith in me completely . '' 
`` You are lying . 
The object of your visit is to convince me of your existence ! '' 
`` Just so . 
But hesitation , suspense , conflict between belief and disbelief - is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man , such as you are , that it 's better to hang oneself at once . 
Knowing that you are inclined to believe in me , I administered some disbelief by telling you that anecdote . 
I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns , and I have my motive in it . 
It 's the new method . 
As soon as you disbelieve in me completely , you 'll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but a reality . 
I know you . 
Then I shall have attained my object , which is an honourable one . 
I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree - and such an oak-tree that , sitting on it , you will long to enter the ranks of ` the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women , ' for that is what you are secretly longing for . 
You 'll dine on locusts , you 'll wander into the wilderness to save your soul ! '' 
`` Then it 's for the salvation of my soul you are working , is it , you scoundrel ? '' 
`` One must do a good work sometimes . 
How ill-humoured you are ! '' 
`` Fool ! 
did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss ? '' 
`` My dear fellow , I 've done nothing else . 
One forgets the whole world and all the worlds , and sticks to one such saint , because he is a very precious diamond . 
One such soul , you know , is sometimes worth a whole constellation . 
We have our system of reckoning , you know . 
The conquest is priceless ! 
And some of them , on my word , are not inferior to you in culture , though you wo n't believe it . 
They can contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair 's - breadth of being ` turned upside down , ' as the actor Gorbunov says . '' 
`` Well , did you get your nose pulled ? '' 
`` My dear fellow , '' observed the visitor sententiously , `` it 's better to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all . 
As an afflicted marquis observed not long ago -LRB- he must have been treated by a specialist -RRB- in confession to his spiritual father - a Jesuit . 
I was present , it was simply charming .
