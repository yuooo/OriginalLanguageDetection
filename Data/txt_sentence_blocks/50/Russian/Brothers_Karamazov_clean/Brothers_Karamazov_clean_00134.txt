It 's just then that I 'll appear . 
` Here , you are a proud man , ' I shall say : ` you have shown it ; but now take the money and forgive us ! ' 
And then he will take it ! 
Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words , `` And then he will take it ! '' 
Lise clapped her hands . 
`` Ah , that 's true ! 
I understand that perfectly now . 
Ah , Alyosha , how do you know all this ? 
So young and yet he knows what 's in the heart ... . 
I should never have worked it out . '' 
`` The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing with us , in spite of his taking money from us , '' Alyosha went on in his excitement , `` and not only on an equal , but even on a higher footing . '' '' 
` On a higher footing ' is charming , Alexey Fyodorovitch ; but go on , go on ! '' 
`` You mean there is n't such an expression as ` on a higher footing ' ; but that does n't matter because - '' `` Oh , no , of course it does n't matter . 
Forgive me , Alyosha , dear ... . 
You know , I scarcely respected you till now - that is I respected you but on an equal footing ; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing . 
Do n't be angry , dear , at my joking , '' she put in at once , with strong feeling . 
`` I am absurd and small , but you , you ! 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
Is n't there in all our analysis - I mean your analysis ... no , better call it ours - are n't we showing contempt for him , for that poor man - in analysing his soul like this , as it were , from above , eh ? 
In deciding so certainly that he will take the money ? '' 
`` No , Lise , it 's not contempt , '' Alyosha answered , as though he had prepared himself for the question . 
`` I was thinking of that on the way here . 
How can it be contempt when we are all like him , when we are all just the same as he is ? 
For you know we are just the same , no better . 
If we are better , we should have been just the same in his place ... . 
I do n't know about you , Lise , but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways , and his soul is not sordid ; on the contrary , full of fine feeling ... . 
No , Lise , I have no contempt for him . 
Do you know , Lise , my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for children , and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
dear , let us care for people as we would for the sick ! '' 
`` Let us , Lise ; I am ready . 
Though I am not altogether ready in myself . 
I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I do n't see things . 
It 's different with you . '' 
`` Ah , I do n't believe it ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , how happy I am ! '' 
`` I am so glad you say so , Lise . '' 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , you are wonderfully good , but you are sometimes sort of formal ... . 
And yet you are not a bit formal really . 
Go to the door , open it gently , and see whether mamma is listening , '' said Lise , in a nervous , hurried whisper . 
Alyosha went , opened the door , and reported that no one was listening . 
`` Come here , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' Lise went on , flushing redder and redder . 
`` Give me your hand - that 's right . 
I have to make a great confession . 
I did n't write to you yesterday in joke , but in earnest , '' and she hid her eyes with her hand . 
It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession . 
Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times . 
`` Ah , Lise , what a good thing ! '' 
cried Alyosha joyfully . 
`` You know , I was perfectly sure you were in earnest . ''
