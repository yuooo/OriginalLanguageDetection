An acquittal , they thought , was inevitable . 
They all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm . 
I must own there were many among the men , too , who were convinced that an acquittal was inevitable . 
Some were pleased , others frowned , while some were simply dejected , not wanting him to be acquitted . 
Fetyukovitch himself was confident of his success . 
He was surrounded by people congratulating him and fawning upon him . 
`` There are , '' he said to one group , as I was told afterwards , `` there are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defence with the jury . 
One feels during one 's speech if they are being formed . 
I was aware of them . 
They exist . 
Our cause is won . 
Set your mind at rest . '' 
`` What will our peasants say now ? '' 
said one stout , cross-looking , pock-marked gentleman , a landowner of the neighbourhood , approaching a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation . 
`` But they are not all peasants . 
There are four government clerks among them . '' 
`` Yes , there are clerks , '' said a member of the district council , joining the group . 
`` And do you know that Nazaryev , the merchant with the medal , a juryman ? '' 
`` What of him ? '' 
`` He is a man with brains . '' 
`` But he never speaks . '' 
`` He is no great talker , but so much the better . 
There 's no need for the Petersburg man to teach him : he could teach all Petersburg himself . 
He 's the father of twelve children . 
Think of that ! '' 
`` Upon my word , you do n't suppose they wo n't acquit him ? '' 
one of our young officials exclaimed in another group . 
`` They 'll acquit him for certain , '' said a resolute voice . 
`` It would be shameful , disgraceful , not to acquit him cried the official . 
`` Suppose he did murder him - there are fathers and fathers ! 
And , besides , he was in such a frenzy ... . 
He really may have done nothing but swing the pestle in the air , and so knocked the old man down . 
But it was a pity they dragged the valet in . 
That was simply an absurd theory ! 
If I 'd been in Fetyukovitch 's place , I should simply have said straight out : ` He murdered him ; but he is not guilty , hang it all ! ' 
`` That 's what he did , only without saying , ` Hang it all ! ' '' 
`` No , Mihail Semyonovitch , he almost said that , too , '' put in a third voice . 
`` Why , gentlemen , in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut the throat of her lover 's lawful wife . '' 
`` Oh , but she did not finish cutting it . '' 
`` That makes no difference . 
She began cutting it . '' 
`` What did you think of what he said about children ? 
Splendid , was n't it ? '' 
`` Splended ! '' 
`` And about mysticism , too ! '' 
`` Oh , drop mysticism , do ! '' 
cried someone else ; `` think of Ippolit and his fate from this day forth . 
His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow for Mitya 's sake . '' 
`` Is she here ? '' 
`` What an idea !
