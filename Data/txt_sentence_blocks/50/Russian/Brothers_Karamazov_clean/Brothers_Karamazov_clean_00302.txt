`` No , no , c'est fini , do n't trouble yourselves . 
It 's not worth while soiling one 's hands . 
I have soiled myself enough through you as it is . 
You 're not worth it - no one is . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I 'm not going on . '' 
This was said too peremptorily . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist further , but from Ippolit Kirillovitch 's eyes he saw that he had not given up hope . 
`` Can you not , at least , tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into Mr. Perhotin 's - how many roubles exactly ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that . '' 
`` You spoke to Mr. Perhotin , I believe , of having received three thousand from Madame Hohlakov . '' 
`` Perhaps I did . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I wo n't say how much I had . '' 
`` Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you have done since you arrived ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you might ask the people here about that . 
But I 'll tell you if you like . '' 
He proceeded to do so , but we wo n't repeat his story . 
He told it dryly and curtly . 
Of the raptures of his love he said nothing , but told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself , owing to `` new factors in the case . '' 
He told the story without going into motives or details . 
And this time the lawyers did not worry him much . 
It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here . 
`` We shall verify all that . 
We will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses , which will , of course , take place in your presence , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion . 
`` And now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession , especially all the money you still have about you . '' 
`` My money , gentlemen ? 
Certainly . 
I understand that that is necessary . 
I 'm surprised , indeed , that you have n't inquired about it before . 
It 's true I could n't get away anywhere . 
I 'm sitting here where I can be seen . 
But here 's my money - count it - take it . 
That 's all , I think . '' 
He turned it all out of his pockets ; even the small change - two pieces of twenty copecks - he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket . 
They counted the money , which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles , and forty copecks . 
`` And is that all ? '' 
asked the investigating lawyer . 
`` You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at Plotnikovs ' . 
You gave Perhotin ten , your driver twenty , here you lost two hundred , then ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up . 
Mitya helped him readily . 
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total . 
`` With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first ? '' 
`` I suppose so , '' snapped Mitya . 
`` How is it they all assert there was much more ? '' 
`` Let them assert it . '' 
`` But you asserted it yourself . '' 
`` Yes , I did , too . ''
