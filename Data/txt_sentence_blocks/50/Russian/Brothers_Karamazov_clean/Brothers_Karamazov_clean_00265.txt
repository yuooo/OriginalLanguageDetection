shouted Mitya furiously . 
`` You 've lost two hundred , panie . 
Will you stake another hundred ? '' 
the Pole on the sofa inquired . 
`` What ? 
Lost two hundred already ? 
Then another two hundred ! 
All doubles ! '' 
And pulling his money out of his pocket , Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen , but Kalgonov covered it with his hand . 
`` That 's enough ! '' 
he shouted in his ringing voice . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
Mitya stared at him . 
`` That 's enough ! 
I do n't want you to play anymore . 
Do n't ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because I do n't . 
Hang it , come away . 
That 's why . 
I wo n't let you go on playing . '' 
Mitya gazed at him in astonishment . 
`` Give it up , Mitya . 
He may be right . 
You 've lost a lot as it is , '' said Grushenka , with a curious note in her voice . 
Both the Poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air . 
`` Are you joking , panie ? '' 
said the short man , looking severely at Kalganov . 
`` How dare you ! '' 
Pan Vrublevsky , too , growled at Kalganov . 
`` Do n't dare to shout like that , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` Ah , you turkey-cocks ! '' 
Mitya looked at each of them in turn . 
But something in Grushenka 's face suddenly struck him , and at the same instant something new flashed into his mind - a strange new thought ! 
`` Pani Agrippina , '' the little Pole was beginning , crimson with anger , when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder . 
`` Most illustrious , two words with you . 
`` cried Grushenka . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
`` In the next room , I 've two words to say to you , something pleasant , very pleasant . 
You 'll be glad to hear it . '' 
The little pan was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya . 
He agreed at once , however , on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them . 
`` The bodyguard ? 
Let him come , and I want him , too . 
I must have him ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` March , panovie ! '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
asked Grushenka , anxiously . 
`` We 'll be back in one moment , '' answered Mitya .
