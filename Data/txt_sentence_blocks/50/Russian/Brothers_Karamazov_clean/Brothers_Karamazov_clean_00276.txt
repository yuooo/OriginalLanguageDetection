At last she announced that she was going to dance , too . 
She got up from her chair , staggering . 
`` Mitya , do n't give me any more wine - if I ask you , do n't give it to me . 
Wine does n't give peace . 
Everything 's going round , the stove , and everything . 
I want to dance . 
Let everyone see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I dance ... '' She really meant it . 
She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her pocket , and took it by one corner in her right hand , to wave it in the dance . 
Mitya ran to and fro , the girls were quiet , and got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal . 
Maximov , hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance , squealed with delight , and ran skipping about in front of her , humming : With legs so slim and sides so trim And its little tail curled tight . 
But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away . 
`` Sh-h ! 
Mitya , why do n't they come ? 
Let everyone come ... to look on . 
Call them in , too , that were locked in ... . 
Why did you lock them in ? 
Tell them I 'm going to dance . 
Let them look on , too ... '' Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door , and began knocking to the Poles with his fist . 
`` Hi , you ... Podvysotskis ! 
Come , she 's going to dance . 
She calls you . '' 
`` Lajdak ! '' 
one of the Poles shouted in reply . 
`` You 're a lajdak yourself ! 
You 're a little scoundrel , that 's what you are . '' 
`` Leave off laughing at Poland , '' said Kalganov sententiously . 
He too was drunk . 
`` Be quiet , boy ! 
If I call him a scoundrel , it does n't mean that I called all Poland so . 
One lajdak does n't make a Poland . 
Be quiet , my pretty boy , eat a sweetmeat . '' 
`` Ach , what fellows ! 
As though they were not men . 
Why wo n't they make friends ? '' 
said Grushenka , and went forward to dance . 
The chorus broke into `` Ah , my porch , my new porch ! '' 
Grushenka flung back her head , half opened her lips , smiled , waved her handkerchief , and suddenly , with a violent lurch , stood still in the middle of the room , looking bewildered . 
`` I 'm weak ... '' she said in an exhausted voice . 
`` Forgive me ... . 
I 'm weak , I ca n't ... . 
I 'm sorry . '' 
She bowed to the chorus , and then began bowing in all directions . 
`` I 'm sorry ... . 
Forgive me ... '' `` The lady 's been drinking . 
The pretty lady has been drinking , '' voices were heard saying . 
`` The lady 's drunk too much , '' Maximov explained to the girls , giggling . 
`` Mitya , lead me away ... take me , '' said Grushenka helplessly . 
Mitya pounced on her , snatched her up in his arms , and carried the precious burden through the curtains . 
`` Well , now I 'll go , '' thought Kalganov , and walking out of the blue room , he closed the two halves of the door after him . 
But the orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder .
