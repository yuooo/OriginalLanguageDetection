Perhaps that 's me , Yorick ? 
Yes , I 'm Yorick now , and a skull afterwards . '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence . 
Mitya , too , was silent for a while . 
`` What dog 's that you 've got here ? '' 
he asked the shopman , casually , noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes , sitting in the corner . 
`` It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna , the mistress , '' answered the clerk . 
`` She brought it and forgot it here . 
It must be taken back to her . '' 
`` I saw one like it ... in the regiment ... '' murmured Mitya dreamily , `` only that one had its hind leg broken ... . 
By the way , Pyotr Ilyitch , I wanted to ask you : have you ever stolen anything in your life ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` Oh , I did n't mean anything . 
From somebody 's pocket , you know . 
I do n't mean government money , everyone steals that , and no doubt you do , too ... '' `` You go to the devil . '' 
`` I 'm talking of other people 's money . 
Stealing straight out of a pocket ? 
Out of a purse , eh ? '' 
`` I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old . 
I took it off the table on the sly , and held it tight in my hand . '' 
`` Well , and what happened ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing . 
I kept it three days , then I felt ashamed , confessed , and gave it back . '' 
`` And what then ? '' 
`` Naturally I was whipped . 
But why do you ask ? 
Have you stolen something ? '' 
`` I have , '' said Mitya , winking slyly . 
`` What have you stolen ? '' 
inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously . 
`` I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old , and gave it back three days after . '' 
As he said this , Mitya suddenly got up . 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , wo n't you come now ? '' 
called Andrey from the door of the shop . 
`` Are you ready ? 
We 'll come ! '' 
Mitya started . 
`` A few more last words and - Andrey , a glass of vodka at starting . 
Give him some brandy as well ! 
That box '' -LRB- the one with the pistols -RRB- `` put under my seat . 
Good-bye , Pyotr Ilyitch , do n't remember evil against me . '' 
`` But you 're coming back to-morrow ? '' 
`` Will you settle the little bill now ? '' 
cried the clerk , springing forward . 
`` Oh yes , the bill . 
Of course . '' 
He pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again , picked out three hundred roubles , threw them on the counter , and ran hurriedly out of the shop . 
Everyone followed him out , bowing and wishing him good luck . 
Andrey , coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed , jumped up on the box . 
But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him .
