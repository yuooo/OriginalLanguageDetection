`` How was it you came just now , eh ? 
Have you walked in ! 
... I was frightened . 
So you wanted to give me up to him , did you ? 
Did you really want to ? '' 
`` I did n't want to spoil your happiness ! '' 
Mitya faltered blissfully . 
But she did not need his answer . 
`` Well , go and enjoy yourself ... '' she sent him away once more . 
`` Do n't cry , I 'll call you back again . '' 
He would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at the dancing , though her eyes followed him wherever he went . 
But in another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run back to her . 
`` Come , sit beside me , tell me , how did you hear about me , and my coming here yesterday ? 
From whom did you first hear it ? '' 
And Mitya began telling her all about it , disconnectedly , incoherently , feverishly . 
He spoke strangely , often frowning , and stopping abruptly . 
`` What are you frowning at ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Nothing ... . 
I left a man ill there . 
I 'd give ten years of my life for him to get well , to know he was all right ! '' 
`` Well , never mind him , if he 's ill . 
So you meant to shoot yourself to-morrow ! 
What a silly boy ! 
What for ? 
I like such reckless fellows as you , '' she lisped , with a rather halting tongue . 
`` So you would go any length for me , eh ? 
Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow , you stupid ? 
No , wait a little . 
To-morrow I may have something to say to you ... . 
I wo n't say it to-day , but to-morrow . 
You 'd like it to be to-day ? 
No , I do n't want to to-day . 
Come , go along now , go and amuse yourself . '' 
Once , however , she called him , as it were , puzzled and uneasy . 
`` Why are you sad ? 
I see you 're sad ... . 
Yes , I see it , '' she added , looking intently into his eyes . 
`` Though you keep kissing the peasants and shouting , I see something . 
No , be merry . 
I 'm merry ; you be merry , too ... . 
I love somebody here . 
Guess who it is . 
Ah , look , my boy has fallen asleep , poor dear , he 's drunk . '' 
She meant Kalganov . 
He was , in fact , drunk , and had dropped asleep for a moment , sitting on the sofa . 
But he was not merely drowsy from drink ; he felt suddenly dejected , or , as he said , `` bored . '' 
He was intensely depressed by the girls ' songs , which , as the drinking went on , gradually became coarse and more reckless . 
And the dances were as bad . 
Two girls dressed up as bears , and a lively girl , called Stepanida , with a stick in her hand , acted the part of keeper , and began to `` show them . ''
