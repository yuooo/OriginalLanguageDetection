`` There has been a change , '' Grushenka assented quickly . 
`` They have a secret , they have a secret ! 
Mitya told me himself there was a secret , and such a secret that Mitya ca n't rest . 
Before then , he was cheerful - and , indeed , he is cheerful now - but when he shakes his head like that , you know , and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand , I know there is something on his mind worrying him ... . 
I know ! 
He was cheerful before , though , indeed , he is cheerful to-day . '' 
`` But you said he was worried . '' 
`` Yes , he is worried and yet cheerful . 
He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again . 
And you know , Alyosha , I am constantly wondering at him - with this awful thing hanging over him , he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself . '' 
`` And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan ? 
Did he say , ` Do n't tell him ' ? '' 
`` Yes , he told me , ` Do n't tell him . ' 
It 's you that Mitya 's most afraid of . 
Because it 's a secret : he said himself it was a secret . 
Alyosha , darling , go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me , '' Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness . 
`` Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that 's in store for me . 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
`` You think it 's something to do with you ? 
If it were , he would n't have told you there was a secret . '' 
`` I do n't know . 
Perhaps he wants to tell me , but does n't dare to . 
He warns me . 
There is a secret , he tells me , but he wo n't tell me what it is . '' 
`` What do you think yourself ? '' 
`` What do I think ? 
It 's the end for me , that 's what I think . 
They all three have been plotting my end , for Katerina 's in it . 
It 's all Katerina , it all comes from her . 
She is this and that , and that means that I am not . 
He tells me that beforehand - warns me . 
He is planning to throw me over , that 's the whole secret . 
They 've planned it together , the three of them - Mitya , Katerina , and Ivan Fyodorovitch . 
Alyosha , I 've been wanting to ask you a long time . 
A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina , because he often goes to see her . 
Did he tell me the truth or not ? 
Tell me , on your conscience , tell me the worst . '' 
`` I wo n't tell you a lie . 
Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna , I think . '' 
`` Oh , that 's what I thought ! 
He is lying to me , shameless deceiver , that 's what it is ! 
And he was jealous of me just now , so as to put the blame on me afterwards . 
He is stupid , he ca n't disguise what he is doing ; he is so open , you know ... . 
But I 'll give it to him , I 'll give it to him ! 
` You believe I did it , ' he said . 
He said that to me , to me . 
He reproached me with that ! 
God forgive him ! 
You wait , I 'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial ! 
I 'll just say a word then ... I 'll tell everything then ! ''
