At last , however , he began brooding over the past , and the strain of it was too much for him . 
Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl and soon after married her , hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely depression , and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children , he would escape from old memories altogether . 
But the very opposite of what he expected happened . 
He began , even in the first month of his marriage , to be continually fretted by the thought , `` My wife loves me - but what if she knew ? '' 
When she first told him that she would soon bear him a child , he was troubled . 
`` I am giving life , but I have taken life . '' 
Children came . 
`` How dare I love them , teach and educate them , how can I talk to them of virtue ? 
I have shed blood . '' 
They were splendid children , he longed to caress them ; `` and I ca n't look at their innocent candid faces , I am unworthy . '' 
At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim , by the young life he had destroyed , by the blood that cried out for vengeance . 
He had begun to have awful dreams . 
But , being a man of fortitude , he bore his suffering a long time , thinking : `` I shall expiate everything by this secret agony . '' 
But that hope , too , was vain ; the longer it went on , the more intense was his suffering . 
He was respected in society for his active benevolence , though everyone was overawed by his stern and gloomy character . 
But the more he was respected , the more intolerable it was for him . 
He confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself . 
But he began to be haunted by another idea - an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable , though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off . 
He dreamed of rising up , going out and confessing in the face of all men that he had committed murder . 
For three years this dream had pursued him , haunting him in different forms . 
At last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed his crime , he would heal his soul and would be at peace for ever . 
But this belief filled his heart with terror , for how could he carry it out ? 
And then came what happened at my duel . 
`` Looking at you , I have made up my mind . '' 
I looked at him . 
`` Is it possible , '' I cried , clasping my hands , `` that such a trivial incident could give rise to a resolution in you ? '' 
`` My resolution has been growing for the last three years , '' he answered , `` and your story only gave the last touch to it . 
Looking at you , I reproached myself and envied you . '' 
He said this to me almost sullenly . 
`` But you wo n't be believed , '' I observed ; `` it 's fourteen years ago . '' 
`` I have proofs , great proofs . 
I shall show them . '' 
Then I cried and kissed him . 
`` Tell me one thing , one thing , '' he said -LRB- as though it all depended upon me -RRB- , `` my wife , my children ! 
My wife may die of grief , and though my children wo n't lose their rank and property , they 'll be a convict 's children and for ever ! 
And what a memory , what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts ! '' 
I said nothing . 
`` And to part from them , to leave them for ever ? 
It 's for ever , you know , for ever ! '' 
I sat still and repeated a silent prayer . 
I got up at last , I felt afraid . 
`` Well ? '' 
He looked at me . 
`` Go ! '' 
said I , `` confess . 
Everything passes , only the truth remains . 
Your children will understand , when they grow up , the nobility of your resolution . '' 
He left me that time as though he had made up his mind . 
Yet for more than a fortnight afterwards , he came to me every evening , still preparing himself , still unable to bring himself to the point . 
He made my heart ache .
