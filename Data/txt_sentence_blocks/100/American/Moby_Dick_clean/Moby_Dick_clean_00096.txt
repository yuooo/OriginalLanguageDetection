ETYMOLOGY -LRB- Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School -RRB- The pale Usher -- threadbare in coat , heart , body , and brain ; I see him now . 
He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars , with a queer handkerchief , mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world . 
He loved to dust his old grammars ; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality . 
`` While you take in hand to school others , and to teach them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out , through ignorance , the letter H , which almost alone maketh the signification of the word , you deliver that which is not true . ''

EXTRACTS -LRB- Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian -RRB- It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth , picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever , sacred or profane . 
therefore you must not , in every case at least , take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements , however authentic , in these extracts , for veritable gospel cetology . 
Far from it . 
As touching the ancient authors generally , as well as the poets here appearing , these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining , as affording a glancing bird 's eye view of what has been promiscuously said , thought , fancied , and sung of Leviathan , by many nations and generations , including our own . 
So fare thee well , poor devil of a Sub-Sub , whose commentator I am . 
Thou belongest to that hopeless , sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong ; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit , and feel poor-devilish , too ; and grow convivial upon tears ; and say to them bluntly , with full eyes and empty glasses , and in not altogether unpleasant sadness -- Give it up , Sub-Subs ! 
For by how much more pains ye take to please the world , by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless ! 
Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye ! 
But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts ; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens , and making refugees of long pampered Gabriel , Michael , and Raphael , against your coming . 
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together -- there , ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses !

He said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days . ''
