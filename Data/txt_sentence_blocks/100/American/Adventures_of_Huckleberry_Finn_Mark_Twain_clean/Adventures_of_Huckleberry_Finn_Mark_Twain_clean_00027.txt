`` Old man , '' said the young one , `` I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think ? '' 
`` I ai n't undisposed . 
What 's your line -- mainly ? '' 
`` Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work . 
What 's your lay ? '' 
`` I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time . 
Layin ' on o ' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k 'n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me . 
Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around . '' 
Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : `` Alas ! '' 
`` What 're you alassin ' about ? '' 
says the bald-head . 
`` To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . '' 
And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag . 
`` Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? '' 
says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish . 
`` Yes , it IS good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high ? 
I did myself . 
I do n't blame YOU , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody . 
I deserve it all . 
Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me . 
The world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me -- loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that . 
Some day I 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest . '' 
He went on a-wiping . 
`` Drot your pore broken heart , '' says the baldhead ; `` what are you heaving your pore broken heart at US f ` r ? 
WE hai n't done nothing . '' 
`` No , I know you have n't . 
I ai n't blaming you , gentlemen . 
I brought myself down -- yes , I did it myself . 
It 's right I should suffer -- perfectly right -- I do n't make any moan . '' 
`` Brought you down from whar ? 
Whar was you brought down from ? '' 
`` Ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes -- let it pass -- 't is no matter . 
The secret of my birth -- '' `` The secret of your birth ! 
Do you mean to say -- '' `` Gentlemen , '' says the young man , very solemn , `` I will reveal it to you , for I feel I may have confidence in you . 
By rights I am a duke ! '' 
Jim 's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and I reckon mine did , too . 
Then the baldhead says : `` No ! 
you ca n't mean it ? '' 
`` Yes . 
My great-grandfather , eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time . 
The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored . 
I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft ! '' 
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I . 
We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how . 
He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say `` Your Grace , '' or `` My Lord , '' or `` Your Lordship '' -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain `` Bridgewater , '' which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done . 
Well , that was all easy , so we done it . 
All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him , and says , `` Will yo ' Grace have some o ' dis or some o ' dat ? '' 
and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him . 
But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke . 
He seemed to have something on his mind . 
So , along in the afternoon , he says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , '' he says , `` I 'm nation sorry for you , but you ai n't the only person that 's had troubles like that . '' 
`` No ? '' 
`` No you ai n't . 
You ai n't the only person that 's ben snaked down wrongfully out 'n a high place . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
`` No , you ai n't the only person that 's had a secret of his birth . '' 
And , by jings , HE begins to cry . 
`` Hold ! 
What do you mean ? '' 
`` Bilgewater , kin I trust you ? '' 
says the old man , still sort of sobbing . 
`` To the bitter death ! '' 
He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , `` That secret of your being : speak ! '' 
`` Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphin ! '' 
You bet you , Jim and me stared this time . 
Then the duke says : `` You are what ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend , it is too true -- your eyes is lookin ' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin , Looy the Seventeen , son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette . '' 
`` You ! 
At your age ! 
No ! 
You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . '' 
`` Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude . 
Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin ' , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin ' rightful King of France . '' 
Well , he cried and took on so that me and Jim did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry -- and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too . 
So we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort HIM . 
But he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him `` Your Majesty , '' and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them . 
So Jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t ` other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down . 
This done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable . 
But the duke kind of soured on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke 's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : `` Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft , Bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour ? 
It 'll only make things oncomfortable . 
It ai n't my fault I war n't born a duke , it ai n't your fault you war n't born a king -- so what 's the use to worry ? 
Make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says I -- that 's my motto . 
This ai n't no bad thing that we 've struck here -- plenty grub and an easy life -- come , give us your hand , duke , and le 's all be friends . '' 
The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it . 
It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others . 
It did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds . 
But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble . 
If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , ` long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him . 
If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way . 
THEY asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running -- was Jim a runaway nigger ? 
Says I : `` Goodness sakes ! 
would a runaway nigger run SOUTH ? '' 
No , they allowed he would n't . 
I had to account for things some way , so I says : `` My folks was living in Pike County , in Missouri , where I was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike . 
Pa , he ` lowed he 'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben , who 's got a little one - horse place on the river , forty-four mile below Orleans . 
Pa was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he 'd squared up there war n't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , Jim . 
That war n't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way . 
Well , when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we 'd go down to Orleans on it . 
Pa 's luck did n't hold out ; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; Jim and me come up all right , but pa was drunk , and Ike was only four years old , so they never come up no more . 
Well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger .
