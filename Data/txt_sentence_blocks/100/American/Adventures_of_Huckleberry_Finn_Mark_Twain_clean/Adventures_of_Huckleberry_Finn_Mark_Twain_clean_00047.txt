I says ; `` you 're joking . '' 
`` I ai n't joking , either . '' 
`` Well , then , '' I says , `` joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , do n't forget to remember that YOU do n't know nothing about him , and I do n't know nothing about him . '' 
Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and I drove mine . 
But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip . 
The old gentleman was at the door , and he says : `` Why , this is wonderful ! 
Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ? 
I wish we 'd a timed her . 
And she hai n't sweated a hair -- not a hair . 
It 's wonderful . 
Why , I would n't take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I would n't , honest ; and yet I 'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 't was all she was worth . '' 
That 's all he said . 
He was the innocentest , best old soul I ever see . 
But it war n't surprising ; because he war n't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too . 
There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that , and done the same way , down South . 
In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : `` Why , there 's somebody come ! 
I wonder who 't is ? 
Why , I do believe it 's a stranger . 
Jimmy '' -LRB- that 's one of the children -RRB- `` run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner . '' 
Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come EVERY year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come . 
Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door . 
Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer . 
In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable . 
He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram . 
When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : `` Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? '' 
`` No , my boy , '' says the old gentleman , `` I 'm sorry to say ' t your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more . 
Come in , come in . '' 
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , `` Too late -- he 's out of sight . '' 
`` Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's . '' 
`` Oh , I CA N'T make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it . 
I 'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance . '' 
`` But we wo n't LET you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it . 
Come right in . '' 
`` Oh , DO , '' says Aunt Sally ; `` it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world . 
You must stay . 
It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk . 
And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us . 
Come right in and make yourself at home . '' 
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow . 
Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : `` You owdacious puppy ! '' 
He looked kind of hurt , and says : `` I 'm surprised at you , m ` am . '' 
`` You 're s ` rp -- Why , what do you reckon I am ? 
I 've a good notion to take and -- Say , what do you mean by kissing me ? '' 
He looked kind of humble , and says : `` I did n't mean nothing , m ` am . 
I did n't mean no harm . 
I -- I -- thought you 'd like it . '' 
`` Why , you born fool ! '' 
She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it . 
`` What made you think I 'd like it ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know . 
Only , they -- they -- told me you would . '' 
`` THEY told you I would . 
Whoever told you 's ANOTHER lunatic . 
I never heard the beat of it . 
Who 's THEY ? '' 
`` Why , everybody . 
They all said so , m ` am . '' 
It was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says : `` Who 's ` everybody ' ? 
Out with their names , or ther 'll be an idiot short . '' 
He got up and looked distressed , and fumbled his hat , and says : `` I 'm sorry , and I war n't expecting it . 
They told me to . 
They all told me to . 
They all said , kiss her ; and said she 'd like it . 
They all said it -- every one of them . 
But I 'm sorry , m ` am , and I wo n't do it no more -- I wo n't , honest . '' 
`` You wo n't , wo n't you ? 
Well , I sh 'd RECKON you wo n't ! '' 
`` No 'm , I 'm honest about it ; I wo n't ever do it again -- till you ask me . '' 
`` Till I ASK you ! 
Well , I never see the beat of it in my born days ! 
I lay you 'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you -- or the likes of you . '' 
`` Well , '' he says , `` it does surprise me so . 
I ca n't make it out , somehow . 
They said you would , and I thought you would . 
But -- '' He stopped and looked around slow , like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres , and fetched up on the old gentleman 's , and says , `` Did n't YOU think she 'd like me to kiss her , sir ? '' 
`` Why , no ; I -- I -- well , no , I b ` lieve I did n't . '' 
Then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : `` Tom , did n't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say , ` Sid Sawyer -- ' '' `` My land ! '' 
she says , breaking in and jumping for him , `` you impudent young rascal , to fool a body so -- '' and was going to hug him , but he fended her off , and says : `` No , not till you 've asked me first . '' 
So she did n't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left . 
And after they got a little quiet again she says : `` Why , dear me , I never see such a surprise . 
We war n't looking for YOU at all , but only Tom . 
Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him . '' 
`` It 's because it war n't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom , '' he says ; `` but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger . 
But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally . 
This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come . '' 
`` No -- not impudent whelps , Sid . 
You ought to had your jaws boxed ; I hai n't been so put out since I do n't know when . 
But I do n't care , I do n't mind the terms -- I 'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here . 
Well , to think of that performance ! 
I do n't deny it , I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack . '' 
We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ; and there was things enough on that table for seven families -- and all hot , too ; none of your flabby , tough meat that 's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning . 
Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it , but it was worth it ; and it did n't cool it a bit , neither , the way I 've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times . 
There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon , and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time ; but it war n't no use , they did n't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger , and we was afraid to try to work up to it . 
But at supper , at night , one of the little boys says : `` Pa , may n't Tom and Sid and me go to the show ? '' 
`` No , '' says the old man , `` I reckon there ai n't going to be any ; and you could n't go if there was ; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show , and Burton said he would tell the people ; so I reckon they 've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time . '' 
So there it was ! 
-- but I could n't help it . 
Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ; so , being tired , we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper , and clumb out of the window and down the lightning - rod , and shoved for the town ; for I did n't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint , and so if I did n't hurry up and give them one they 'd get into trouble sure . 
On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered , and how pap disappeared pretty soon , and did n't come back no more , and what a stir there was when Jim run away ; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions , and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to ; and as we struck into the town and up through the -- here comes a raging rush of people with torches , and an awful whooping and yelling , and banging tin pans and blowing horns ; and we jumped to one side to let them go by ; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail -- that is , I knowed it WAS the king and the duke , though they was all over tar and feathers , and did n't look like nothing in the world that was human -- just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes . 
Well , it made me sick to see it ; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like I could n't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world .
