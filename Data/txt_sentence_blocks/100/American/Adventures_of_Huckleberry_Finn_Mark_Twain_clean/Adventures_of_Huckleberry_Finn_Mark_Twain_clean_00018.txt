`` Yes , the widow told me all about it . '' 
`` WELL , den ! 
Warn ' dat de beatenes ' notion in de worl ' ? 
You jes ' take en look at it a minute . 
Dah 's de stump , dah -- dat 's one er de women ; heah 's you -- dat 's de yuther one ; I 's Sollermun ; en dish yer dollar bill 's de chile . 
Bofe un you claims it . 
What does I do ? 
Does I shin aroun ' mongs ' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b ` long to , en han ' it over to de right one , all safe en soun ' , de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would ? 
No ; I take en whack de bill in TWO , en give half un it to you , en de yuther half to de yuther woman . 
Dat 's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile . 
Now I want to ast you : what 's de use er dat half a bill ? 
-- ca n't buy noth 'n wid it . 
En what use is a half a chile ? 
I wouldn ' give a dern for a million un um . '' 
`` But hang it , Jim , you 've clean missed the point -- blame it , you 've missed it a thousand mile . '' 
`` Who ? 
Me ? 
Go ` long . 
Doan ' talk to me ` bout yo ' pints . 
I reck 'n I knows sense when I sees it ; en dey ain ' no sense in sich doin 's as dat . 
De ` spute war n't ` bout a half a chile , de ` spute was ` bout a whole chile ; en de man dat think he kin settle a ` spute ` bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan ' know enough to come in out 'n de rain . 
Doan ' talk to me ` bout Sollermun , Huck , I knows him by de back . '' 
`` But I tell you you do n't get the point . '' 
`` Blame de point ! 
I reck 'n I knows what I knows . 
En mine you , de REAL pint is down furder -- it 's down deeper . 
It lays in de way Sollermun was raised . 
You take a man dat 's got on ' y one or two chillen ; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o ' chillen ? 
No , he ai n't ; he ca n't ` ford it . 
HE know how to value 'em . 
But you take a man dat 's got ` bout five million chillen runnin ' roun ' de house , en it 's diffunt . 
HE as soon chop a chile in two as a cat . 
Dey 's plenty mo ' . 
A chile er two , mo ' er less , war n't no consekens to Sollermun , dad fatch him ! '' 
I never see such a nigger . 
If he got a notion in his head once , there war n't no getting it out again . 
He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see . 
So I went to talking about other kings , and let Solomon slide . 
I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago ; and about his little boy the dolphin , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there . 
`` Po ' little chap . '' 
`` But some says he got out and got away , and come to America . '' 
`` Dat 's good ! 
But he 'll be pooty lonesome -- dey ain ' no kings here , is dey , Huck ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Den he cai n't git no situation . 
What he gwyne to do ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know . 
Some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk French . '' 
`` Why , Huck , doan ' de French people talk de same way we does ? '' 
`` NO , Jim ; you could n't understand a word they said -- not a single word . '' 
`` Well , now , I be ding-busted ! 
How do dat come ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; but it 's so . 
I got some of their jabber out of a book . 
S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy -- what would you think ? '' 
`` I wouldn ' think nuff ` n ; I 'd take en bust him over de head -- dat is , if he war n't white . 
I would n't ` low no nigger to call me dat . '' 
`` Shucks , it ai n't calling you anything . 
It 's only saying , do you know how to talk French ? '' 
`` Well , den , why could n't he SAY it ? '' 
`` Why , he IS a-saying it . 
That 's a Frenchman 's WAY of saying it . '' 
`` Well , it 's a blame ridicklous way , en I doan ' want to hear no mo ' ` bout it . 
Dey ain ' no sense in it . '' 
`` Looky here , Jim ; does a cat talk like we do ? '' 
`` No , a cat do n't . '' 
`` Well , does a cow ? '' 
`` No , a cow do n't , nuther . '' 
`` Does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ? '' 
`` No , dey do n't . '' 
`` It 's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ai n't it ? '' 
`` Course . '' 
`` And ai n't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from US ? '' 
`` Why , mos ' sholy it is . '' 
`` Well , then , why ai n't it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to talk different from us ? 
You answer me that . '' 
`` Is a cat a man , Huck ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well , den , dey ai n't no sense in a cat talkin ' like a man . 
Is a cow a man ? 
-- er is a cow a cat ? '' 
`` No , she ai n't either of them . '' 
`` Well , den , she ai n't got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of 'em . 
Is a Frenchman a man ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` WELL , den ! 
Dad blame it , why doan ' he TALK like a man ? 
You answer me DAT ! '' 
I see it war n't no use wasting words -- you ca n't learn a nigger to argue . 
So I quit . 
WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo , at the bottom of Illinois , where the Ohio River comes in , and that was what we was after . 
We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States , and then be out of trouble . 
Well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to . 
I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went . 
I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards . 
I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke . 
But she did n't come . 
I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her . 
I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them . 
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
