Do n't cry , bub . 
What 's the trouble ? '' 
I says : `` Pap , and mam , and sis , and -- '' Then I broke down . 
He says : `` Oh , dang it now , DO N'T take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this 'n 'll come out all right . 
What 's the matter with 'em ? '' 
`` They 're -- they 're -- are you the watchman of the boat ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he says , kind of pretty-well-satisfied like . 
`` I 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand ; and sometimes I 'm the freight and passengers . 
I ai n't as rich as old Jim Hornback , and I ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to Tom , Dick , and Harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but I 've told him a many a time ' t I would n't trade places with him ; for , says I , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and I 'm derned if I 'D live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin ' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it . 
Says I -- '' I broke in and says : `` They 're in an awful peck of trouble , and -- '' `` WHO is ? '' 
`` Why , pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there -- '' `` Up where ? 
Where are they ? '' 
`` On the wreck . '' 
`` What wreck ? '' 
`` Why , there ai n't but one . '' 
`` What , you do n't mean the Walter Scott ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good land ! 
what are they doin ' THERE , for gracious sakes ? '' 
`` Well , they did n't go there a-purpose . '' 
`` I bet they did n't ! 
Why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick ! 
Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ? '' 
`` Easy enough . 
Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town -- '' `` Yes , Booth 's Landing -- go on . '' 
`` She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a - floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck . 
Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so WE saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he WAS the best cretur ! 
-- I most wish ' t it had been me , I do . '' 
`` My George ! 
It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck . 
And THEN what did you all do ? '' 
`` Well , we hollered and took on , but it 's so wide there we could n't make nobody hear . 
So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow . 
I was the only one that could swim , so I made a dash for it , and Miss Hooker she said if I did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing . 
I made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , ` What , in such a night and such a current ? 
There ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . ' 
Now if you 'll go and -- '' `` By Jackson , I 'd LIKE to , and , blame it , I do n't know but I will ; but who in the dingnation 's a-going ' to PAY for it ? 
Do you reckon your pap -- '' `` Why THAT 'S all right . 
Miss Hooker she tole me , PARTICULAR , that her uncle Hornback -- '' `` Great guns ! 
is HE her uncle ? 
Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill . 
And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news . 
Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town . 
Hump yourself , now ; I 'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer . '' 
I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start . 
But take it all around , I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it . 
I wished the widow knowed about it . 
I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in . 
Well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down ! 
A kind of cold shiver went through me , and then I struck out for her . 
She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her . 
I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still . 
I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could . 
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river . 
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off . 
By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people . 
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars . 
We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives . 
The seegars was prime . 
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time . 
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he did n't want no more adventures . 
He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure . 
Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger . 
I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , ` stead of mister ; and Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he was interested . 
He says : `` I didn ' know dey was so many un um . 
I hai n't hearn ` bout none un um , skasely , but ole King Sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er k ` yards . 
How much do a king git ? '' 
`` Get ? '' 
I says ; `` why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them . '' 
`` AIN ' dat gay ? 
En what dey got to do , Huck ? '' 
`` THEY do n't do nothing ! 
Why , how you talk ! 
They just set around . '' 
`` No ; is dat so ? '' 
`` Of course it is . 
They just set around -- except , maybe , when there 's a war ; then they go to the war . 
But other times they just lazy around ; or go hawking -- just hawking and sp -- Sh ! 
-- d' you hear a noise ? '' 
We skipped out and looked ; but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back . 
`` Yes , '' says I , `` and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody do n't go just so he whacks their heads off . 
But mostly they hang round the harem . '' 
`` Roun ' de which ? '' 
`` Harem . '' 
`` What 's de harem ? '' 
`` The place where he keeps his wives . 
Do n't you know about the harem ? 
Solomon had one ; he had about a million wives . '' 
`` Why , yes , dat 's so ; I -- I 'd done forgot it . 
A harem 's a bo 'd ` n-house , I reck ` n. Mos ' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery . 
En I reck 'n de wives quarrels considable ; en dat ` crease de racket . 
Yit dey say Sollermun de wises ' man dat ever live ' . 
I doan ' take no stock in dat . 
Bekase why : would a wise man want to live in de mids ' er sich a blim - blammin ' all de time ? 
No -- ` deed he would n't . 
A wise man ` ud take en buil ' a biler-factry ; en den he could shet DOWN de biler-factry when he want to res ' . '' 
`` Well , but he WAS the wisest man , anyway ; because the widow she told me so , her own self . '' 
`` I doan k ` yer what de widder say , he WAR N'T no wise man nuther . 
He had some er de dad-fetchedes ' ways I ever see . 
Does you know ` bout dat chile dat he ` uz gwyne to chop in two ? ''
