I did n't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ; and I could n't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach . 
So for a minute I did n't say nothing ; then I says : `` I 'd ruther not TELL you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane , if you do n't mind letting me off ; but I 'll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop 's , if you want to . 
Do you reckon that 'll do ? '' 
`` Oh , yes . '' 
So I wrote : `` I put it in the coffin . 
It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night . 
I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane . '' 
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : `` GOOD-bye . 
I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha 'n' t ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll PRAY for you , too ! '' 
-- and she was gone . 
Pray for me ! 
I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size . 
But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind . 
She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge . 
You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand . 
It sounds like flattery , but it ai n't no flattery . 
And when it comes to beauty -- and goodness , too -- she lays over them all . 
I hai n't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door ; no , I hai n't ever seen her since , but I reckon I 've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever I 'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER , blamed if I would n't a done it or bust . 
Well , Mary Jane she lit out the back way , I reckon ; because nobody see her go . 
When I struck Susan and the hare-lip , I says : `` What 's the name of them people over on t ` other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes ? '' 
They says : `` There 's several ; but it 's the Proctors , mainly . '' 
`` That 's the name , '' I says ; `` I most forgot it . 
Well , Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she 's gone over there in a dreadful hurry -- one of them 's sick . '' 
`` Which one ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; leastways , I kinder forget ; but I thinks it 's -- '' `` Sakes alive , I hope it ai n't HANNER ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry to say it , '' I says , `` but Hanner 's the very one . '' 
`` My goodness , and she so well only last week ! 
Is she took bad ? '' 
`` It ai n't no name for it . 
They set up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they do n't think she 'll last many hours . '' 
`` Only think of that , now ! 
What 's the matter with her ? '' 
I could n't think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so I says : `` Mumps . '' 
`` Mumps your granny ! 
They do n't set up with people that 's got the mumps . '' 
`` They do n't , do n't they ? 
You better bet they do with THESE mumps . 
These mumps is different . 
It 's a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said . '' 
`` How 's it a new kind ? '' 
`` Because it 's mixed up with other things . '' 
`` What other things ? '' 
`` Well , measles , and whooping-cough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brain-fever , and I do n't know what all . '' 
`` My land ! 
And they call it the MUMPS ? '' 
`` That 's what Miss Mary Jane said . '' 
`` Well , what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for ? '' 
`` Why , because it IS the mumps . 
That 's what it starts with . '' 
`` Well , ther ' ai n't no sense in it . 
A body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , ` Why , he stumped his TOE . ' 
Would ther ' be any sense in that ? 
NO . 
And ther ' ai n't no sense in THIS , nuther . 
Is it ketching ? '' 
`` Is it KETCHING ? 
Why , how you talk . 
Is a HARROW catching -- in the dark ? 
If you do n't hitch on to one tooth , you 're bound to on another , ai n't you ? 
And you ca n't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along , can you ? 
Well , these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow , as you may say -- and it ai n't no slouch of a harrow , nuther , you come to get it hitched on good . '' 
`` Well , it 's awful , I think , '' says the hare-lip . 
`` I 'll go to Uncle Harvey and -- '' `` Oh , yes , '' I says , `` I WOULD . 
Of COURSE I would . 
I would n't lose no time . '' 
`` Well , why would n't you ? '' 
`` Just look at it a minute , and maybe you can see . 
Hai n't your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can ? 
And do you reckon they 'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves ? 
YOU know they 'll wait for you . 
So fur , so good . 
Your uncle Harvey 's a preacher , ai n't he ? 
Very well , then ; is a PREACHER going to deceive a steamboat clerk ? 
is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK ? 
-- so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard ? 
Now YOU know he ai n't . 
What WILL he do , then ? 
Why , he 'll say , ` It 's a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps , and so it 's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she 's got it . ' 
But never mind , if you think it 's best to tell your uncle Harvey -- '' `` Shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane 's got it or not ? 
Why , you talk like a muggins . '' 
`` Well , anyway , maybe you 'd better tell some of the neighbors . '' 
`` Listen at that , now . 
You do beat all for natural stupidness . 
Ca n't you SEE that THEY 'D go and tell ? 
Ther ' ai n't no way but just to not tell anybody at ALL . '' 
`` Well , maybe you 're right -- yes , I judge you ARE right . '' 
`` But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she 's gone out a while , anyway , so he wo n't be uneasy about her ? '' 
`` Yes , Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that . 
She says , ` Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss , and say I 've run over the river to see Mr. ' -- Mr. -- what IS the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of ? 
-- I mean the one that -- '' `` Why , you must mean the Apthorps , ai n't it ? '' 
`` Of course ; bother them kind of names , a body ca n't ever seem to remember them , half the time , somehow . 
Yes , she said , say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house , because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else ; and she 's going to stick to them till they say they 'll come , and then , if she ai n't too tired , she 's coming home ; and if she is , she 'll be home in the morning anyway . 
She said , do n't say nothing about the Proctors , but only about the Apthorps -- which 'll be perfectly true , because she is going there to speak about their buying the house ; I know it , because she told me so herself . '' 
`` All right , '' they said , and cleared out to lay for their uncles , and give them the love and the kisses , and tell them the message . 
Everything was all right now . 
The girls would n't say nothing because they wanted to go to England ; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson . 
I felt very good ; I judged I had done it pretty neat -- I reckoned Tom Sawyer could n't a done it no neater himself . 
Of course he would a throwed more style into it , but I ca n't do that very handy , not being brung up to it . 
Well , they held the auction in the public square , along towards the end of the afternoon , and it strung along , and strung along , and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest , up there longside of the auctioneer , and chipping in a little Scripture now and then , or a little goody-goody saying of some kind , and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how , and just spreading himself generly . 
But by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was sold -- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
