`` Well , have my room -- have this room . '' 
`` But how can I sleep ? 
If I sleep -- he will get away . 
Ugh ! 
What does it matter ? '' 
`` What 's the shot wound ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
`` Nothing -- scratch and blood . 
Oh , God ! 
How I want sleep ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp . 
`` Because I 've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men , '' he said slowly . 
Kemp started . 
`` Fool that I am ! '' 
said the Invisible Man , striking the table smartly . 
`` I 've put the idea into your head . '' 
THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was , he refused to accept Kemp 's word that his freedom should be respected . 
He examined the two windows of the bedroom , drew up the blinds and opened the sashes , to confirm Kemp 's statement that a retreat by them would be possible . 
Outside the night was very quiet and still , and the new moon was setting over the down . 
Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors , to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom . 
Finally he expressed himself satisfied . 
He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the sound of a yawn . 
`` I 'm sorry , '' said the Invisible Man , `` if I can not tell you all that I have done to-night . 
But I am worn out . 
It 's grotesque , no doubt . 
It 's horrible ! 
But believe me , Kemp , in spite of your arguments of this morning , it is quit a possible thing . 
I have made a discovery . 
I meant to keep it to myself . 
I ca n't . 
I must have a partner . 
And you ... . 
We can do such things ... But to-morrow . 
Now , Kemp , I feel as though I must sleep or perish . '' 
Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment . 
`` I suppose I must leave you , '' he said . 
`` It 's -- incredible . 
Three things happening like this , overturning all my preconceptions -- would make me insane . 
But it 's real ! 
Is there anything more that I can get you ? '' 
`` Only bid me good-night , '' said Griffin . 
`` Good-night , '' said Kemp , and shook an invisible hand . 
He walked sideways to the door . 
Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him . 
`` Understand me ! '' 
said the dressing-gown . 
`` No attempts to hamper me , or capture me ! 
Or -- '' Kemp 's face changed a little . 
`` I thought I gave you my word , '' he said . 
Kemp closed the door softly behind him , and the key was turned upon him forthwith . 
Then , as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face , the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked . 
Kemp slapped his brow with his hand . 
`` Am I dreaming ? 
Has the world gone mad -- or have I ? '' 
He laughed , and put his hand to the locked door . 
`` Barred out of my own bedroom , by a flagrant absurdity ! '' 
he said . 
He walked to the head of the staircase , turned , and stared at the locked doors . 
`` It 's fact , '' he said . 
He put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck . 
`` Undeniable fact ! 
`` But -- '' He shook his head hopelessly , turned , and went downstairs . 
He lit the dining-room lamp , got out a cigar , and began pacing the room , ejaculating . 
Now and then he would argue with himself . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
he said . 
`` Is there such a thing as an invisible animal ? 
... In the sea , yes . 
Thousands -- millions . 
All the larvae , all the little nauplii and tornarias , all the microscopic things , the jelly-fish . 
In the sea there are more things invisible than visible ! 
I never thought of that before . 
And in the ponds too ! 
All those little pond-life things -- specks of colourless translucent jelly ! 
But in air ? 
No ! 
`` It ca n't be . 
`` But after all -- why not ? 
`` If a man was made of glass he would still be visible . '' 
His meditation became profound . 
The bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again . 
Then it was merely an exclamation . 
He turned aside , walked out of the room , and went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there . 
It was a little room , because Dr. Kemp did not live by practice , and in it were the day 's newspapers . 
The morning 's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside . 
He caught it up , turned it over , and read the account of a `` Strange Story from Iping '' that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel . 
Kemp read it swiftly . 
`` Wrapped up ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Disguised ! 
Hiding it ! 
` No one seems to have been aware of his misfortune . ' 
What the devil is his game ? '' 
He dropped the paper , and his eye went seeking . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he said , and caught up the St. James ' Gazette , lying folded up as it arrived . 
`` Now we shall get at the truth , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
He rent the paper open ; a couple of columns confronted him . 
`` An Entire Village in Sussex goes Mad '' was the heading .
