They were shouting in the street before Marvel was halfway there . 
They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them , with the news . 
He heard it and made one last desperate spurt . 
Fear came striding by , rushed ahead of him , and in a moment had seized the town . 
`` The Invisible Man is coming ! 
The Invisible Man ! '' 
IN THE `` JOLLY CRICKETERS '' The `` Jolly Cricketers '' is just at the bottom of the hill , where the tram-lines begin . 
The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman , while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese , drank Burton , and conversed in American with a policeman off duty . 
`` What 's the shouting about ! '' 
said the anaemic cabman , going off at a tangent , trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn . 
Somebody ran by outside . 
`` Fire , perhaps , '' said the barman . 
Footsteps approached , running heavily , the door was pushed open violently , and Marvel , weeping and dishevelled , his hat gone , the neck of his coat torn open , rushed in , made a convulsive turn , and attempted to shut the door . 
It was held half open by a strap . 
`` Coming ! '' 
he bawled , his voice shrieking with terror . 
`` He 's coming . 
The ` Visible Man ! 
After me ! 
For Gawd 's sake ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! '' 
`` Shut the doors , '' said the policeman . 
`` Who 's coming ? 
What 's the row ? '' 
He went to the door , released the strap , and it slammed . 
The American closed the other door . 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , staggering and weeping , but still clutching the books . 
`` Lem me go inside . 
Lock me in -- somewhere . 
I tell you he 's after me . 
I give him the slip . 
He said he 'd kill me and he will . '' '' 
_ You 're _ safe , '' said the man with the black beard . 
`` The door 's shut . 
What 's it all about ? '' 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside . 
`` Hullo , '' cried the policeman , `` who 's there ? '' 
Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors . 
`` He 'll kill me -- he 's got a knife or something . 
For Gawd 's sake -- ! '' 
`` Here you are , '' said the barman . 
`` Come in here . '' 
And he held up the flap of the bar . 
Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated . 
`` Do n't open the door , '' he screamed . 
`` Please do n't open the door . 
Where shall I hide ? '' 
`` This , this Invisible Man , then ? '' 
asked the man with the black beard , with one hand behind him . 
`` I guess it 's about time we saw him . '' 
The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in , and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street . 
The policeman had been standing on the settee staring out , craning to see who was at the door . 
He got down with raised eyebrows . 
`` It 's that , '' he said . 
The barman stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr. Marvel , stared at the smashed window , and came round to the two other men . 
Everything was suddenly quiet . 
`` I wish I had my truncheon , '' said the policeman , going irresolutely to the door . 
`` Once we open , in he comes . 
There 's no stopping him . '' 
`` Do n't you be in too much hurry about that door , '' said the anaemic cabman , anxiously . 
`` Draw the bolts , '' said the man with the black beard , `` and if he comes -- '' He showed a revolver in his hand . 
`` That wo n't do , '' said the policeman ; `` that 's murder . '' 
`` I know what country I 'm in , '' said the man with the beard . 
`` I 'm going to let off at his legs . 
Draw the bolts . '' 
`` Not with that blinking thing going off behind me , '' said the barman , craning over the blind . 
`` Very well , '' said the man with the black beard , and stooping down , revolver ready , drew them himself . 
Barman , cabman , and policeman faced about . 
`` Come in , '' said the bearded man in an undertone , standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him . 
No one came in , the door remained closed . 
Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously , they were still waiting , and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information . 
`` Are all the doors of the house shut ? '' 
asked Marvel . 
`` He 's going round -- prowling round . 
He 's as artful as the devil . '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
said the burly barman . 
`` There 's the back ! 
Just watch them doors ! 
I say -- ! '' 
He looked about him helplessly . 
The bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn . 
`` There 's the yard door and the private door . 
The yard door -- '' He rushed out of the bar . 
In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand . 
`` The yard door was open ! '' 
he said , and his fat underlip dropped . 
`` He may be in the house now ! '' 
said the first cabman . 
`` He 's not in the kitchen , '' said the barman . 
`` There 's two women there , and I 've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer . 
And they do n't think he 's come in . 
They have n't noticed -- '' `` Have you fastened it ? '' 
asked the first cabman . 
`` I 'm out of frocks , '' said the barman . 
The man with the beard replaced his revolver . 
And even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked , and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open . 
They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret , and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue .
