`` Good Heavens ! '' 
said Kemp , reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in Iping , of the previous afternoon , that have already been described . 
Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted . 
He re-read it . 
`` Ran through the streets striking right and left . 
Jaffers insensible . 
Mr. Huxter in great pain -- still unable to describe what he saw . 
Painful humiliation -- vicar . 
Woman ill with terror ! 
Windows smashed . 
This extraordinary story probably a fabrication . 
Too good not to print -- cum grano ! '' 
He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him . 
`` Probably a fabrication ! '' 
He caught up the paper again , and re-read the whole business . 
`` But when does the Tramp come in ? 
Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp ? '' 
He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench . 
`` He 's not only invisible , '' he said , `` but he 's mad ! 
Homicidal ! '' 
When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room , Kemp was still pacing up and down , trying to grasp the incredible . 
He was altogether too excited to sleep . 
His servants , descending sleepily , discovered him , and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill on him . 
He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere study -- and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor . 
Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning 's paper came . 
That had much to say and little to tell , beyond the confirmation of the evening before , and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock . 
This gave Kemp the essence of the happenings at the `` Jolly Cricketers , '' and the name of Marvel . 
`` He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours , '' Marvel testified . 
Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story , notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire . 
But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp ; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no information about the three books , or the money with which he was lined . 
The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter . 
Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get everyone of the morning papers she could . 
These also he devoured . 
`` He is invisible ! '' 
he said . 
`` And it reads like rage growing to mania ! 
The things he may do ! 
The things he may do ! 
And he 's upstairs free as the air . 
What on earth ought I to do ? '' 
`` For instance , would it be a breach of faith if -- ? 
No . '' 
He went to a little untidy desk in the corner , and began a note . 
He tore this up half written , and wrote another . 
He read it over and considered it . 
Then he took an envelope and addressed it to `` Colonel Adye , Port Burdock . '' 
The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this . 
He awoke in an evil temper , and Kemp , alert for every sound , heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead . 
Then a chair was flung over and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed . 
Kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly . 
CERTAIN FIRST PRINCIPLES `` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Kemp , when the Invisible Man admitted him . 
`` Nothing , '' was the answer . 
`` But , confound it ! 
The smash ? '' 
`` Fit of temper , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Forgot this arm ; and it 's sore . '' 
`` You 're rather liable to that sort of thing . '' 
`` I am . '' 
Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass . 
`` All the facts are out about you , '' said Kemp , standing up with the glass in his hand ; `` all that happened in Iping , and down the hill . 
The world has become aware of its invisible citizen . 
But no one knows you are here . '' 
The Invisible Man swore . 
`` The secret 's out . 
I gather it was a secret . 
I do n't know what your plans are , but of course I 'm anxious to help you . '' 
The Invisible Man sat down on the bed . 
`` There 's breakfast upstairs , '' said Kemp , speaking as easily as possible , and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly . 
Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere . 
`` Before we can do anything else , '' said Kemp , `` I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours . '' 
He had sat down , after one nervous glance out of the window , with the air of a man who has talking to do . 
His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the breakfast-table -- a headless , handless dressing-gown , wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette . 
`` It 's simple enough -- and credible enough , '' said Griffin , putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand . 
`` No doubt , to you , but -- '' Kemp laughed . 
`` Well , yes ; to me it seemed wonderful at first , no doubt . 
But now , great God ! 
... But we will do great things yet ! 
I came on the stuff first at Chesilstowe . '' 
`` Chesilstowe ? '' 
`` I went there after I left London . 
You know I dropped medicine and took up physics ? 
No ; well , I did . 
Light fascinated me . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` Optical density ! 
The whole subject is a network of riddles -- a network with solutions glimmering elusively through . 
And being but two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm , I said , ' I will devote my life to this . 
This is worth while . ' 
You know what fools we are at two-and-twenty ? '' 
`` Fools then or fools now , '' said Kemp . 
`` As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man ! 
`` But I went to work -- like a slave . 
And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly -- blindingly ! 
I found a general principle of pigments and refraction -- a formula , a geometrical expression involving four dimensions . 
Fools , common men , even common mathematicians , do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics . 
In the books -- the books that tramp has hidden -- there are marvels , miracles ! 
But this was not a method , it was an idea , that might lead to a method by which it would be possible , without changing any other property of matter -- except , in some instances colours -- to lower the refractive index of a substance , solid or liquid , to that of air -- so far as all practical purposes are concerned . '' 
`` Phew ! '' 
said Kemp .
