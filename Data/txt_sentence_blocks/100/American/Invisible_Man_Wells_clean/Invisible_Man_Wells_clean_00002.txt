`` They do , '' he said through his muffler , eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses . 
`` But they take long enough to get well , do n't they ? 
... There was my sister 's son , Tom , jest cut his arm with a scythe , tumbled on it in the ` ayfield , and , bless me ! 
he was three months tied up sir . 
You 'd hardly believe it . 
It 's regular given me a dread of a scythe , sir . '' 
`` I can quite understand that , '' said the visitor . 
`` He was afraid , one time , that he 'd have to have an op ` ration -- he was that bad , sir . '' 
The visitor laughed abruptly , a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth . 
`` Was he ? '' 
he said . 
`` He was , sir . 
And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him , as I had -- my sister being took up with her little ones so much . 
There was bandages to do , sir , and bandages to undo . 
So that if I may make so bold as to say it , sir -- '' `` Will you get me some matches ? '' 
said the visitor , quite abruptly . 
`` My pipe is out . '' 
Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly . 
It was certainly rude of him , after telling him all she had done . 
She gasped at him for a moment , and remembered the two sovereigns . 
She went for the matches . 
`` Thanks , '' he said concisely , as she put them down , and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again . 
It was altogether too discouraging . 
Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages . 
She did not `` make so bold as to say , '' however , after all . 
But his snubbing way had irritated her , and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon . 
The visitor remained in the parlour until four o'clock , without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion . 
For the most part he was quite still during that time ; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the firelight -- perhaps dozing . 
Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals , and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room . 
He seemed to be talking to himself . 
Then the armchair creaked as he sat down again . 
MR. TEDDY HENFREY 'S FIRST IMPRESSIONS At four o'clock , when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea , Teddy Henfrey , the clock-jobber , came into the bar . 
`` My sakes ! 
Mrs. Hall , '' said he , `` but this is terrible weather for thin boots ! '' 
The snow outside was falling faster . 
Mrs. Hall agreed , and then noticed he had his bag with him . 
`` Now you 're here , Mr. Teddy , '' said she , `` I 'd be glad if you 'd give th ' old clock in the parlour a bit of a look . 
'T is going , and it strikes well and hearty ; but the hour-hand wo n't do nuthin ' but point at six . '' 
And leading the way , she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered . 
Her visitor , she saw as she opened the door , was seated in the armchair before the fire , dozing it would seem , with his bandaged head drooping on one side . 
The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire -- which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals , but left his downcast face in darkness -- and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door . 
Everything was ruddy , shadowy , and indistinct to her , the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp , and her eyes were dazzled . 
But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open -- a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face . 
It was the sensation of a moment : the white-bound head , the monstrous goggle eyes , and this huge yawn below it . 
Then he stirred , started up in his chair , put up his hand . 
She opened the door wide , so that the room was lighter , and she saw him more clearly , with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before . 
The shadows , she fancied , had tricked her . 
`` Would you mind , sir , this man a-coming to look at the clock , sir ? '' 
she said , recovering from the momentary shock . 
`` Look at the clock ? '' 
he said , staring round in a drowsy manner , and speaking over his hand , and then , getting more fully awake , `` certainly . '' 
Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp , and he rose and stretched himself . 
Then came the light , and Mr. Teddy Henfrey , entering , was confronted by this bandaged person . 
He was , he says , `` taken aback . '' 
`` Good afternoon , '' said the stranger , regarding him -- as Mr. Henfrey says , with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles -- `` like a lobster . '' 
`` I hope , '' said Mr. Henfrey , `` that it 's no intrusion . '' 
`` None whatever , '' said the stranger . 
`` Though , I understand , '' he said turning to Mrs. Hall , `` that this room is really to be mine for my own private use . '' 
`` I thought , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` you 'd prefer the clock -- '' `` Certainly , '' said the stranger , `` certainly -- but , as a rule , I like to be alone and undisturbed . 
`` But I 'm really glad to have the clock seen to , '' he said , seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey 's manner . 
`` Very glad . '' 
Mr. Henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw , but this anticipation reassured him . 
The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back . 
`` And presently , '' he said , `` when the clock-mending is over , I think I should like to have some tea . 
But not till the clock-mending is over . '' 
Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room -- she made no conversational advances this time , because she did not want to be snubbed in front of Mr. Henfrey -- when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst . 
She told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman , and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow . 
`` You are certain that is the earliest ? '' 
he said . 
She was certain , with a marked coldness . 
`` I should explain , '' he added , `` what I was really too cold and fatigued to do before , that I am an experimental investigator . '' 
`` Indeed , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , much impressed . 
`` And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances . '' 
`` Very useful things indeed they are , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And I 'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries . '' 
`` Of course , sir . '' 
`` My reason for coming to Iping , '' he proceeded , with a certain deliberation of manner , `` was ... a desire for solitude . 
I do not wish to be disturbed in my work . 
In addition to my work , an accident -- '' `` I thought as much , '' said Mrs. Hall to herself . '' 
-- necessitates a certain retirement . 
My eyes -- are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together . 
Lock myself up . 
Sometimes -- now and then . 
Not at present , certainly . 
At such times the slightest disturbance , the entry of a stranger into the room , is a source of excruciating annoyance to me -- it is well these things should be understood . '' 
`` Certainly , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And if I might make so bold as to ask -- '' `` That I think , is all , '' said the stranger , with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will . 
Mrs. Hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion . 
After Mrs. Hall had left the room , he remained standing in front of the fire , glaring , so Mr. Henfrey puts it , at the clock-mending . 
Mr. Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock , and the face , but extracted the works ; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible . 
He worked with the lamp close to him , and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands , and upon the frame and wheels , and left the rest of the room shadowy . 
When he looked up , coloured patches swam in his eyes . 
Being constitutionally of a curious nature , he had removed the works -- a quite unnecessary proceeding -- with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger . 
But the stranger stood there , perfectly silent and still . 
So still , it got on Henfrey 's nerves . 
He felt alone in the room and looked up , and there , grey and dim , was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly , with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them . 
It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another . 
Then Henfrey looked down again . 
Very uncomfortable position ! 
One would like to say something .
