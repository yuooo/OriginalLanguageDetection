You just missed en -- '' There was a disturbance behind , and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house ; first Mr. Hall , very red and determined , th , I heerd the gal scream , and he turned . 
I saw her skirts whisk , and he went after her . 
Did n't take ten seconds . 
Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf ; stood just as if he was staring . 
Not a moment ago .

I tell ` e , ' e ai n't gart no ` ed at all . 
You just missed en -- '' There was a disturbance behind , and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house ; first Mr. Hall , very red and determined , then Mr. Bobby Jaffers , the village constable , and then the wary Mr. Wadgers . 
They had come now armed with a warrant . 
People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances . '' 
` Ed or no ` ed , '' said Jaffers , `` I got to ` rest en , and ` rest en I will . '' 
Mr. Hall marched up the steps , marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open . 
`` Constable , '' he said , `` do your duty . '' 
Jaffers marched in . 
Hall next , Wadgers last . 
They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them , with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other . 
`` That 's him ! '' 
said Hall . 
`` What the devil 's this ? '' 
came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure . 
`` You 're a damned rum customer , mister , '' said Mr. Jaffers . 
`` But ` ed or no ` ed , the warrant says ` body , ' and duty 's duty -- '' `` Keep off ! '' 
said the figure , starting back . 
Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese , and Mr. Hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it . 
Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers ' face . 
In another moment Jaffers , cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . 
He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . 
Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . 
A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together . 
`` Get the feet , '' said Jaffers between his teeth . 
Mr. Hall , endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and Mr. Wadgers , seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers , retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order . 
At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room . 
`` I 'll surrender , '' cried the stranger , though he had Jaffers down , and in another moment he stood up panting , a strange figure , headless and handless -- for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left . 
`` It 's no good , '' he said , as if sobbing for breath . 
It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space , but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun . 
Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs . 
Then he stared . 
`` I say ! '' 
said Jaffers , brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business , `` Darn it ! 
Ca n't use 'em as I can see . '' 
The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone . 
Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down . 
He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks . 
`` Why ! '' 
said Huxter , suddenly , `` that 's not a man at all . 
It 's just empty clothes . 
Look ! 
You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes . 
I could put my arm -- '' He extended his hand ; it seemed to meet something in mid-air , and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation . 
`` I wish you 'd keep your fingers out of my eye , '' said the aerial voice , in a tone of savage expostulation . 
`` The fact is , I 'm all here -- head , hands , legs , and all the rest of it , but it happens I 'm invisible . 
It 's a confounded nuisance , but I am . 
That 's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping , is it ? '' 
The suit of clothes , now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports , stood up , arms akimbo . 
Several other of the men folks had now entered the room , so that it was closely crowded . 
`` Invisible , eh ? '' 
said Huxter , ignoring the stranger 's abuse . 
`` Who ever heard the likes of that ? '' 
`` It 's strange , perhaps , but it 's not a crime . 
Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that 's a different matter , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light , but I got a warrant and it 's all correct . 
What I 'm after ai n't no invisibility , -- it 's burglary . 
There 's a house been broke into and money took . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` And circumstances certainly point -- '' `` Stuff and nonsense ! '' 
said the Invisible Man . 
`` I hope so , sir ; but I 've got my instructions . '' 
`` Well , '' said the stranger , `` I 'll come . 
I 'll come . 
But no handcuffs . '' 
`` It 's the regular thing , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No handcuffs , '' stipulated the stranger . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Jaffers . 
Abruptly the figure sat down , and before any one could realise was was being done , the slippers , socks , and trousers had been kicked off under the table . 
Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat . 
`` Here , stop that , '' said Jaffers , suddenly realising what was happening . 
He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limply and empty in his hand . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
said Jaffers , loudly . 
`` Once he gets the things off -- '' `` Hold him ! '' 
cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger . 
The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall 's face that stopped his open-armed advance , and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton , and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms , even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man 's head . 
Jaffers clutched at it , and only helped to pull it off ; he was struck in the mouth out of the air , and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head . 
`` Look out ! '' 
said everybody , fencing at random and hitting at nothing . 
`` Hold him ! 
Shut the door ! 
Do n't let him loose ! 
I got something ! 
Here he is ! '' 
A perfect Babel of noises they made . 
Everybody , it seemed , was being hit all at once , and Sandy Wadgers , knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose , reopened the door and led the rout . 
The others , following incontinently , were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway . 
The hitting continued .
