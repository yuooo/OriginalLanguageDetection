`` Let me have a stick or something , and I 'll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on . 
That ought to settle him ! 
They 're hard by -- not ten minutes -- '' Another window went the way of its fellows . 
`` You have n't a revolver ? '' 
asked Adye . 
Kemp 's hand went to his pocket . 
Then he hesitated . 
`` I have n't one -- at least to spare . '' 
`` I 'll bring it back , '' said Adye , `` you 'll be safe here . '' 
Kemp , ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness , handed him the weapon . 
`` Now for the door , '' said Adye . 
As they stood hesitating in the hall , they heard one of the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash . 
Kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible . 
His face was a little paler than usual . 
`` You must step straight out , '' said Kemp . 
In another moment Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples . 
He hesitated for a moment , feeling more comfortable with his back against the door . 
Then he marched , upright and square , down the steps . 
He crossed the lawn and approached the gate . 
A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass . 
Something moved near him . 
`` Stop a bit , '' said a Voice , and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Adye , white and grim , and every nerve tense . 
`` Oblige me by going back to the house , '' said the Voice , as tense and grim as Adye 's . 
`` Sorry , '' said Adye a little hoarsely , and moistened his lips with his tongue . 
The Voice was on his left front , he thought . 
Suppose he were to take his luck with a shot ? 
`` What are you going for ? '' 
said the Voice , and there was a quick movement of the two , and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of Adye 's pocket . 
Adye desisted and thought . 
`` Where I go , '' he said slowly , `` is my own business . '' 
The words were still on his lips , when an arm came round his neck , his back felt a knee , and he was sprawling backward . 
He drew clumsily and fired absurdly , and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip . 
He made a vain clutch at a slippery limb , tried to struggle up and fell back . 
`` Damn ! '' 
said Adye . 
The Voice laughed . 
`` I 'd kill you now if it was n't the waste of a bullet , '' it said . 
He saw the revolver in mid-air , six feet off , covering him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Adye , sitting up . 
`` Get up , '' said the Voice . 
Adye stood up . 
`` Attention , '' said the Voice , and then fiercely , `` Do n't try any games . 
Remember I can see your face if you ca n't see mine . 
You 've got to go back to the house . '' 
`` He wo n't let me in , '' said Adye . 
`` That 's a pity , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` I 've got no quarrel with you . '' 
Adye moistened his lips again . 
He glanced away from the barrel of the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday sun , the smooth green down , the white cliff of the Head , and the multitudinous town , and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet . 
His eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and earth , six yards away . 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
he said sullenly . 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
asked the Invisible Man . 
`` You will get help . 
The only thing is for you to go back . '' 
`` I will try . 
If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door ? '' 
`` I 've got no quarrel with you , '' said the Voice . 
Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out , and now crouching among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill , he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen . 
`` Why does n't he fire ? '' 
whispered Kemp to himself . 
Then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp 's eyes . 
He shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam . 
`` Surely ! '' 
he said , `` Adye has given up the revolver . '' 
`` Promise not to rush the door , '' Adye was saying . 
`` Do n't push a winning game too far . 
Give a man a chance . '' 
`` You go back to the house . 
I tell you flatly I will not promise anything . '' 
Adye 's decision seemed suddenly made . 
He turned towards the house , walking slowly with his hands behind him . 
Kemp watched him -- puzzled . 
The revolver vanished , flashed again into sight , vanished again , and became evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following Adye . 
Then things happened very quickly . 
Adye leapt backwards , swung around , clutched at this little object , missed it , threw up his hands and fell forward on his face , leaving a little puff of blue in the air . 
Kemp did not hear the sound of the shot . 
Adye writhed , raised himself on one arm , fell forward , and lay still . 
For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye 's attitude . 
The afternoon was very hot and still , nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate . 
Adye lay on the lawn near the gate . 
The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn , but in one little green summer-house was a white figure , apparently an old man asleep . 
Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver , but it had vanished . 
His eyes came back to Adye . 
The game was opening well . 
Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door , that grew at last tumultuous , but pursuant to Kemp 's instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms . 
This was followed by a silence . 
Kemp sat listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows , one after another . 
He went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily . 
He armed himself with his bedroom poker , and went to examine the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again . 
Everything was safe and quiet . 
He returned to the belvedere . 
Adye lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen . 
Coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen . 
Everything was deadly still . 
The three people seemed very slow in approaching .
