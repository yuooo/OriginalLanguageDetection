`` But it is only a mile from here , '' said one of the passengers . 
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . '' 
`` And ca n't we cross that in a boat ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` That 's impossible . 
The creek is swelled by the rains . 
It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . '' 
The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor ; and Passepartout , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him . 
Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his master 's banknotes could not remove . 
There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow . 
They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game . 
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true Yankee , named Forster called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . '' 
`` On the bridge ? '' 
asked a passenger . 
`` On the bridge . '' 
`` With our train ? '' 
`` With our train . '' 
Passepartout stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer . 
`` But the bridge is unsafe , '' urged the conductor . 
`` No matter , '' replied Forster ; `` I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
muttered Passepartout . 
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one . 
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind . 
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one . 
`` Eighty ! 
ninety ! '' 
Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American . 
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people ! 
Sir , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! '' 
replied the passenger , turning his back on him . 
`` I know it , '' said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . '' 
`` Doubtless , '' urged Passepartout , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What ! 
Prudent ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . 
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! '' 
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated Passepartout ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who ! 
What ! 
What 's the matter with this fellow ? '' 
cried several . 
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself . 
`` Are you afraid ? '' 
asked Colonel Proctor . 
`` I afraid ? 
Very well ; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they ! '' 
`` All aboard ! '' 
cried the conductor . 
`` Yes , all aboard ! '' 
repeated Passepartout , and immediately . 
`` But they ca n't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after ! '' 
But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice . 
The passengers resumed their places in the cars . 
Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed . 
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game . 
The locomotive whistled vigorously ; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap . 
Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second . 
They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all . 
And they passed over ! 
It was like a flash . 
No one saw the bridge . 
The train leaped , so to speak , from one bank to the other , and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station . 
But scarcely had the train passed the river , when the bridge , completely ruined , fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow . 
IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH ON AMERICAN RAILROADS The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing Fort Saunders , crossing Cheyne Pass , and reaching Evans Pass . 
The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey , eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea . 
The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains , levelled by nature . 
A branch of the `` grand trunk '' led off southward to Denver , the capital of Colorado . 
The country round about is rich in gold and silver , and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there . 
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco , in three days and three nights ; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York . 
Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand . 
During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left ; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado . 
They entered Nebraska at eleven , passed near Sedgwick , and touched at Julesburg , on the southern branch of the Platte River . 
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , General Dodge . 
Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train . 
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist . 
The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than Amphion 's lyre , was about to bid them rise from American soil . 
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha . 
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River , on its left bank . 
At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha . 
The one hundred and first meridian was passed . 
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game ; no one -- not even the dummy -- complained of the length of the trip . 
Fix had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose ; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg . 
During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman . 
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands . 
Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , `` I should play a diamond . '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix raised their heads , and beheld Colonel Proctor . 
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , is it , Englishman ? '' 
cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! '' 
`` And who plays it , '' replied Phileas Fogg coolly , throwing down the ten of spades . 
`` Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , '' replied Colonel Proctor , in an insolent tone . 
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , `` You do n't understand anything about whist . '' 
`` Perhaps I do , as well as another , '' said Phileas Fogg , rising . 
`` You have only to try , son of John Bull , '' replied the colonel . 
Aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold . 
She seized Mr. Fogg 's arm and gently pulled him back . 
Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American , who was staring insolently at his opponent . 
But Fix got up , and , going to Colonel Proctor said , `` You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only . 
The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . ''
