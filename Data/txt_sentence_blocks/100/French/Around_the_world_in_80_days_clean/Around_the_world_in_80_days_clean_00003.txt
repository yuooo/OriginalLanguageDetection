cried Stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend . 
`` Come , let 's go on with the game . '' 
`` Deal over again , then , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
`` There 's a false deal . '' 
Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand ; then suddenly put them down again . 
`` Well , Mr. Fogg , '' said he , `` it shall be so : I will wager the four thousand on it . '' 
`` Calm yourself , my dear Stuart , '' said Fallentin . 
`` It 's only a joke . '' 
`` When I say I 'll wager , '' returned Stuart , `` I mean it . '' 
`` All right , '' said Mr. Fogg ; and , turning to the others , he continued : `` I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring 's which I will willingly risk upon it . '' 
`` Twenty thousand pounds ! '' 
cried Sullivan . 
`` Twenty thousand pounds , which you would lose by a single accidental delay ! '' 
`` The unforeseen does not exist , '' quietly replied Phileas Fogg . 
`` But , Mr. Fogg , eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made . '' 
`` A well-used minimum suffices for everything . '' 
`` But , in order not to exceed it , you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers , and from the steamers upon the trains again . '' 
`` I will jump -- mathematically . '' 
`` You are joking . '' 
`` A true Englishman does n't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager , '' replied Phileas Fogg , solemnly . 
`` I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less ; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours , or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes . 
Do you accept ? '' 
`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , Fallentin , Sullivan , Flanagan , and Ralph , after consulting each other . 
`` Good , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine . 
I will take it . '' 
`` This very evening ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` This very evening , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
He took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added , `` As today is Wednesday , the 2nd of October , I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club , on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine p.m. ; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at Baring 's , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen . 
Here is a cheque for the amount . '' 
A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties , during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure . 
He certainly did not bet to win , and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds , half of his fortune , because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult , not to say unattainable , project . 
As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend . 
The clock struck seven , and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure . 
`` I am quite ready now , '' was his tranquil response . 
`` Diamonds are trumps : be so good as to play , gentlemen . '' 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT , HIS SERVANT Having won twenty guineas at whist , and taken leave of his friends , Phileas Fogg , at twenty-five minutes past seven , left the Reform Club . 
Passepartout , who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties , was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour ; for , according to rule , he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom , and called out , `` Passepartout ! '' 
Passepartout did not reply . 
It could not be he who was called ; it was not the right hour . 
`` Passepartout ! '' 
repeated Mr. Fogg , without raising his voice . 
Passepartout made his appearance . 
`` I 've called you twice , '' observed his master . 
`` But it is not midnight , '' responded the other , showing his watch . 
`` I know it ; I do n't blame you . 
We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes . '' 
A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout 's round face ; clearly he had not comprehended his master . 
`` Monsieur is going to leave home ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
`` We are going round the world . '' 
Passepartout opened wide his eyes , raised his eyebrows , held up his hands , and seemed about to collapse , so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment . 
`` Round the world ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` In eighty days , '' responded Mr. Fogg . 
`` So we have n't a moment to lose . '' 
`` But the trunks ? '' 
gasped Passepartout , unconsciously swaying his head from right to left . 
`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you . 
We 'll buy our clothes on the way . 
Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak , and some stout shoes , though we shall do little walking . 
Make haste ! '' 
Passepartout tried to reply , but could not . 
He went out , mounted to his own room , fell into a chair , and muttered : `` That 's good , that is ! 
And I , who wanted to remain quiet ! '' 
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure . 
Around the world in eighty days ! 
Was his master a fool ? 
No . 
Was this a joke , then ? 
They were going to Dover ; good ! 
To Calais ; good again ! 
After all , Passepartout , who had been away from France five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again . 
Perhaps they would go as far as Paris , and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more . 
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there ; no doubt -- but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto ! 
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself ; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to Mr. Fogg . 
Mr. Fogg was quite ready . 
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw 's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . 
He took the carpet-bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes , which would pass wherever he might go . 
`` You have forgotten nothing ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing , monsieur . '' 
`` My mackintosh and cloak ? '' 
`` Here they are . '' 
`` Good ! 
Take this carpet-bag , '' handing it to Passepartout . 
`` Take good care of it , for there are twenty thousand pounds in it . '' 
Passepartout nearly dropped the bag , as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold , and weighed him down . 
Master and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross . 
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight . 
Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms . 
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , `` Here , my good woman . 
I 'm glad that I met you ; '' and passed on . 
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart . 
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased , Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the Reform . 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . '' 
`` Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , Mr. Fogg , '' said Ralph politely . 
`` We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . ''
