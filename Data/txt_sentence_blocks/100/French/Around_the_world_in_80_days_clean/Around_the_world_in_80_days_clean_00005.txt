An English criminal , you know , is always better concealed in London than anywhere else . '' 
This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office . 
Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia . 
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . 
But Fix 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia . 
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer . 
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road . 
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay . 
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . 
Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . 
Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . 
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard . 
`` Is this your passport ? '' 
asked he . 
`` No , it 's my master 's . '' 
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . '' 
`` But he must go to the consul 's in person , so as to establish his identity . '' 
`` Oh , is that necessary ? '' 
`` Quite indispensable . '' 
`` And where is the consulate ? '' 
`` There , on the corner of the square , '' said Fix , pointing to a house two hundred steps off . 
`` I 'll go and fetch my master , who wo n't be much pleased , however , to be disturbed . '' 
The passenger bowed to Fix , and returned to the steamer . 
WHICH ONCE MORE DEMONSTRATES THE USELESSNESS OF PASSPORTS AS AIDS TO DETECTIVES The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consul 's office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official . 
`` Consul , '' said he , without preamble , `` I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia . '' 
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport . 
`` Well , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul , `` I shall not be sorry to see the rascal 's face ; but perhaps he wo n't come here -- that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be . 
A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . '' 
`` If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come . '' 
`` To have his passport visaed ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues . 
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do ; but I hope you will not visa the passport . '' 
`` Why not ? 
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse . '' 
`` Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London . '' 
`` Ah , that 's your look-out . 
But I can not -- '' The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay . 
The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it . 
The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst Fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room . 
`` You are Mr. Phileas Fogg ? '' 
said the consul , after reading the passport . 
`` I am . '' 
`` And this man is your servant ? '' 
`` He is : a Frenchman , named Passepartout . '' 
`` You are from London ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And you are going -- '' `` To Bombay . '' 
`` Very good , sir . 
You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? '' 
`` I know it , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg ; `` but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by Suez . '' 
`` Very well , sir . '' 
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal . 
Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant . 
`` Well ? '' 
queried the detective . 
`` Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , '' replied the consul . 
`` Possibly ; but that is not the question . 
Do you think , consul , that this phelgmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ? '' 
`` I concede that ; but then , you know , all descriptions -- '' `` I 'll make certain of it , '' interrupted Fix . 
`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a Frenchman , and ca n't help talking . 
Excuse me for a little while , consul . '' 
Fix started off in search of Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin . 
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` Left Paris , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` Left Turin , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158 + ; or , in days , six days and a half . '' 
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . 
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . 
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . 
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE , PERHAPS , THAN IS PRUDENT Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything . 
`` Well , my friend , '' said the detective , coming up with him , `` is your passport visaed ? '' 
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? '' 
responded Passepartout . 
`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . '' 
`` And you are looking about you ? '' 
`` Yes ; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream . 
So this is Suez ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` In Egypt ? '' 
`` Certainly , in Egypt . '' 
`` And in Africa ? '' 
`` In Africa . '' 
`` In Africa ! '' 
repeated Passepartout . 
`` Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris ; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the Northern and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain ! 
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees ! '' 
`` You are in a great hurry , then ? '' 
`` I am not , but my master is . 
By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts . 
We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag . '' 
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . '' 
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . '' 
And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along . 
`` Above all , '' said he ; `` do n't let me lose the steamer . '' 
`` You have plenty of time ; it 's only twelve o'clock . '' 
Passepartout pulled out his big watch . 
`` Twelve ! '' 
he exclaimed ; `` why , it 's only eight minutes before ten . '' 
`` Your watch is slow . '' 
`` My watch ?
