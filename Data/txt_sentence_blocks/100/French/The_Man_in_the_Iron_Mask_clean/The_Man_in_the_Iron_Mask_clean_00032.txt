`` Very good , sire , '' replied the captain , whose glance had for a long time past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance . 
He gave the necessary order at the door ; but , returning to the king , he said , `` Is there something fresh the matter , your majesty ? '' 
`` How many men have you here ? '' 
inquired the king , without making any other reply to the question addressed to him . 
`` What for , sire ? '' 
`` How many men have you , I say ? '' 
repeated the king , stamping upon the ground with his foot . 
`` I have the musketeers . '' 
`` Well ; and what others ? '' 
`` Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss . '' 
`` How many men will be required to - '' `` To do what , sire ? '' 
replied the musketeer , opening his large , calm eyes . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan fell back a step . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet ! '' 
he burst forth . 
`` Are you going to tell me that it is impossible ? '' 
exclaimed the king , in tones of cold , vindictive passion . 
`` I never say that anything is impossible , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the quick . 
`` Very well ; do it , then . '' 
D'Artagnan turned on his heel , and made his way towards the door ; it was but a short distance , and he cleared it in half a dozen paces ; when he reached it he suddenly paused , and said , `` Your majesty will forgive me , but , in order to effect this arrest , I should like written directions . '' 
`` For what purpose - and since when has the king 's word been insufficient for you ? '' 
`` Because the word of a king , when it springs from a feeling of anger , may possibly change when the feeling changes . '' 
`` A truce to set phrases , monsieur ; you have another thought besides that ? '' 
`` Oh , I , at least , have certain thoughts and ideas , which , unfortunately , others have not , '' D'Artagnan replied , impertinently . 
The king , in the tempest of his wrath , hesitated , and drew back in the face of D'Artagnan 's frank courage , just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider . 
`` What is your thought ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan : `` you cause a man to be arrested when you are still under his roof ; and passion is alone the cause of that . 
When your anger shall have passed , you will regret what you have done ; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature . 
If that , however , should fail to be a reparation , it will at least show us that the king was wrong to lose his temper . '' 
`` Wrong to lose his temper ! '' 
cried the king , in a loud , passionate voice . 
`` Did not my father , my grandfathers , too , before me , lose their temper at times , in Heaven 's name ? '' 
`` The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their temper except when under the protection of their own palace . '' 
`` The king is master wherever he may be . '' 
`` That is a flattering , complimentary phrase which can not proceed from any one but M. Colbert ; but it happens not to be the truth . 
The king is at home in every man 's house when he has driven its owner out of it . '' 
The king bit his lips , but said nothing . 
`` Can it be possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan ; `` here is a man who is positively ruining himself in order to please you , and you wish to have him arrested ! 
Mordioux ! 
Sire , if my name was Fouquet , and people treated me in that manner , I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of fireworks and other things , and I would set fire to them , and send myself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky . 
But it is all the same ; it is your wish , and it shall be done . '' 
`` Go , '' said the king ; `` but have you men enough ? '' 
`` Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me ? 
Arrest M. Fouquet ! 
why , that is so easy that a very child might do it ! 
It is like drinking a glass of wormwood ; one makes an ugly face , and that is all . '' 
`` If he defends himself ? '' 
`` He ! 
it is not at all likely . 
Defend himself when such extreme harshness as you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr ! 
Nay , I am sure that if he has a million of francs left , which I very much doubt , he would be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination as this . 
But what does that matter ? 
it shall be done at once . '' 
`` Stay , '' said the king ; `` do not make his arrest a public affair . '' 
`` That will be more difficult . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of a thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him , and say , ` In the king 's name , I arrest you . ' 
But to go up to him , to turn him first one way and then another , to drive him up into one of the corners of the chess-board , in such a way that he can not escape ; to take him away from his guests , and keep him a prisoner for you , without one of them , alas ! 
having heard anything about it ; that , indeed , is a genuine difficulty , the greatest of all , in truth ; and I hardly see how it is to be done . '' 
`` You had better say it is impossible , and you will have finished much sooner . 
Heaven help me , but I seem to be surrounded by people who prevent me doing what I wish . '' 
`` I do not prevent your doing anything . 
Have you indeed decided ? '' 
`` Take care of M. Fouquet , until I shall have made up my mind by to-morrow morning . '' 
`` That shall be done , sire . '' 
`` And return , when I rise in the morning , for further orders ; and now leave me to myself . '' 
`` You do not even want M. Colbert , then ? '' 
said the musketeer , firing his last shot as he was leaving the room . 
The king started . 
With his whole mind fixed on the thought of revenge , he had forgotten the cause and substance of the offense . 
`` No , no one , '' he said ; `` no one here ! 
Leave me . '' 
D'Artagnan quitted the room . 
The king closed the door with his own hands , and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace , like a wounded bull in an arena , trailing from his horn the colored streamers and the iron darts . 
At last he began to take comfort in the expression of his violent feelings . 
`` Miserable wretch that he is ! 
not only does he squander my finances , but with his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries , friends , generals , artists , and all , and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most attached . 
This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took his part ! 
Gratitude ! 
and who can tell whether it was not a stronger feeling - love itself ? '' 
He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest reflections . 
`` A satyr ! '' 
he thought , with that abhorrent hate with which young men regard those more advanced in life , who still think of love . 
`` A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one , who lavishes his gold and jewels in every direction , and who retains his staff of painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses in the costume of goddesses . '' 
The king trembled with passion as he continued , `` He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs to me ! 
He destroys everything that is mine . 
He will be my death at last , I know . 
That man is too much for me ; he is my mortal enemy , but he shall forthwith fall ! 
I hate him - I hate him - I hate him ! '' 
and as he pronounced these words , he struck the arm of the chair in which he was sitting violently , over and over again , and then rose like one in an epileptic fit . 
`` To-morrow ! 
to-morrow ! 
oh , happy day ! '' 
he murmured , `` when the sun rises , no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess but me . 
That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject ruin my anger shall have wrought , they will be forced to confess at last and at least that I am indeed greater than he . '' 
The king , who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer , knocked over with a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside , and in the very bitterness of anger , almost weeping , and half-suffocated , he threw himself on his bed , dressed as he was , and bit the sheets in his extremity of passion , trying to find repose of body at least there . 
The bed creaked beneath his weight , and with the exception of a few broken sounds , emerging , or , one might say , exploding , from his overburdened chest , absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus .
