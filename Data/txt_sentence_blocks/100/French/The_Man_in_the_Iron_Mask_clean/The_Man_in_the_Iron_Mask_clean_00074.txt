`` And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne , and not us . '' 
`` But , mark this well , M. Colbert . 
M. d'Herblay is never discouraged ; if he has missed one blow , he will be sure to make another ; he will begin again . 
If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for himself , sooner or later , he will make another , of whom , to a certainty , you will not be prime minister . '' 
Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression . 
`` I feel assured that a prison will settle this affair for us , madame , in a manner satisfactory for both . '' 
The duchesse smiled again . 
`` Oh ! 
if you knew , '' said she , `` how many times Aramis has got out of prison ! '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied Colbert , `` we will take care that he shall not get out this time . '' 
`` But you were not attending to what I said to you just now . 
Do you remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so dreaded ? 
And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and experience . '' 
Colbert bit his lips . 
`` We will renounce the idea of the prison , '' said he , in a lower tone : `` we will find a little retreat from which the invincible can not possibly escape . '' 
`` That was well spoken , our ally ! '' 
replied the duchesse . 
`` But it is getting late ; had we not better return ? '' 
`` The more willingly , madame , from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king . '' 
`` To Paris ! '' 
cried the duchesse to the coachman . 
And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine , after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet , the last defender of Belle-Isle , the former friend of Marie Michon , the new foe of the old duchesse . 
: The Two Lighters . 
D'Artagnan had set off ; Fouquet likewise was gone , and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends . 
The first moments of this journey , or better say , this flight , were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive . 
It was not natural , in fact , if Louis XIV . 
was determined to seize this prey , that he should allow it to escape ; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase , and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted . 
But insensibly all fears were dispersed ; the surintendant , by hard traveling , placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors , that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him . 
As to his position , his friends had made it excellent for him . 
Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy . 
The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port . 
You see , besides , that no one is watching you , no one is following . '' 
He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance , behind an elbow formed by the river , the masts of a huge lighter coming down . 
The rowers of Fouquet 's boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` The matter is , monseigneur , '' replied the patron of the bark , `` that it is a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane . '' 
Gourville started , and mounted to the deck , in order to obtain a better view . 
Fouquet did not go up with him , but said to Gourville , with restrained mistrust : `` See what it is , dear friend . '' 
The lighter had just passed the elbow . 
It came on so fast , that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day . 
`` How they go , '' repeated the skipper , `` how they go ! 
They must be well paid ! 
I did not think , '' he added , `` that oars of wood could behave better than ours , but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary . '' 
`` Well they may , '' said one of the rowers , `` they are twelve , and we but eight . '' 
`` Twelve rowers ! '' 
replied Gourville , `` twelve ! 
impossible . '' 
The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded , even for the king . 
This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant , more for the sake of haste than of respect . 
`` What does it mean ? '' 
said Gourville , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent , which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering . 
`` They must be in a hurry , for it is not the king , '' said the patron . 
Fouquet shuddered . 
`` By what sign do you know that it is not the king ? '' 
said Gourville . 
`` In the first place , because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis , which the royal lighter always carries . '' 
`` And then , '' said Fouquet , `` because it is impossible it should be the king , Gourville , as the king was still in Paris yesterday . '' 
Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said : `` You were there yourself yesterday . '' 
`` And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste ? '' 
added he , for the sake of gaining time . 
`` By this , monsieur , '' said the patron ; `` these people must have set out a long while after us , and they have already nearly overtaken us . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Gourville , `` who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even ? '' 
`` We have seen no lighter of that shape , except at Orleans . 
It comes from Orleans , monsieur , and makes great haste . '' 
Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! '' 
`` No , '' said Fouquet , `` on the contrary ; stop short . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
what folly ! '' 
interrupted Gourville , stooping towards his ear . 
`` Pull up ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
The eight oars stopped , and resisting the water , created a retrograde motion . 
It stopped . 
The twelve rowers in the other did not , at first , perceive this maneuver , for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket - shot . 
Fouquet was short-sighted , Gourville was annoyed by the sun , now full in his eyes ; the skipper alone , with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements , perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter . 
`` I can see them ! '' 
cried he ; `` there are two . '' 
`` I can see nothing , '' said Gourville . 
`` You will not be long before you distinguish them ; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us . '' 
But what the patron announced was not realized ; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet , and instead of coming to join its pretended friends , it stopped short in the middle of the river . 
`` I can not comprehend this , '' said the captain . 
`` Nor I , '' cried Gourville . 
`` You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter , '' resumed Fouquet , `` try to describe them to us , before we are too far off . '' 
`` I thought I saw two , '' replied the boatman . 
`` I can only see one now , under the tent . ''
