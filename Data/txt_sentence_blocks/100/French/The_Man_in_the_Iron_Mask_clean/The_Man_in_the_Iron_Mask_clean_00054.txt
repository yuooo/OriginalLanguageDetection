`` Oh ! 
I have no fear on that score . 
One word more : do you think I am maneuvering for him as I ought ? '' 
`` The evil being committed , yes ; for the king would not pardon him , and you have , whatever may be said , always a supporter in M. Fouquet , who will not abandon you , he being himself compromised , notwithstanding his heroic action . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that is why , instead of gaining the sea at once , which would proclaim my fear and guilt , that is why I remain upon French ground . 
But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be , English , Spanish , or Roman ; all will depend , with me , on the standard I shall think proper to unfurl . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` It was I who fortified Belle-Isle ; and , so long as I defend it , nobody can take Belle-Isle from me . 
And then , as you have said just now , M. Fouquet is there . 
Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` That is true . 
Nevertheless , be prudent . 
The king is both cunning and strong . '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` I again recommend Porthos to you , '' repeated the count , with a sort of cold persistence . 
`` Whatever becomes of me , count , '' replied Aramis , in the same tone , `` our brother Porthos will fare as I do - or better . '' 
Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis , and turned to embrace Porthos with emotion . 
`` I was born lucky , was I not ? '' 
murmured the latter , transported with happiness , as he folded his cloak round him . 
`` Come , my dear friend , '' said Aramis . 
Raoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses . 
The group was already divided . 
Athos saw his two friends on the point of departure , and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed upon his heart . 
`` It is strange , '' thought he , `` whence comes the inclination I feel to embrace Porthos once more ? '' 
At that moment Porthos turned round , and he came towards his old friend with open arms . 
This last endearment was tender as in youth , as in times when hearts were warm - life happy . 
And then Porthos mounted his horse . 
Aramis came back once more to throw his arms round the neck of Athos . 
The latter watched them along the high - road , elongated by the shade , in their white cloaks . 
Like phantoms they seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth , and it was not in the mist , but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared . 
At the end of the perspective , both seemed to have given a spring with their feet , which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land . 
Then Athos , with a very heavy heart , returned towards the house , saying to Bragelonne , `` Raoul , I do n't know what it is that has just told me that I have seen those two for the last time . '' 
`` It does not astonish me , monsieur , that you should have such a thought , '' replied the young man , `` for I have at this moment the same , and think also that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d'Herblay again . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you , '' replied the count , `` you speak like a man rendered sad by a different cause ; you see everything in black ; you are young , and if you chance never to see those old friends again , it will because they no longer exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass . 
But I - '' Raoul shook his head sadly , and leaned upon the shoulder of the count , without either of them finding another word in their hearts , which were ready to overflow . 
All at once a noise of horses and voices , from the extremity of the road to Blois , attracted their attention that way . 
Flambeaux-bearers shook their torches merrily among the trees of their route , and turned round , from time to time , to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them . 
These flames , this noise , this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned horses , formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the melancholy and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of Aramis and Porthos . 
Athos went towards the house ; but he had hardly reached the parterre , when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze ; all the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road . 
A cry was heard of `` M. le Duc de Beaufort '' - and Athos sprang towards the door of his house . 
But the duke had already alighted from his horse , and was looking around him . 
`` I am here , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Ah ! 
good evening , dear count , '' said the prince , with that frank cordiality which won him so many hearts . 
`` Is it too late for a friend ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear prince , come in ! '' 
said the count . 
And , M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos , they entered the house , followed by Raoul , who walked respectfully and modestly among the officers of the prince , with several of whom he was acquainted . 
: Monsieur de Beaufort . 
The prince turned round at the moment when Raoul , in order to leave him alone with Athos , was shutting the door , and preparing to go with the other officers into an adjoining apartment . 
`` Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of ? '' 
asked M. de Beaufort . 
`` It is , monseigneur . '' 
`` He is quite the soldier ; let him stay , count , we can not spare him . '' 
`` Remain , Raoul , since monseigneur permits it , '' said Athos . 
`` Ma foi ! 
he is tall and handsome ! '' 
continued the duke . 
`` Will you give him to me , monseigneur , if I ask him of you ? '' 
`` How am I to understand you , monseigneur ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Why , I call upon you to bid you farewell . '' 
`` Farewell ! '' 
`` Yes , in good truth . 
Have you no idea of what I am about to become ? '' 
`` Why , I suppose , what you have always been , monseigneur , - a valiant prince , and an excellent gentleman . '' 
`` I am going to become an African prince , - a Bedouin gentleman . 
The king is sending me to make conquests among the Arabs . '' 
`` What is this you tell me , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Strange , is it not ? 
I , the Parisian par essence , I who have reigned in the faubourgs , and have been called King of the Halles , - I am going to pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli ; from a Frondeur I am becoming an adventurer ! '' 
`` Oh , monseigneur , if you did not yourself tell me that - '' `` It would not be credible , would it ? 
Believe me , nevertheless , and we have but to bid each other farewell . 
This is what comes of getting into favor again . '' 
`` Into favor ? '' 
`` Yes . 
You smile . 
Ah , my dear count , do you know why I have accepted this enterprise , can you guess ? '' 
`` Because your highness loves glory above - everything . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no ; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages . 
I see no glory in that , for my part , and it is more probable that I shall there meet with something else . 
But I have wished , and still wish earnestly , my dear count , that my life should have that last facet , after all the whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years . 
For , in short , you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born the grandson of a king , to have made war against kings , to have been reckoned among the powers of the age , to have maintained my rank , to feel Henry IV . 
within me , to be great admiral of France - and then to go and get killed at Gigelli , among all those Turks , Saracens , and Moors . '' 
`` Monseigneur , you harp with strange persistence on that theme , '' said Athos , in an agitated voice . 
`` How can you suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene ? '' 
`` And can you believe , upright and simple as you are , that if I go into Africa for this ridiculous motive , I will not endeavor to come out of it without ridicule ? 
Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me ? 
And to be spoken of , nowadays , when there are Monsieur le Prince , M. de Turenne , and many others , my contemporaries , I , admiral of France , grandson of Henry IV. , king of Paris , have I anything left but to get myself killed ? 
Cordieu ! 
I will be talked of , I tell you ; I shall be killed whether or not ; if no there , somewhere else . '' 
`` Why , monseigneur , this is mere exaggeration ; and hitherto you have shown nothing exaggerated save in bravery . '' 
`` Peste ! 
my dear friend , there is bravery in facing scurvy , dysentery , locusts , poisoned arrows , as my ancestor St. Louis did . 
Do you know those fellows still use poisoned arrows ? 
And then , you know me of old , I fancy , and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing , I perform it in grim earnest . ''
