Boats , laden with soldiers , were seen approaching ; and in three directions , for the purpose of landing at three points at once . 
`` What must be done ? '' 
said an officer of the guard . 
`` Stop them ; and if they persist , fire ! '' 
said Aramis . 
Five minutes later , the cannonade commenced . 
These were the shots that D'Artagnan had heard as he landed in France . 
But the boats were too near the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly . 
They landed , and the combat commenced hand to hand . 
`` What 's the matter , Porthos ? '' 
said Aramis to his friend . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
- only my legs ; it is really incomprehensible ! 
- they will be better when we charge . '' 
In fact , Porthos and Aramis did charge with such vigor , and so thoroughly animated their men , that the royalists re-embarked precipitately , without gaining anything but the wounds they carried away . 
`` Eh ! 
but Porthos , '' cried Aramis , `` we must have a prisoner , quick ! 
quick ! '' 
Porthos bent over the stair of the mole , and seized by the nape of the neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to embark till all his people should be in the boat . 
The arm of the giant lifted up his prey , which served him as a buckler , and he recovered himself without a shot being fired at him . 
`` Here is a prisoner for you , '' said Porthos coolly to Aramis . 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the latter , laughing , `` did you not calumniate your legs ? '' 
`` It was not with my legs I captured him , '' said Porthos , `` it was with my arms ! '' 
: The Son of Biscarrat . 
The Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory ; Aramis did not encourage them in the feeling . 
`` What will happen , '' said he to Porthos , when everybody was gone home , `` will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the resistance ; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when they are taken , which can not fail to take place . '' 
`` From which it results , then , '' said Porthos , `` that what we have done is of not the slightest use . '' 
`` For the moment it may be , '' replied the bishop , `` for we have a prisoner from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do . '' 
`` Yes , let us interrogate the prisoner , '' said Porthos , `` and the means of making him speak are very simple . 
We are going to supper ; we will invite him to join us ; as he drinks he will talk . '' 
This was done . 
The officer was at first rather uneasy , but became reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with . 
He gave , without having any fear of compromising himself , all the details imaginable of the resignation and departure of D'Artagnan . 
He explained how , after that departure , the new leader of the expedition had ordered a surprise upon Belle-Isle . 
There his explanations stopped . 
Aramis and Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair . 
No more dependence to be placed now on D'Artagnan 's fertile imagination - no further resource in the event of defeat . 
Aramis , continuing his interrogations , asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle . 
`` The orders are , '' replied he , `` to kill during combat , or hang afterwards . '' 
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other again , and the color mounted to their faces . 
`` I am too light for the gallows , '' replied Aramis ; `` people like me are not hung . '' 
`` And I am too heavy , '' said Porthos ; `` people like me break the cord . '' 
`` I am sure , '' said the prisoner , gallantly , `` that we could have guaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred . '' 
`` A thousand thanks ! '' 
said Aramis , seriously . 
Porthos bowed . 
`` One more cup of wine to your health , '' said he , drinking himself . 
From one subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged . 
He was an intelligent gentleman , and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of Aramis 's wit and Porthos 's cordial bonhomie . 
`` Pardon me , '' said he , `` if I address a question to you ; but men who are in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little . '' 
`` Address it ! '' 
cried Porthos ; `` address it ! '' 
`` Speak , '' said Aramis . 
`` Were you not , gentlemen , both in the musketeers of the late king ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , and amongst the best of them , if you please , '' said Porthos . 
`` That is true ; I should say even the best of all soldiers , messieurs , if I did not fear to offend the memory of my father . '' 
`` Of your father ? '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` Do you know what my name is ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
no , monsieur ; but you can tell us , and - '' `` I am called Georges de Biscarrat . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Do you remember that name , Aramis ? '' 
`` Biscarrat ! '' 
reflected the bishop . 
`` It seems to me - '' `` Try to recollect , monsieur , '' said the officer . 
`` Pardieu ! 
that wo n't take me long , '' said Porthos . 
`` Biscarrat - called Cardinal - one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we formed our friendship with D'Artagnan , sword in hand . '' 
`` Precisely , gentlemen . '' 
`` The only one , '' cried Aramis , eagerly , `` we could not scratch . '' 
`` Consequently , a capital blade ? '' 
said the prisoner . 
`` That 's true ! 
most true ! '' 
exclaimed both friends together . 
`` Ma foi ! 
Monsieur Biscarrat , we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a brave man 's son . '' 
Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers . 
Aramis looked at Porthos as much as to say , `` Here is a man who will help us , '' and without delay , - `` Confess , monsieur , '' said he , `` that it is good to have once been a good man . '' '' 
`` My father always said so , monsieur . '' 
`` Confess , likewise , that it is a sad circumstance in which you find yourself , of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung , and to learn that these men are old acquaintances , in fact , hereditary friends . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that , messieurs and friends ! '' 
said the young man , warmly . 
`` Bah ! 
you said so yourself . '' 
`` I said so just now , when I did not know you ; but now that I know you , I say - you will evade this dismal fate , if you wish ! '' 
`` How - if we wish ? '' 
echoed Aramis , whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos . 
`` Provided , '' continued Porthos , looking , in his turn , with noble intrepidity , at M. Biscarrat and the bishop - `` provided nothing disgraceful be required of us . '' 
`` Nothing at all will be required of you , gentlemen , '' replied the officer - `` what should they ask of you ? 
If they find you they will kill you , that is a predetermined thing ; try , then , gentlemen , to prevent their finding you . '' 
`` I do n't think I am mistaken , '' said Porthos , with dignity ; `` but it appears evident to me that if they want to find us , they must come and seek us here . '' 
`` In that you are perfectly right , my worthy friend , '' replied Aramis , constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat , who had grown silent and constrained . 
`` You wish , Monsieur de Biscarrat , to say something to us , to make us some overture , and you dare not - is that true ? ''
