I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of ink . '' 
`` No , there is no ink ; no , there is no blot . '' 
`` Oh ! 
but there was , though ; I know it , because I rubbed my finger - this very one - in the powder that was over the blot . '' 
`` In a word , be it how it may , dear M. Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , `` and whatever you may have seen , the order is signed to release Marchiali , blot or no blot . '' 
`` The order is signed to release Marchiali , '' replied Baisemeaux , mechanically , endeavoring to regain his courage . 
`` And you are going to release this prisoner . 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also , I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in the world . '' 
Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile , the irony of which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux 's confusion of mind , and restored his courage . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he said , `` this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a priest confessor of our order came to visit in so imperious and so secret a manner . '' 
`` I do n't know that , monsieur , '' replied the bishop . '' 
'T is no such long time ago , dear Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` It is true . 
But with us , monsieur , it is good that the man of to-day should no longer know what the man of yesterday did . '' 
`` In any case , '' said Baisemeaux , `` the visit of the Jesuit confessor must have given happiness to this man . '' 
Aramis made no reply , but recommenced eating and drinking . 
As for Baisemeaux , no longer touching anything that was on the table , he again took up the order and examined it every way . 
This investigation , under ordinary circumstances , would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis burn with anger ; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so little , above all , when he had murmured to himself that to do so was dangerous . 
`` Are you going to release Marchiali ? '' 
he said . 
`` What mellow , fragrant and delicious sherry this is , my dear governor . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Baisemeaux , `` I shall release the prisoner Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order , and above all , when , by interrogating him , I have satisfied myself . '' 
`` The order is sealed , and the courier is ignorant of the contents . 
What do you want to satisfy yourself about ? '' 
`` Be it so , monseigneur ; but I shall send to the ministry , and M. de Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order . '' 
`` What is the good of all that ? '' 
asked Aramis , coldly . 
`` What good ? '' 
`` Yes ; what is your object , I ask ? '' 
`` The object of never deceiving oneself , monseigneur ; nor being wanting in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers , nor infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one 's own free will . '' 
`` Very good ; you have just spoken so eloquently , that I can not but admire you . 
It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors ; he is guilty when he deceives himself , and he should be punished if he infringed either the duties or laws of his office . '' 
Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment . 
`` It follows , '' pursued Aramis , `` that you are going to ask advice , to put your conscience at ease in the matter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And if a superior officer gives you orders , you will obey ? '' 
`` Never doubt it , monseigneur . '' 
`` You know the king 's signature well , M. de Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Is it not on this order of release ? '' 
`` It is true , but it may - '' `` Be forged , you mean ? '' 
`` That is evident , monseigneur . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` I see it plain enough on the order ; but for the same reason that the king 's signature may have been forged , so also , and with even greater probability , may M. de Lyonne 's . '' 
`` Your logic has the stride of a giant , M. de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and your reasoning is irresistible . 
But on what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are false ? '' 
`` On this : the absence of counter-signatures . 
Nothing checks his majesty 's signature ; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has signed . '' 
`` Well , Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , bending an eagle glance on the governor , `` I adopt so frankly your doubts , and your mode of clearing them up , that I will take a pen , if you will give me one . '' 
Baisemeaux gave him a pen . 
`` And a sheet of white paper , '' added Aramis . 
Baisemeaux handed him some paper . 
`` Now , I - I , also - I , here present - incontestably , I - am going to write an order to which I am certain you will give credence , incredulous as you are ! '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner . 
It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop 's , but just now so playful and gay , had become funereal and sad ; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel , the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood . 
Aramis took a pen and wrote . 
Baisemeaux , in terror , read over his shoulder . 
`` A. M. D. G. , '' wrote the bishop ; and he drew a cross under these four letters , which signify ad majorem Dei gloriam , `` to the greater glory of God ; '' and thus he continued : `` It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun , governor , for the king , of the castle of the Bastile , be held by him good and effectual , and be immediately carried into operation . '' 
-LRB- Signed -RRB- D'HERBLAY `` General of the Order , by the grace of God . '' 
Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished , that his features remained contracted , his lips parted , and his eyes fixed . 
He did not move an inch , nor articulate a sound . 
Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth , which was fluttering to its death about the candles . 
Aramis , without even deigning to look at the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition , drew from his pocket a small case of black wax ; he sealed the letter , and stamped it with a seal suspended at his breast , beneath his doublet , and when the operation was concluded , presented - still in silence - the missive to M. de Baisemeaux . 
The latter , whose hands trembled in a manner to excite pity , turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter . 
A last gleam of feeling played over his features , and he fell , as if thunder-struck , on a chair . 
`` Come , come , '' said Aramis , after a long silence , during which the governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses , `` do not lead me to believe , dear Baisemeaux , that the presence of the general of the order is as terrible as His , and that men die merely from having seen Him . 
Take courage , rouse yourself ; give me your hand - obey . '' 
Baisemeaux , reassured , if not satisfied , obeyed , kissed Aramis 's hand , and rose . 
`` Immediately ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` Oh , there is no pressing haste , my host ; take your place again , and do the honors over this beautiful dessert . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I shall never recover such a shock as this ; I who have laughed , who have jested with you ! 
I who have dared to treat you on a footing of equality ! '' 
`` Say nothing about it , old comrade , '' replied the bishop , who perceived how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it ; `` say nothing about it . 
Let us each live in our own way ; to you , my protection and my friendship ; to me , your obedience . 
Having exactly fulfilled these two requirements , let us live happily . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected ; he perceived , at a glance , the consequence of this withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order ; and , putting in the scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general , did not consider it of any value . 
Aramis divined this . 
`` My dear Baisemeaux , '' said he , `` you are a simpleton . 
Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to think for you . '' 
And at another gesture he made , Baisemeaux bowed again . 
`` How shall I set about it ? '' 
he said . 
`` What is the process for releasing a prisoner ? '' 
`` I have the regulations . '' 
`` Well , then , follow the regulations , my friend . '' 
`` I go with my major to the prisoner 's room , and conduct him , if he is a personage of importance . '' 
`` But this Marchiali is not an important personage , '' said Aramis carelessly . 
`` I do n't know , '' answered the governor , as if he would have said , `` It is for you to instruct me . '' 
`` Then if you do n't know it , I am right ; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards one of obscure station . '' 
`` Good ; the regulations so provide . 
They are to the effect that the turnkey , or one of the lower officials , shall bring the prisoner before the governor , in the office . '' 
`` Well , 't is very wise , that ; and then ? '' 
`` Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his imprisonment , his clothes and papers , if the minister 's orders have not otherwise dictated . '' 
`` What was the minister 's order as to this Marchiali ? '' 
`` Nothing ; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels , without papers , and almost without clothes . '' 
`` See how simple , then , all is . 
Indeed , Baisemeaux , you make a mountain of everything . 
Remain here , and make them bring the prisoner to the governor 's house . ''
