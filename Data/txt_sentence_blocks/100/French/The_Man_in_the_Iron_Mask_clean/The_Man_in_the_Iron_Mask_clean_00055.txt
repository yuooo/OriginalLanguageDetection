`` Yes , you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes . '' 
`` Ay , but you aided me in that , my master ; and , a propos , I turn this way and that , without seeing my old friend , M. Vaugrimaud . 
How is he ? '' 
`` M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness 's most respectful servant , '' said Athos , smiling . 
`` I have a hundred pistoles here for him , which I bring as a legacy . 
My will is made , count . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` And you may understand that if Grimaud 's name were to appear in my will - '' The duke began to laugh ; then addressing Raoul , who , from the commencement of this conversation , had sunk into a profound reverie , `` Young man , '' said he , `` I know there is to be found here a certain De Vouvray wine , and I believe - '' Raoul left the room precipitately to order the wine . 
In the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos . 
`` What do you mean to do with him ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing at present , monseigneur . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , I know ; since the passion of the king for La Valliere . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` That is all true , then , is it ? 
I think I know her , that little La Valliere . 
She is not particularly handsome , if I remember right ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Do you know whom she reminds me of ? '' 
`` Does she remind your highness of any one ? '' 
`` She reminds me of a very agreeable girl , whose mother lived in the Halles . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
said Athos , smiling . 
`` Oh ! 
the good old times , '' added M. de Beaufort . 
`` Yes , La Valliere reminds me of that girl . '' 
`` Who had a son , had she not ? '' 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- `` I believe she had , '' replied the duke , with careless naivete and a complaisant forgetfulness , of which no words could translate the tone and the vocal expression . 
`` Now , here is poor Raoul , who is your son , I believe . '' 
`` Yes , he is my son , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the poor lad has been cut out by the king , and he frets . '' 
`` Still better , monseigneur , he abstains . '' 
`` You are going to let the boy rust in idleness ; it is a mistake . 
Come , give him to me . '' 
`` My wish is to keep him at home , monseigneur . 
I have no longer anything in the world but him , and as long as he likes to remain - '' `` Well , well , '' replied the duke . 
`` I could , nevertheless , have soon put matters to rights again . 
I assure you , I think he has in him the stuff of which marechals of France are made ; I have seen more than one produced from less likely rough material . '' 
`` That is very possible , monseigneur ; but it is the king who makes marechals of France , and Raoul will never accept anything of the king . '' 
Raoul interrupted this conversation by his return . 
He preceded Grimaud , whose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle of the duke 's favorite wine . 
On seeing his old protege , the duke uttered an exclamation of pleasure . 
`` Grimaud ! 
Good evening , Grimaud ! '' 
said he ; `` how goes it ? '' 
The servant bowed profoundly , as much gratified as his noble interlocutor . 
`` Two old friends ! '' 
said the duke , shaking honest Grimaud 's shoulder after a vigorous fashion ; which was followed by another still more profound and delighted bow from Grimaud . 
`` But what is this , count , only one glass ? '' 
`` I should not think of drinking with your highness , unless your highness permitted me , '' replied Athos , with noble humility . 
`` Cordieu ! 
you were right to bring only one glass , we will both drink out of it , like two brothers in arms . 
Begin , count . '' 
`` Do me the honor , '' said Athos , gently putting back the glass . 
`` You are a charming friend , '' replied the Duc de Beaufort , who drank , and passed the goblet to his companion . 
`` But that is not all , '' continued he , `` I am still thirsty , and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man who stands here . 
I carry good luck with me , vicomte , '' said he to Raoul ; `` wish for something while drinking out of my glass , and may the black plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass ! '' 
He held the goblet to Raoul , who hastily moistened his lips , and replied with the same promptitude : `` I have wished for something , monseigneur . '' 
His eyes sparkled with a gloomy fire , and the blood mounted to his cheeks ; he terrified Athos , if only with his smile . 
`` And what have you wished for ? '' 
replied the duke , sinking back into his fauteuil , whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud , and with the other gave him a purse . 
`` Will you promise me , monseigneur , to grant me what I wish for ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
That is agreed upon . '' 
`` I wished , monsieur le duc , to go with you to Gigelli . '' 
Athos became pale , and was unable to conceal his agitation . 
The duke looked at his friend , as if desirous to assist him to parry this unexpected blow . 
`` That is difficult , my dear vicomte , very difficult , '' added he , in a lower tone of voice . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , I have been indiscreet , '' replied Raoul , in a firm voice ; `` but as you yourself invited me to wish - '' `` To wish to leave me ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur - can you imagine - '' `` Well , mordieu ! '' 
cried the duke , `` the young vicomte is right ! 
What can he do here ? 
He will go moldy with grief . '' 
Raoul blushed , and the excitable prince continued : `` War is a distraction : we gain everything by it ; we can only lose one thing by it - life - then so much the worse ! '' 
`` That is to say , memory , '' said Raoul , eagerly ; `` and that is to say , so much the better ! '' 
He repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open the window ; which was , doubtless , to conceal his emotion . 
Raoul sprang towards the comte , but the latter had already overcome his emotion , and turned to the lights with a serene and impassible countenance . 
`` Well , come , '' said the duke , `` let us see ! 
Shall he go , or shall he not ? 
If he goes , comte , he shall be my aide-de-camp , my son . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Raoul , bending his knee . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , taking the hand of the duke ; `` Raoul shall do just as he likes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , monsieur , just as you like , '' interrupted the young man . 
`` Par la corbleu ! '' 
said the prince in his turn , `` it is neither the comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way , it is I. I will take him away . 
The marine offers a superb fortune , my friend . '' 
Raoul smiled again so sadly , that this time Athos felt his heart penetrated by it , and replied to him by a severe look . 
Raoul comprehended it all ; he recovered his calmness , and was so guarded , that not another word escaped him . 
The duke at length rose , on observing the advanced hour , and said , with animation , `` I am in great haste , but if I am told I have lost time in talking with a friend , I will reply I have gained - on the balance - a most excellent recruit . '' 
`` Pardon me , monsieur le duc , '' interrupted Raoul , `` do not tell the king so , for it is not the king I wish to serve . '' 
`` Eh !
