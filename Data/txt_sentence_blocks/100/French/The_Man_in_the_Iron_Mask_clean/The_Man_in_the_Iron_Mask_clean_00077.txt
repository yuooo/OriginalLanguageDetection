`` All that is not to be put into execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes . 
So that you see plainly , monseigneur , the order in nowise concerns you . '' 
Fouquet became thoughtful , and D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation . 
`` It is evident , by my thus confiding to you the orders which have been given to me , that I am friendly towards you , and that I am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you . '' 
`` Without doubt ! 
- without doubt ! '' 
said Fouquet , still absent . 
`` Let us recapitulate , '' said the captain , his glance beaming with earnestness . 
`` A special guard about the castle , in which your lodging is to be , is it not ? '' 
`` Do you know the castle ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment . 
He had not reached the steps of the vestibule , when Fouquet , quite beside himself , hung to the bell-rope , and shouted , `` My horses ! 
- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale . 
`` Let us be gone ! 
Let us be gone ! '' 
cried Fouquet , as soon as he saw him . 
`` It is too late ! '' 
said the surintendant 's poor friend . 
`` Too late ! 
- why ? '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the castle . 
`` What does that mean , Gourville ? '' 
`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup . 
D'Artagnan , when the king had passed under the arch , directed his steps towards the house Fouquet was in ; but so slowly , and stopping so frequently to speak to his musketeers , drawn up like a hedge , that it might be said he was counting the seconds , or the steps , before accomplishing his object . 
Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the court . 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , on perceiving him , `` are you still there , monseigneur ? '' 
And that word still completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had paid him . 
The surintendant sighed deeply . 
`` Good heavens ! 
yes , monsieur , '' replied he . 
`` The arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed . '' 
`` Oh , then you know that the king has arrived ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , I have seen him ; and this time you come from him - '' `` To inquire after you , monseigneur ; and , if your health is not too bad , to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle . '' 
`` Directly , Monsieur d'Artagnan , directly ! '' 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
said the captain , `` now the king is come , there is no more walking for anybody - no more free will ; the password governs all now , you as much as me , me as much as you . '' 
Fouquet heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage , so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by D'Artagnan , whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . 
: How the King , Louis XIV. , Played His Little Part . 
As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of Nantes , a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect , and gave him a letter . 
D'Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet , and pushed him away , but the message had been given to the surintendant . 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it , and instantly a vague terror , which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate , was painted on the countenance of the first minister . 
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm , and passed on towards the king 's apartments . 
D'Artagnan , through the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs , saw , as he went up behind Fouquet , the man who had delivered the note , looking round him on the place and making signs to several persons , who disappeared in the adjacent streets , after having themselves repeated the signals . 
Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken , - a terrace which abutted on the little corridor , at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located . 
Here D'Artagnan passed on before the surintendant , whom , till that time , he had respectfully accompanied , and entered the royal cabinet . 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Louis XIV. , who , on perceiving him , threw on to the table covered with papers a large green cloth . 
`` The order is executed , sire . '' 
`` And Fouquet ? '' 
`` Monsieur le surintendant follows me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` In ten minutes let him be introduced , '' said the king , dismissing D'Artagnan again with a gesture . 
The latter retired ; but had scarcely reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for him , when he was recalled by the king 's bell . 
`` Did he not appear astonished ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Who , sire ? '' 
`` Fouquet , '' replied the king , without saying monsieur , a peculiarity which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions . 
`` No , sire , '' replied he . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
And a second time Louis dismissed D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide . 
He reperused his note , conceived thus : `` Something is being contrived against you . 
Perhaps they will not dare to carry it out at the castle ; it will be on your return home . 
The house is already surrounded by musketeers . 
Do not enter . 
A white horse is in waiting for you behind the esplanade ! '' 
Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville . 
Not being willing that , if any evil happened to himself , this paper should compromise a faithful friend , the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand morsels , spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace . 
D'Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps in space . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` the king awaits you . '' 
Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor , where MM . 
de Brienne and Rose were at work , whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan , seated on a chair , likewise in the corridor , appeared to be waiting for orders , with feverish impatience , his sword between his legs . 
It appeared strange to Fouquet that MM .
