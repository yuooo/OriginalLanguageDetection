Raoul redeemed nothing but his weakness , and only confessed his grief . 
Thus passed away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had so violently shaken the indomitable pride of the king . 
Never , when conversing with his son , did he make any allusion to that scene ; never did he give him the details of that vigorous lecture , which might , perhaps , have consoled the young man , by showing him his rival humbled . 
Athos did not wish that the offended lover should forget the respect due to his king . 
And when Bragelonne , ardent , angry , and melancholy , spoke with contempt of royal words , of the equivocal faith which certain madmen draw from promises that emanate from thrones , when , passing over two centuries , with that rapidity of a bird that traverses a narrow strait to go from one continent to the other , Raoul ventured to predict the time in which kings would be esteemed as less than other men , Athos said to him , in his serene , persuasive voice , `` You are right , Raoul ; all that you say will happen ; kings will lose their privileges , as stars which have survived their aeons lose their splendor . 
But when that moment comes , Raoul , we shall be dead . 
And remember well what I say to you . 
In this world , all , men , women , and kings , must live for the present . 
We can only live for the future for God . '' 
This was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were , as usual , conversing , and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park , when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the hour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor , was rung ; and , without attaching any importance to it , he turned towards the house with his son ; and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence of Aramis and Porthos . 
: The Last Adieux . 
Raoul uttered a cry , and affectionately embraced Porthos . 
Aramis and Athos embraced like old men ; and this embrace itself being a question for Aramis , he immediately said , `` My friend , we have not long to remain with you . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the comte . 
`` Only time to tell you of my good fortune , '' interrupted Porthos . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Raoul . 
Athos looked silently at Aramis , whose somber air had already appeared to him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted . 
`` What is the good fortune that has happened to you ? 
Let us hear it , '' said Raoul , with a smile . 
`` The king has made me a duke , '' said the worthy Porthos , with an air of mystery , in the ear of the young man , `` a duke by brevet . '' 
But the asides of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by everybody . 
His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring . 
Athos heard him , and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start . 
The latter took Athos by the arm , and , after having asked Porthos 's permission to say a word to his friend in private , `` My dear Athos , '' he began , `` you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble . '' 
`` With grief and trouble , my dear friend ? '' 
cried the comte ; `` oh , what ? '' 
`` In two words . 
I have conspired against the king ; that conspiracy has failed , and , at this moment , I am doubtless pursued . '' 
`` You are pursued ! 
- a conspiracy ! 
Eh ! 
my friend , what do you tell me ? '' 
`` The saddest truth . 
I am entirely ruined . '' 
`` Well , but Porthos - this title of duke - what does all that mean ? '' 
`` That is the subject of my severest pain ; that is the deepest of my wounds . 
I have , believing in infallible success , drawn Porthos into my conspiracy . 
He threw himself into it , as you know he would do , with all his strength , without knowing what he was about ; and now he is as much compromised as myself - as completely ruined as I am . '' 
`` Good God ! '' 
And Athos turned towards Porthos , who was smiling complacently . 
`` I must make you acquainted with the whole . 
Listen to me , '' continued Aramis ; and he related the history as we know it . 
Athos , during the recital , several times felt the sweat break from his forehead . 
`` It was a great idea , '' said he , `` but a great error . '' 
`` For which I am punished , Athos . '' 
`` Therefore , I will not tell you my entire thought . '' 
`` Tell it , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is a crime . '' 
`` A capital crime ; I know it is . 
Lese majeste . '' 
`` Porthos ! 
poor Porthos ! '' 
`` What would you advise me to do ? 
Success , as I have told you , was certain . '' 
`` M. Fouquet is an honest man . '' 
`` And I a fool for having so ill-judged him , '' said Aramis . 
`` Oh , the wisdom of man ! 
Oh , millstone that grinds the world ! 
and which is one day stopped by a grain of sand which has fallen , no one knows how , between its wheels . '' 
`` Say by a diamond , Aramis . 
But the thing is done . 
How do you think of acting ? '' 
`` I am taking away Porthos . 
The king will never believe that that worthy man has acted innocently . 
He never can believe that Porthos has thought he was serving the king , whilst acting as he has done . 
His head would pay my fault . 
It shall not , must not , be so . '' 
`` You are taking him away , whither ? '' 
`` To Belle-Isle , at first . 
That is an impregnable place of refuge . 
Then , I have the sea , and a vessel to pass over into England , where I have many relations . '' 
`` You ? 
in England ? '' 
`` Yes , or else in Spain , where I have still more . '' 
`` But , our excellent Porthos ! 
you ruin him , for the king will confiscate all his property . '' 
`` All is provided for . 
I know how , when once in Spain , to reconcile myself with Louis XIV. , and restore Porthos to favor . '' 
`` You have credit , seemingly , Aramis ! '' 
said Athos , with a discreet air . 
`` Much ; and at the service of my friends . '' 
These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand . 
`` Thank you , '' replied the comte . 
`` And while we are on this head , '' said Aramis , `` you also are a malcontent ; you also , Raoul , have griefs to lay to the king . 
Follow our example ; pass over into Belle-Isle . 
Then we shall see , I guarantee upon my honor , that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the subject of this son of Louis XIII. , who is an Infante likewise , and whom France detains inhumanly . 
Now , as Louis XIV . 
would have no inclination for a war on that subject , I will answer for an arrangement , the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me , and a duchy in France to you , who are already a grandee of Spain . 
Will you join us ? '' 
`` No ; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with ; it is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal races . 
Doing what you propose , I should become the obliged of the king ; I should certainly be the gainer on that ground , but I should be a loser in my conscience . 
- No , thank you ! '' 
`` Then give me two things , Athos , - your absolution . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed against the oppressor . '' 
`` That is sufficient for me , '' said Aramis , with a blush which was lost in the obscurity of the night . 
`` And now , give me your two best horses to gain the second post , as I have been refused any under the pretext of the Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country . '' 
`` You shall have the two best horses , Aramis ; and again I recommend poor Porthos strongly to your care . ''
