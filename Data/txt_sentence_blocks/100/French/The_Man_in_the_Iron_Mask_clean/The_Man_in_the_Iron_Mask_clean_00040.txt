This sweat - bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe , as the gore of Abel frightened Cain . 
`` I am face to face with my destiny , '' said Philippe , his eyes on fire , and his face a livid white . 
`` Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy ? 
Though I am compelled to follow out , at every moment , the sovereign power and authority I have usurped , shall I cease to listen to the scruples of my heart ? 
Yes ! 
the king has lain on this bed ; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this pillow ; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief : and yet , I hesitate to throw myself on the bed , or to press in my hand the handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother 's arms . 
Away with such weakness ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , who asserts that a man 's action should be always one degree above his thoughts ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , whose thoughts are of and for himself alone , who regards himself as a man of honor , so long as he injures or betrays his enemies only . 
I , I alone , should have occupied this bed , if Louis XIV . 
had not , owing to my mother 's criminal abandonment , stood in my way ; and this handkerchief , embroidered with the arms of France , would in right and justice belong to me alone , if , as M. d'Herblay observes , I had been left my royal cradle . 
Philippe , son of France , take your place on that bed ; Philippe , sole king of France , resume the blazonry that is yours ! 
Philippe , sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII. , your father , show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who , at this moment , has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to . '' 
With these words , Philippe , notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling , and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will , threw himself on the royal bed , and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis XIV . 
had lain , while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother 's tears . 
With his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow , Philippe perceived above him the crown of France , suspended , as we have stated , by angels with outspread golden wings . 
A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion 's den , but can hardly hope to sleep there quietly . 
Philippe listened attentively to every sound ; his heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror and misfortune ; but confident in his own strength , which was confirmed by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination , he waited until some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself . 
He hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him , like those phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle . 
But nothing approached . 
Silence , that mortal enemy of restless hearts , and of ambitious minds , shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king of France , who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown . 
Towards the morning a shadow , rather than a body , glided into the royal chamber ; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any surprise . 
`` Well , M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` Well , sire , all is accomplished . '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Exactly as we expected . '' 
`` Did he resist ? '' 
`` Terribly ! 
tears and entreaties . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` A perfect stupor . '' 
`` But at last ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
at last , a complete victory , and absolute silence . '' 
`` Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` The resemblance , however - '' `` Was the cause of the success . '' 
`` But the prisoner can not fail to explain himself . 
Think well of that . 
I have myself been able to do as much as that , on former occasion . '' 
`` I have already provided for every chance . 
In a few days , sooner if necessary , we will take the captive out of his prison , and will send him out of the country , to a place of exile so remote - '' `` People can return from their exile , Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` To a place of exile so distant , I was going to say , that human strength and the duration of human life would not be enough for his return . '' 
Once more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the young king . 
`` And M. du Vallon ? '' 
asked Philippe in order to change the conversation . 
`` He will be presented to you to-day , and confidentially will congratulate you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run . '' 
`` What is to be done with him ? '' 
`` With M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` Yes ; confer a dukedom on him , I suppose . '' 
`` A dukedom , '' replied Aramis , smiling in a significant manner . 
`` Why do you laugh , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea . '' 
`` Cautious , why so ? '' 
`` Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become a troublesome witness , and you wish to get rid of him . '' 
`` What ! 
in making him a duke ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you would assuredly kill him , for he would die from joy , and the secret would die with him . '' 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , phlegmatically ; `` I should lose a very good friend . '' 
At this moment , and in the middle of this idle conversation , under the light tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride at their mutual success , Aramis heard something which made him prick up his ears . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Philippe . 
`` The dawn , sire . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , before you retired to bed last night , you probably decided to do something this morning at break of day . '' 
`` Yes , I told my captain of the musketeers , '' replied the young man hurriedly , `` that I should expect him . '' 
`` If you told him that , he will certainly be here , for he is a most punctual man . '' 
`` I hear a step in the vestibule . '' 
`` It must be he . '' 
`` Come , let us begin the attack , '' said the young king resolutely . 
`` Be cautious for Heaven 's sake . 
To begin the attack , and with D'Artagnan , would be madness . 
D'Artagnan knows nothing , he has seen nothing ; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree , but if he comes into this room the first this morning , he will be sure to detect something of what has taken place , and which he would imagine it his business to occupy himself about . 
Before we allow D'Artagnan to penetrate into this room , we must air the room thoroughly , or introduce so many people into it , that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different persons . '' 
`` But how can I send him away , since I have given him a rendezvous ? '' 
observed the prince , impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an antagonist . 
`` I will take care of that , '' replied the bishop , `` and in order to begin , I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man . '' 
`` He , too , is striking a blow , for I hear him at the door , '' added the prince , hurriedly . 
And , in fact , a knock at the door was heard at that moment . 
Aramis was not mistaken ; for it was indeed D'Artagnan who adopted that mode of announcing himself . 
We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet , but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep , and as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices of the superintendent 's room , D'Artagnan rose from his armchair , arranged his sword , brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve , like a private soldier getting ready for inspection . 
`` Are you going out ? '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . 
And you ? '' 
`` I shall remain . '' 
`` You pledge your word ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good . 
Besides , my only reason for going out is to try and get that reply , - you know what I mean ? '' 
`` That sentence , you mean - '' `` Stay , I have something of the old Roman in me . 
This morning , when I got up , I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the aiguillettes , and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off . 
That is an infallible sign . '' 
`` Of prosperity ? '' 
`` Yes , be sure of it ; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to my back , it always signified a punishment from M. de Treville , or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin . 
Every time my sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt , it always predicted some disagreeable commission or another for me to execute , and I have had showers of them all my life through . 
Every time , too , my sword danced about in its sheath , a duel , fortunate in its result , was sure to follow : whenever it dangled about the calves of my legs , it signified a slight wound ; every time it fell completely out of the scabbard , I was booked , and made up my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle , with two or three months under surgical bandages into the bargain . '' 
`` I did not know your sword kept you so well informed , '' said Fouquet , with a faint smile , which showed how he was struggling against his own weakness . 
`` Is your sword bewitched , or under the influence of some imperial charm ? '' 
`` Why , you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own body . 
I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them by feeling something the matter with their legs , or a throbbing of their temples .
