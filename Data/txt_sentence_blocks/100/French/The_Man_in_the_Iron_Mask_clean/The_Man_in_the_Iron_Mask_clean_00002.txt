`` You asked me the same question the first time you saw me , '' returned the prisoner . 
`` And then , as now you evaded giving me an answer . '' 
`` And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you ? '' 
`` Because this time I am your confessor . '' 
`` Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed , explain to me in what a crime consists . 
For as my conscience does not accuse me , I aver that I am not a criminal . '' 
`` We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth , not alone for having ourselves committed crimes , but because we know that crimes have been committed . '' 
The prisoner manifested the deepest attention . 
`` Yes , I understand you , '' he said , after a pause ; `` yes , you are right , monsieur ; it is very possible that , in such a light , I am a criminal in the eyes of the great of the earth . '' 
`` Ah ! 
then you know something , '' said Aramis , who thought he had pierced not merely through a defect in the harness , but through the joints of it . 
`` No , I am not aware of anything , '' replied the young man ; `` but sometimes I think - and I say to myself - '' `` What do you say to yourself ? '' 
`` That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad or I should divine a great deal . '' 
`` And then - and then ? '' 
said Aramis , impatiently . 
`` Then I leave off . '' 
`` You leave off ? '' 
`` Yes ; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy ; I feel ennui overtaking me ; I wish - '' `` What ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things which I do not possess , when I am so happy with what I have . '' 
`` You are afraid of death ? '' 
said Aramis , with a slight uneasiness . 
`` Yes , '' said the young man , smiling . 
Aramis felt the chill of that smile , and shuddered . 
`` Oh , as you fear death , you know more about matters than you say , '' he cried . 
`` And you , '' returned the prisoner , `` who bade me to ask to see you ; you , who , when I did ask to see you , came here promising a world of confidence ; how is it that , nevertheless , it is you who are silent , leaving it for me to speak ? 
Since , then , we both wear masks , either let us both retain them or put them aside together . '' 
Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark , saying to himself , `` This is no ordinary man ; I must be cautious . 
- Are you ambitious ? '' 
said he suddenly to the prisoner , aloud , without preparing him for the alteration . 
`` What do you mean by ambitious ? '' 
replied the youth . 
`` Ambition , '' replied Aramis , `` is the feeling which prompts a man to desire more - much more - than he possesses . '' 
`` I said that I was contented , monsieur ; but , perhaps , I deceive myself . 
I am ignorant of the nature of ambition ; but it is not impossible I may have some . 
Tell me your mind ; that is all I ask . '' 
`` An ambitious man , '' said Aramis , `` is one who covets that which is beyond his station . '' 
`` I covet nothing beyond my station , '' said the young man , with an assurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes tremble . 
He was silent . 
But to look at the kindling eye , the knitted brow , and the reflective attitude of the captive , it was evident that he expected something more than silence , - a silence which Aramis now broke . 
`` You lied the first time I saw you , '' said he . 
`` Lied ! '' 
cried the young man , starting up on his couch , with such a tone in his voice , and such a lightning in his eyes , that Aramis recoiled , in spite of himself . 
`` I should say , '' returned Aramis , bowing , `` you concealed from me what you knew of your infancy . '' 
`` A man 's secrets are his own , monsieur , '' retorted the prisoner , `` and not at the mercy of the first chance-comer . '' 
`` True , '' said Aramis , bowing still lower than before , '' 't is true ; pardon me , but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer ? 
I beseech you to reply , monseigneur . '' 
This title slightly disturbed the prisoner ; but nevertheless he did not appear astonished that it was given him . 
`` I do not know you , monsieur , '' said he . 
`` Oh , but if I dared , I would take your hand and kiss it ! '' 
The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand ; but the light which beamed in his eyes faded away , and he coldly and distrustfully withdrew his hand again . 
`` Kiss the hand of a prisoner , '' he said , shaking his head , `` to what purpose ? '' 
`` Why did you tell me , '' said Aramis , `` that you were happy here ? 
Why , that you aspired to nothing ? 
Why , in a word , by thus speaking , do you prevent me from being frank in my turn ? '' 
The same light shone a third time in the young man 's eyes , but died ineffectually away as before . 
`` You distrust me , '' said Aramis . 
`` And why say you so , monsieur ? '' 
`` Oh , for a very simple reason ; if you know what you ought to know , you ought to mistrust everybody . '' 
`` Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful , since you suspect me of knowing what I do not know . '' 
Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance . 
`` Oh , monseigneur ! 
you drive me to despair , '' said he , striking the armchair with his fist . 
`` And , on my part , I do not comprehend you , monsieur . '' 
`` Well , then , try to understand me . '' 
The prisoner looked fixedly at Aramis . 
`` Sometimes it seems to me , '' said the latter , `` that I have before me the man whom I seek , and then - '' `` And then your man disappears , - is it not so ? '' 
said the prisoner , smiling . 
`` So much the better . '' 
Aramis rose . 
`` Certainly , '' said he ; `` I have nothing further to say to a man who mistrusts me as you do . '' 
`` And I , monsieur , '' said the prisoner , in the same tone , `` have nothing to say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be mistrustful of everybody . '' 
`` Even of his old friends , '' said Aramis . 
`` Oh , monseigneur , you are too prudent ! '' 
`` Of my old friends ? 
- you one of my old friends , - you ? '' 
`` Do you no longer remember , '' said Aramis , `` that you once saw , in the village where your early years were spent - '' `` Do you know the name of the village ? '' 
asked the prisoner . 
`` Noisy-le-Sec , monseigneur , '' answered Aramis , firmly . 
`` Go on , '' said the young man , with an immovable aspect . 
`` Stay , monseigneur , '' said Aramis ; `` if you are positively resolved to carry on this game , let us break off . 
I am here to tell you many things , 't is true ; but you must allow me to see that , on your side , you have a desire to know them . 
Before revealing the important matters I still withhold , be assured I am in need of some encouragement , if not candor ; a little sympathy , if not confidence . 
But you keep yourself intrenched in a pretended which paralyzes me . 
Oh , not for the reason you think ; for , ignorant as you may be , or indifferent as you feign to be , you are none the less what you are , monseigneur , and there is nothing - nothing , mark me ! 
which can cause you not to be so . '' 
`` I promise you , '' replied the prisoner , `` to hear you without impatience . 
Only it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have already asked , ` Who are you ? ' '' 
`` Do you remember , fifteen or eighteen years ago , seeing at Noisy-le-Sec a cavalier , accompanied by a lady in black silk , with flame-colored ribbons in her hair ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the young man ; `` I once asked the name of this cavalier , and they told me that he called himself the Abbe d'Herblay . 
I was astonished that the abbe had so warlike an air , and they replied that there was nothing singular in that , seeing that he was one of Louis XIII . 
's musketeers . '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that musketeer and abbe , afterwards bishop of Vannes , is your confessor now . '' 
`` I know it ; I recognized you . '' 
`` Then , monseigneur , if you know that , I must further add a fact of which you are ignorant - that if the king were to know this evening of the presence of this musketeer , this abbe , this bishop , this confessor , here - he , who has risked everything to visit you , to-morrow would behold the steely glitter of the executioner 's axe in a dungeon more gloomy , more obscure than yours . '' 
While listening to these words , delivered with emphasis , the young man had raised himself on his couch , and was now gazing more and more eagerly at Aramis . 
The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some confidence from it . 
`` Yes , '' he murmured , `` I remember perfectly . 
The woman of whom you speak came once with you , and twice afterwards with another . '' 
He hesitated . 
`` With another , who came to see you every month - is it not so , monseigneur ? ''
