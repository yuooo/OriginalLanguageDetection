`` No , I do n't - by any means . '' 
`` Look here , my friend . 
In the first place , as you have said , to be measured is a loss of time , even though it occur only once a fortnight . 
And then , one may be travelling ; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you . 
In short , I have a horror of letting any one take my measure . 
Confound it ! 
either one is a nobleman or not . 
To be scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you , by inch and line - 't is degrading ! 
Here , they find you too hollow ; there , too prominent . 
They recognize your strong and weak points . 
See , now , when we leave the measurer 's hands , we are like those strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy . '' 
`` In truth , my dear Porthos , you possess ideas entirely original . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you see when a man is an engineer - '' `` And has fortified Belle-Isle - 't is natural , my friend . '' 
`` Well , I had an idea , which would doubtless have proved a good one , but for Mouston 's carelessness . '' 
D'Artagnan glanced at Mouston , who replied by a slight movement of his body , as if to say , `` You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this . '' 
`` I congratulated myself , then , '' resumed Porthos , `` at seeing Mouston get fat ; and I did all I could , by means of substantial feeding , to make him stout - always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth , and could then be measured in my stead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I see - that spared you both time and humiliation . '' 
`` Consider my joy when , after a year and a half 's judicious feeding - for I used to feed him up myself - the fellow - '' `` Oh ! 
I lent a good hand myself , monsieur , '' said Mouston , humbly . 
`` That 's true . 
Consider my joy when , one morning , I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in , as I once did myself , to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon , in the chateau of Pierrefonds . 
And , by the way , about that door , my friend , I should like to ask you , who know everything , why these wretches of architects , who ought to have the compasses run into them , just to remind them , came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass ? '' 
`` Oh , those doors , '' answered D'Artagnan , `` were meant for gallants , and they have generally slight and slender figures . '' 
`` Madame du Vallon had no gallant ! '' 
answered Porthos , majestically . 
`` Perfectly true , my friend , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` but the architects were probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of your marrying again . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is possible , '' said Porthos . 
`` And now I have received an explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow , let us return to the subject of Mouston 's fatness . 
But see how the two things apply to each other . 
I have always noticed that people 's ideas run parallel . 
And so , observe this phenomenon , D'Artagnan . 
I was talking to you of Mouston , who is fat , and it led us on to Madame du Vallon - '' `` Who was thin ? '' 
`` Hum ! 
Is it not marvelous ? '' 
`` My dear friend , a savant of my acquaintance , M. Costar , has made the same observation as you have , and he calls the process by some Greek name which I forget . '' 
`` What ! 
my remark is not then original ? '' 
cried Porthos , astounded . 
`` I thought I was the discoverer . '' 
`` My friend , the fact was known before Aristotle 's days - that is to say , nearly two thousand years ago . '' 
`` Well , well , 't is no less true , '' said Porthos , delighted at the idea of having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest sages of antiquity . 
`` Wonderfully - but suppose we return to Mouston . 
It seems to me , we have left him fattening under our very eyes . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` Well , '' said Porthos , `` Mouston fattened so well , that he gratified all my hopes , by reaching my standard ; a fact of which I was well able to convince myself , by seeing the rascal , one day , in a waistcoat of mine , which he had turned into a coat - a waistcoat , the mere embroidery of which was worth a hundred pistoles . '' '' 
'T was only to try it on , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors , and to have him measured instead of myself . '' 
`` A capital idea , Porthos ; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you . '' 
`` Exactly ! 
They measured him down to the ground , and the end of the skirt came just below my knee . '' 
`` What a marvelous man you are , Porthos ! 
Such a thing could happen only to you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; pay your compliments ; you have ample grounds to go upon . 
It was exactly at that time - that is to say , nearly two years and a half ago - that I set out for Belle-Isle , instructing Mouston -LRB- so as always to have , in every event , a pattern of every fashion -RRB- to have a coat made for himself every month . '' 
`` And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions ? 
Ah ! 
that was anything but right , Mouston . '' 
`` No , monsieur , quite the contrary ; quite the contrary ! '' 
`` No , he never forgot to have his coats made ; but he forgot to inform me that he had got stouter ! '' 
`` But it was not my fault , monsieur ! 
your tailor never told me . '' 
`` And this to such an extent , monsieur , '' continued Porthos , `` that the fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth , and so my last dozen coats are all too large , from a foot to a foot and a half . '' 
`` But the rest ; those which were made when you were of the same size ? '' 
`` They are no longer the fashion , my dear friend . 
Were I to put them on , I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam ; and as though I had been two years away from court . '' 
`` I understand your difficulty . 
You have how many new suits ? 
nine ? 
thirty - six ? 
and yet not one to wear . 
Well , you must have a thirty-seventh made , and give the thirty-six to Mouston . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
said Mouston , with a gratified air . 
`` The truth is , that monsieur has always been very generous to me . '' 
`` Do you mean to insinuate that I had n't that idea , or that I was deterred by the expense ? 
But it wants only two days to the fete ; I received the invitation yesterday ; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe , and only this morning discovered my misfortune ; and from now till the day after to - morrow , there is n't a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit . '' 
`` That is to say , one covered all over with gold , is n't it ? '' 
`` I wish it so ! 
undoubtedly , all over . '' 
`` Oh , we shall manage it . 
You wo n't leave for three days . 
The invitations are for Wednesday , and this is only Sunday morning . '' '' 
'T is true ; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours beforehand . '' 
`` How , Aramis ? '' 
`` Yes , it was Aramis who brought me the invitation . '' 
`` Ah ! 
to be sure , I see . 
You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` By no means ! 
by the king , dear friend . 
The letter bears the following as large as life : 'M . 
le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list - ' '' `` Very good ; but you leave with M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` And when I think , '' cried Porthos , stamping on the floor , `` when I think I shall have no clothes , I am ready to burst with rage ! 
I should like to strangle somebody or smash something ! ''
