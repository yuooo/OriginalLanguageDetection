Their masters must not enter . '' 
`` That is clear , '' said Porthos . 
`` You understand , '' added Aramis , with the rapid precision of command ; `` there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under which the fox has glided - but at the too narrow opening of which they must be themselves stopped and killed . '' 
The Bretons sprang forward , knife in hand . 
In a few minutes there was a lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls - and then , silence . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
said Aramis , coolly , `` now for the masters ! '' 
`` What is to be done with them ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Wait their arrival , conceal ourselves , and kill them . '' 
`` Kill them ! '' 
replied Porthos . 
`` There are sixteen , '' said Aramis , `` at least , at present . '' 
`` And well armed , '' added Porthos , with a smile of consolation . 
`` It will last about ten minutes , '' said Aramis . 
`` To work ! '' 
And with a resolute air he took up a musket , and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth . 
`` Yves , Goenne , and his son , '' continued Aramis , will pass the muskets to us . 
You , Porthos , will fire when they are close . 
We shall have brought down , at the lowest computation , eight , before the others are aware of anything - that is certain ; then all , there are five of us , will dispatch the other eight , knife in hand . '' 
`` And poor Biscarrat ? '' 
said Porthos . 
Aramis reflected a moment - `` Biscarrat first , '' replied he , coolly . 
`` He knows us . '' 
: The Grotto . 
In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the character of Aramis , the event , subject to the risks of things over which uncertainty presides , did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had foreseen . 
Biscarrat , better mounted than his companions , arrived first at the opening of the grotto , and comprehended that fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it . 
Only , struck by that superstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man , he stopped at the outside of the grotto , and waited till his companions should have assembled round him . 
`` Well ! '' 
asked the young men , coming up , out of breath , and unable to understand the meaning of this inaction . 
`` Well ! 
I can not hear the dogs ; they and the fox must all be lost in this infernal cavern . '' 
`` They were too close up , '' said one of the guards , `` to have lost scent all at once . 
Besides , we should hear them from one side or another . 
They must , as Biscarrat says , be in this grotto . '' 
`` But then , '' said one of the young men , `` why do n't they give tongue ? '' 
`` It is strange ! '' 
muttered another . 
`` Well , but , '' said a fourth , `` let us go into this grotto . 
Does it happen to be forbidden we should enter it ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat . 
`` Only , as it looks as dark as a wolf 's mouth , we might break our necks in it . '' 
`` Witness the dogs , '' said a guard , `` who seem to have broken theirs . '' 
`` What the devil can have become of them ? '' 
asked the young men in chorus . 
And every master called his dog by his name , whistled to him in his favorite mode , without a single one replying to either call or whistle . 
`` It is perhaps an enchanted grotto , '' said Biscarrat ; `` let us see . '' 
And , jumping from his horse , he made a step into the grotto . 
`` Stop ! 
stop ! 
I will accompany you , '' said one of the guards , on seeing Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern 's mouth . 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat , `` there must be something extraordinary in the place - do n't let us risk ourselves all at once . 
If in ten minutes you do not hear of me , you can come in , but not all at once . '' 
`` Be it so , '' said the young man , who , besides , did not imagine that Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise , `` we will wait for you . '' 
And without dismounting from their horses , they formed a circle round the grotto . 
Biscarrat entered then alone , and advanced through the darkness till he came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos 's musket . 
The resistance which his chest met with astonished him ; he naturally raised his hand and laid hold of the icy barrel . 
At the same instant , Yves lifted a knife against the young man , which was about to fall upon him with all force of a Breton 's arm , when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way . 
Then , like low muttering thunder , his voice growled in the darkness , `` I will not have him killed ! '' 
Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat , the one almost as terrible as the other . 
However brave the young man might be , he could not prevent a cry escaping him , which Aramis immediately suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth . 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said he , in a low voice , `` we mean you no harm , and you must know that if you have recognized us ; but , at the first word , the first groan , the first whisper , we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs . '' 
`` Yes , I recognize you , gentlemen , '' said the officer , in a low voice . 
`` But why are you here - what are you doing , here ? 
Unfortunate men ! 
I thought you were in the fort . '' 
`` And you , monsieur , you were to obtain conditions for us , I think ? '' 
`` I did all I was able , messieurs , but - '' `` But what ? '' 
`` But there are positive orders . '' 
`` To kill us ? '' 
Biscarrat made no reply . 
It would have cost him too much to speak of the cord to gentlemen . 
Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner . 
`` Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said he , `` you would be already dead if we had not regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father ; but you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your companions what you have seen . '' 
`` I will not only swear that I will not speak of it , '' said Biscarrat , `` but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto . '' 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried several voices from the outside , coming like a whirlwind into the cave . 
`` Reply , '' said Aramis . 
`` Here I am ! '' 
cried Biscarrat . 
`` Now , begone ; we depend on your loyalty . '' 
And he left his hold of the young man , who hastily returned towards the light . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the voices , still nearer . 
And the shadows of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto . 
Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them , and met them just as they were adventuring into the cave . 
Aramis and Porthos listened with the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
exclaimed one of the guards , as he came to the light , `` how pale you are ! '' 
`` Pale ! '' 
cried another ; `` you ought to say corpse-color . '' 
`` I ! '' 
said the young man , endeavoring to collect his faculties . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
what has happened ? '' 
exclaimed all the voices . 
`` You have not a drop of blood in your veins , my poor friend , '' said one of them , laughing .
