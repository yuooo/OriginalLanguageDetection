Louis held up the massive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use . 
`` Sire , '' said Fouquet , in a voice trembling with emotion , `` do you not recognize the most faithful of your friends ? '' 
`` A friend - you ! '' 
repeated Louis , gnashing his teeth in a manner which betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance . 
`` The most respectful of your servants , '' added Fouquet , throwing himself on his knees . 
The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp . 
Fouquet approached him , kissed his knees , and took him in his arms with inconceivable tenderness . 
`` My king , my child , '' he said , `` how you must have suffered ! '' 
Louis , recalled to himself by the change of situation , looked at himself , and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel , ashamed of his conduct , and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was shown towards him , drew back . 
Fouquet did not understand this movement ; he did not perceive that the king 's feeling of pride would never forgive him for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness . 
`` Come , sire , '' he said , `` you are free . '' 
`` Free ? '' 
repeated the king . 
`` Oh ! 
you set me at liberty , then , after having dared to lift up your hand against me . '' 
`` You do not believe that ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet , indignantly ; `` you can not believe me to be guilty of such an act . '' 
And rapidly , warmly even , he related the whole particulars of the intrigue , the details of which are already known to the reader . 
While the recital continued , Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind ; and when it was finished , the magnitude of the danger he had run struck him far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin brother . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , suddenly to Fouquet , `` this double birth is a falsehood ; it is impossible - you can not have been the dupe of it . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
`` It is impossible , I tell you , that the honor , the virtue of my mother can be suspected , and my first minister has not yet done justice on the criminals ! '' 
`` Reflect , sire , before you are hurried away by anger , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` The birth of your brother - '' `` I have only one brother - and that is Monsieur . 
You know it as well as myself . 
There is a plot , I tell you , beginning with the governor of the Bastile . '' 
`` Be careful , sire , for this man has been deceived as every one else has by the prince 's likeness to yourself . '' 
`` Likeness ? 
Absurd ! '' 
`` This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty , to be able to deceive every one 's eye , '' Fouquet persisted . 
`` Ridiculous ! '' 
`` Do not say so , sire ; those who had prepared everything in order to face and deceive your ministers , your mother , your officers of state , the members of your family , must be quite confident of the resemblance between you . '' 
`` But where are these persons , then ? '' 
murmured the king . 
`` At Vaux . '' 
`` At Vaux ! 
and you suffer them to remain there ! '' 
`` My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty 's release . 
I have accomplished that duty ; and now , whatever your majesty may command , shall be done . 
I await your orders . '' 
Louis reflected for a few moments . 
`` Muster all the troops in Paris , '' he said . 
`` All the necessary orders are given for that purpose , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` You have given orders ! '' 
exclaimed the king . 
`` For that purpose , yes , sire ; your majesty will be at the head of ten thousand men in less than an hour . '' 
The only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet 's hand with such an expression of feeling , that it was very easy to perceive how strongly he had , until that remark , maintained his suspicions of the minister , notwithstanding the latter 's intervention . 
`` And with these troops , '' he said , `` we shall go at once and besiege in your house the rebels who by this time will have established and intrenched themselves therein . '' 
`` I should be surprised if that were the case , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because their chief - the very soul of the enterprise - having been unmasked by me , the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried . '' 
`` You have unmasked this false prince also ? '' 
`` No , I have not seen him . '' 
`` Whom have you seen , then ? '' 
`` The leader of the enterprise , not that unhappy young man ; the latter is merely an instrument , destined through his whole life to wretchedness , I plainly perceive . '' 
`` Most certainly . '' 
`` It is M. l'Abbe d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes . '' 
`` Your friend ? '' 
`` He was my friend , sire , '' replied Fouquet , nobly . 
`` An unfortunate circumstance for you , '' said the king , in a less generous tone of voice . 
`` Such friendships , sire , had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I was ignorant of the crime . '' 
`` You should have foreseen it . '' 
`` If I am guilty , I place myself in your majesty 's hands . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Monsieur Fouquet , it was not that I meant , '' returned the king , sorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner . 
`` Well ! 
I assure you that , notwithstanding the mask with which the villain covered his face , I had something like a vague suspicion that he was the very man . 
But with this chief of the enterprise there was a man of prodigious strength , the one who menaced me with a force almost herculean ; what is he ? '' 
`` It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon , formerly one of the musketeers . '' 
`` The friend of D'Artagnan ? 
the friend of the Comte de la Fere ? 
Ah ! '' 
exclaimed the king , as he paused at the name of the latter , `` we must not forget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de Bragelonne . '' 
`` Sire , sire , do not go too far . 
M. de la Fere is the most honorable man in France . 
Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you . '' 
`` With those whom you deliver up to me , you say ? 
Very good , for you will deliver up those who are guilty to me . '' 
`` What does your majesty understand by that ? '' 
inquired Fouquet . 
`` I understand , '' replied the king , `` that we shall soon arrive at Vaux with a large body of troops , that we will lay violent hands upon that nest of vipers , and that not a soul shall escape . '' 
`` Your majesty will put these men to death ! '' 
cried Fouquet . 
`` To the very meanest of them . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sire . '' 
`` Let us understand one another , Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , haughtily . 
`` We no longer live in times when assassination was the only and the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity . 
No , Heaven be praised ! 
I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name , and I have scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out . '' 
Fouquet turned pale . 
`` I will take the liberty of observing to your majesty , that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne . 
The august name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of the people accompanied by a smile . '' 
`` Justice must be done , however , monsieur . '' 
`` Good , sire ; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold . '' 
`` The royal blood ! 
you believe that ! '' 
cried the king with fury in his voice , stamping his foot on the ground . 
`` This double birth is an invention ; and in that invention , particularly , do I see M. d'Herblay 's crime . 
It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence , or the insult . ''
