Philippe gave orders that for his petit lever the grandes entrees , already prepared to appear before the king , should be introduced . 
He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence of M. d'Herblay , who did not return - our readers know the reason . 
But the prince , not believing that absence could be prolonged , wished , as all rash spirits do , to try his valor and his fortune far from all protection and instruction . 
Another reason urged him to this - Anne of Austria was about to appear ; the guilty mother was about to stand in the presence of her sacrificed son . 
Philippe was not willing , if he had a weakness , to render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound thenceforth to display so much strength . 
Philippe opened his folding doors , and several persons entered silently . 
Philippe did not stir whilst his valets de chambre dressed him . 
He had watched , the evening before , all the habits of his brother , and played the king in such a manner as to awaken no suspicion . 
He was thus completely dressed in hunting costume when he received his visitors . 
His own memory and the notes of Aramis announced everybody to him , first of all Anne of Austria , to whom Monsieur gave his hand , and then Madame with M. de Saint-Aignan . 
He smiled at seeing these countenances , but trembled on recognizing his mother . 
That still so noble and imposing figure , ravaged by pain , pleaded in his heart the cause of the famous queen who had immolated a child to reasons of state . 
He found his mother still handsome . 
He knew that Louis XIV . 
loved her , and he promised himself to love her likewise , and not to prove a scourge to her old age . 
He contemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be understood . 
The latter had usurped nothing , had cast no shades athwart his life . 
A separate tree , he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its elevation or majestic life . 
Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother to this prince , who required nothing but gold to minister to his pleasures . 
He bowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan , who was all reverences and smiles , and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta , his sister-in-law , whose beauty struck him ; but he saw in the eyes of that princess an expression of coldness which would facilitate , as he thought , their future relations . 
`` How much more easy , '' thought he , `` it will be to be the brother of that woman than her gallant , if she evinces towards me a coldness that my brother could not have for her , but which is imposed upon me as a duty . '' 
The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen ; his heart - his mind - had just been shaken by so violent a trial , that , in spite of their firm temperament , they would not , perhaps , support another shock . 
Happily the queen did not come . 
Then commenced , on the part of Anne of Austria , a political dissertation upon the welcome M. Fouquet had given to the house of France . 
She mixed up hostilities with compliments addressed to the king , and questions as to his health , with little maternal flatteries and diplomatic artifices . 
`` Well , my son , '' said she , `` are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' said Philippe , `` have the goodness to go and inquire after the queen . '' 
At these words , the first Philippe had pronounced aloud , the slight difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was sensible to maternal ears , and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her son . 
Saint-Aignan left the room , and Philippe continued : `` Madame , I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of , you know I do not - and you have even spoken well of him yourself . '' 
`` That is true ; therefore I only question you on the state of your sentiments with respect to him . '' 
`` Sire , '' said Henrietta , `` I , on my part , have always liked M. Fouquet . 
He is a man of good taste , - a superior man . '' 
`` A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly , '' added Monsieur ; `` and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him . '' 
`` Every one in this thinks too much of himself , and nobody for the state , '' said the old queen . 
`` M. Fouquet , it is a fact , M. Fouquet is ruining the state . '' 
`` Well , mother ! '' 
replied Philippe , in rather a lower key , `` do you likewise constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert ? '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
replied the old queen , rather surprised . 
`` Why , in truth , '' replied Philippe , `` you speak that just as your old friend Madame de Chevreuse would speak . '' 
`` Why do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me ? '' 
said she , `` and what sort of humor are you in to-day towards me ? '' 
Philippe continued : `` Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against somebody ? 
Has not Madame de Chevreuse been to pay you a visit , mother ? '' 
`` Monsieur , you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy I am listening to your father . '' 
`` My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse , and had good reason for not liking her , '' said the prince . 
`` For my part , I like her no better than he did , and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did , to sow divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money - why - '' `` Well ! 
what ? '' 
said Anne of Austria , proudly , herself provoking the storm . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied the young man firmly , `` I will drive Madame de Chevreuse out of my kingdom - and with her all who meddle with its secrets and mysteries . '' 
He had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech , or perhaps he wished to judge the effect of it , like those who , suffering from a chronic pain , and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering , touch their wound to procure a sharper pang . 
Anne of Austria was nearly fainting ; her eyes , open but meaningless , ceased to see for several seconds ; she stretched out her arms towards her other son , who supported and embraced her without fear of irritating the king . 
`` Sire , '' murmured she , `` you are treating your mother very cruelly . '' 
`` In what respect , madame ? '' 
replied he . 
`` I am only speaking of Madame de Chevreuse ; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security of the state and of my person ? 
Well , then , madame , I tell you Madame de Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money , and that she addressed herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret . '' 
`` A certain secret ! '' 
cried Anne of Austria . 
`` Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had committed , which is false , '' added Philippe . 
`` M. Fouquet rejected her offers with indignation , preferring the esteem of the king to complicity with such intriguers . 
Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M. Colbert , and as she is insatiable , and was not satisfied with having extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state , she has taken a still bolder flight , in search of surer sources of supply . 
Is that true , madame ? '' 
`` You know all , sire , '' said the queen , more uneasy than irritated . 
`` Now , '' continued Philippe , `` I have good reason to dislike this fury , who comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others . 
If Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed , and has concealed them in the shadow of its clemency , I will not permit Madame de Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate . '' 
The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother , that her son had pity on her . 
He took her hand and kissed it tenderly ; she did not feel that in that kiss , given in spite of repulsion and bitterness of the heart , there was a pardon for eight years of suffering . 
Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed themselves . 
Then , with a cheerful smile : `` We will not go to-day , '' said he , `` I have a plan . '' 
And , turning towards the door , he hoped to see Aramis , whose absence began to alarm him . 
The queen-mother wished to leave the room . 
`` Remain where you are , mother , '' said he , `` I wish you to make your peace with M. Fouquet . '' 
`` I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will ; I only dreaded his prodigalities . '' 
`` We will put that to rights , and will take nothing of the superintendent but his good qualities . '' 
`` What is your majesty looking for ? '' 
said Henrietta , seeing the king 's eyes constantly turned towards the door , and wishing to let fly a little poisoned arrow at his heart , supposing he was so anxiously expecting either La Valliere or a letter from her . 
`` My sister , '' said the young man , who had divined her thought , thanks to that marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to allow him the exercise , `` my sister , I am expecting a most distinguished man , a most able counselor , whom I wish to present to you all , recommending him to your good graces . 
Ah ! 
come in , then , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` What does your majesty wish ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , appearing . 
`` Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes , your friend ? '' 
`` Why , sire - '' `` I am waiting for him , and he does not come . 
Let him be sought for . '' 
D'Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied ; but soon , reflecting that Aramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king , he concluded that the king wished to preserve the secret . 
`` Sire , '' replied he , `` does your majesty absolutely require M. d'Herblay to be brought to you ? '' 
`` Absolutely is not the word , '' said Philippe ; `` I do not want him so particularly as that ; but if he can be found - '' `` I thought so , '' said D'Artagnan to himself . 
`` Is this M. d'Herblay the bishop of Vannes ? '' 
`` Yes , madame . '' 
`` A friend of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , madame ; an old musketeer . '' 
Anne of Austria blushed . 
`` One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies . '' 
The old queen repented of having wished to bite ; she broke off the conversation , in order to preserve the rest of her teeth . 
`` Whatever may be your choice , sire , '' said she , `` I have no doubt it will be excellent . '' 
All bowed in support of that sentiment . 
`` You will find in him , '' continued Philippe , `` the depth and penetration of M. de Richelieu , without the avarice of M. de Mazarin ! '' 
`` A prime minister , sire ? ''
