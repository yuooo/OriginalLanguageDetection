Then these men were seen to be in motion , and as in the good old times of Louis XIII . 
and M. de Treville , groups were formed , and staircases were filled ; vague murmurs , issuing from the court below , came rolling to the upper stories , like the distant moaning of the waves . 
M. de Gesvres became uneasy . 
He looked at his guards , who , after being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks , began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence . 
D'Artagnan was certainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres , the captain of the guards . 
As soon as he entered , he seated himself on the ledge of a window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without the least emotion . 
No step of the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him . 
He foresaw the very moment the explosion would take place ; and we know that his previsions were in general correct . 
`` It would be very whimsical , '' thought he , `` if , this evening , my praetorians should make me king of France . 
How I should laugh ! '' 
But , at the height , all was stopped . 
Guards , musketeers , officers , soldiers , murmurs , uneasiness , dispersed , vanished , died away ; there was an end of menace and sedition . 
One word had calmed the waves . 
The king had desired Brienne to say , `` Hush , messieurs ! 
you disturb the king . '' 
D'Artagnan sighed . 
`` All is over ! '' 
said he ; `` the musketeers of the present day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII . 
All is over ! '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king , '' proclaimed an usher . 
: King Louis XIV . 
The king was seated in his cabinet , with his back turned towards the door of entrance . 
In front of him was a mirror , in which , while turning over his papers , he could see at a glance those who came in . 
He did not take any notice of the entrance of D'Artagnan , but spread above his letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate . 
D'Artagnan understood this by-play , and kept in the background ; so that at the end of a minute the king , who heard nothing , and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye , was obliged to cry , `` Is not M. d'Artagnan there ? '' 
`` I am here , sire , '' replied the musketeer , advancing . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said the king , fixing his pellucid eyes on D'Artagnan , `` what have you to say to me ? '' 
`` I , sire ! '' 
replied the latter , who watched the first blow of his adversary to make a good retort ; `` I have nothing to say to your majesty , unless it be that you have caused me to be arrested , and here I am . '' 
The king was going to reply that he had not had D'Artagnan arrested , but any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse , and he was silent . 
D'Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence . 
`` Monsieur , '' at length resumed the king , `` what did I charge you to go and do at Belle-Isle ? 
Tell me , if you please . '' 
The king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain . 
Here D'Artagnan was fortunate ; the king seemed to place the game in his hands . 
`` I believe , '' replied he , `` that your majesty does me the honor to ask what I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Well ! 
sire , I know nothing about it ; it is not of me that question should be asked , but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds , to whom have been given innumerable orders of all kinds , whilst to me , head of the expedition , nothing precise was said or stated in any form whatever . '' 
The king was hurt : he showed it by his reply . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful . '' 
`` And , therefore , I have been astonished , sire , '' retorted the musketeer , `` that a captain like myself , who ranks with a marechal of France , should have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors , good to make spies of , possibly , but not at all fit to conduct a warlike expedition . 
It was upon this subject I came to demand an explanation of your majesty , when I found the door closed against me , which , the final insult offered to a brave man , has led me to quit your majesty 's service . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the king , `` you still believe that you are living in an age when kings were , as you complain of having been , under the orders and at the discretion of their inferiors . 
You seem to forget that a king owes an account of his actions to none but God . '' 
`` I forget nothing , sire , '' said the musketeer , wounded by this lesson . 
`` Besides , I do not see in what an honest man , when he asks of his king how he has ill-served him , offends him . '' 
`` You have ill-served me , monsieur , by siding with my enemies against me . '' 
`` Who are your enemies , sire ? '' 
`` The men I sent you to fight . '' 
`` Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty 's army ! 
That is incredible . '' 
`` You have no power to judge of my will . '' 
`` But I have to judge of my own friendships , sire . '' 
`` He who serves his friends does not serve his master . '' 
`` I so well understand this , sire , that I have respectfully offered your majesty my resignation . '' 
`` And I have accepted it , monsieur , '' said the king . 
`` Before being separated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep my word . '' 
`` Your majesty has kept more than your word , for your majesty has had me arrested , '' said D'Artagnan , with his cold , bantering air ; `` you did not promise me that , sire . '' 
The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry , and continued , seriously , `` You see , monsieur , to what grave steps your disobedience forces me . '' 
`` My disobedience ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , red with anger . 
`` It is the mildest term that I can find , '' pursued the king . 
`` My idea was to take and punish rebels ; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels were your friends or not ? '' 
`` But I was , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` It was a cruelty on your majesty 's part to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets . '' 
`` It was a trial I had to make , monsieur , of pretended servants , who eat my bread and should defend my person . 
The trial has succeeded ill , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` For one bad servant your majesty loses , '' said the musketeer , with bitterness , `` there are ten who , on that same day , go through a like ordeal . 
Listen to me , sire ; I am not accustomed to that service . 
Mine is a rebel sword when I am required to do ill . 
It was ill to send me in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet , your majesty 's preserver , implored you to save . 
Still further , these men were my friends . 
They did not attack your majesty , they succumbed to your blind anger . 
Besides , why were they not allowed to escape ? 
What crime had they committed ? 
I admit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct . 
But why suspect me before the action ? 
Why surround me with spies ? 
Why disgrace me before the army ? 
Why me , in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who for thirty years have been attached to your person , and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion - for it must be said , now that I am accused - why reduce me to see three thousand of the king 's soldiers march in battle against two men ? '' 
`` One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me ! '' 
said the king , in a hollow voice , `` and that it was no merit of theirs I was not lost . '' 
`` Sire , one would imagine you forget that I was there . '' 
`` Enough , Monsieur d'Artagnan , enough of these dominating interests which arise to keep the sun itself from my interests . 
I am founding a state in which there shall be but one master , as I promised you ; the moment is at hand for me to keep my promise . 
You wish to be , according to your tastes or private friendships , free to destroy my plans and save my enemies ? 
I will thwart you or will drop you - seek a more compliant master . 
I know full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do , and would allow himself to be dominated by you , at the risk of sending you some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest ; but I have an excellent memory , and for me , services are sacred titles to gratitude , to impunity . 
You shall only have this lesson , Monsieur d'Artagnan , as the punishment of your want of discipline , and I will not imitate my predecessors in anger , not having imitated them in favor . 
And , then , other reasons make me act mildly towards you ; in the first place , because you are a man of sense , a man of excellent sense , a man of heart , and that you will be a capital servant to him who shall have mastered you ; secondly , because you will cease to have any motives for insubordination . 
Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me . 
These supports on which your capricious mind instinctively relied I have caused to disappear . 
At this moment , my soldiers have taken or killed the rebels of Belle-Isle . '' 
D'Artagnan became pale . 
`` Taken or killed ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh ! 
sire , if you thought what you tell , if you were sure you were telling me the truth , I should forget all that is just , all that is magnanimous in your words , to call you a barbarous king , and an unnatural man . 
But I pardon you these words , '' said he , smiling with pride ; `` I pardon them to a young prince who does not know , who can not comprehend what such men as M. d'Herblay , M. du Vallon , and myself are .
