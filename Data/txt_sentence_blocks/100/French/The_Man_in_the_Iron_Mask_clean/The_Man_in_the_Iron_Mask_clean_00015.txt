`` I say I shall never be aught but an ass , '' answered La Fontaine , with a heavy sigh and swimming eyes . 
`` Yes , my friend , '' he added , with increasing grief , `` it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , 't is wrong to say so . '' 
`` Nay , I am a poor creature ! '' 
`` Who said so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
't was Pelisson ; did you not , Pelisson ? '' 
Pelisson , again absorbed in his work , took good care not to answer . 
`` But if Pelisson said you were so , '' cried Moliere , `` Pelisson has seriously offended you . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I advise you , as you are a gentleman , not to leave an insult like that unpunished . '' 
`` What ! '' 
exclaimed La Fontaine . 
`` Did you ever fight ? '' 
`` Once only , with a lieutenant in the light horse . '' 
`` What wrong had he done you ? '' 
`` It seems he ran away with my wife . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Moliere , becoming slightly pale ; but as , at La Fontaine 's declaration , the others had turned round , Moliere kept upon his lips the rallying smile which had so nearly died away , and continuing to make La Fontaine speak - `` And what was the result of the duel ? '' 
`` The result was , that on the ground my opponent disarmed me , and then made an apology , promising never again to set foot in my house . '' 
`` And you considered yourself satisfied ? '' 
said Moliere . 
`` Not at all ! 
on the contrary , I picked up my sword . ' 
I beg your pardon , monsieur , ' I said , ' I have not fought you because you were my wife 's friend , but because I was told I ought to fight . 
So , as I have never known any peace save since you made her acquaintance , do me the pleasure to continue your visits as heretofore , or morbleu ! 
let us set to again . ' 
And so , '' continued La Fontaine , `` he was compelled to resume his friendship with madame , and I continue to be the happiest of husbands . '' 
All burst out laughing . 
Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes . 
Why ? 
Perhaps to wipe away a tear , perhaps to smother a sigh . 
Alas ! 
we know that Moliere was a moralist , but he was not a philosopher . '' 
'T is all one , '' he said , returning to the topic of the conversation , `` Pelisson has insulted you . '' 
`` Ah , truly ! 
I had already forgotten it . '' 
`` And I am going to challenge him on your behalf . '' 
`` Well , you can do so , if you think it indispensable . '' 
`` I do think it indispensable , and I am going to - '' `` Stay , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` I want your advice . '' 
`` Upon what ? 
this insult ? '' 
`` No ; tell me really now whether lumiere does not rhyme with orniere . '' 
`` I should make them rhyme . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I knew you would . '' 
`` And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time . '' 
`` A hundred thousand ! '' 
cried La Fontaine . 
`` Four times as many as ` La Pucelle , ' which M. Chaplain is meditating . 
Is it also on this subject , too , that you have composed a hundred thousand verses ? '' 
`` Listen to me , you eternally absent-minded creature , '' said Moliere . 
`` It is certain , '' continued La Fontaine , `` that legume , for instance , rhymes with posthume . '' 
`` In the plural , above all . '' 
`` Yes , above all in the plural , seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters , but with four ; as orniere does with lumiere . '' 
`` But give me ornieres and lumieres in the plural , my dear Pelisson , '' said La Fontaine , clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend , whose insult he had quite forgotten , `` and they will rhyme . '' 
`` Hem ! '' 
coughed Pelisson . 
`` Moliere says so , and Moliere is a judge of such things ; he declares he has himself made a hundred thousand verses . '' 
`` Come , '' said Moliere , laughing , `` he is off now . '' 
`` It is like rivage , which rhymes admirably with herbage . 
I would take my oath of it . '' 
`` But - '' said Moliere . 
`` I tell you all this , '' continued La Fontaine , `` because you are preparing a divertissement for Vaux , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , the ` Facheux . ' '' 
`` Ah , yes , the ` Facheux ; ' yes , I recollect . 
Well , I was thinking a prologue would admirably suit your divertissement . '' 
`` Doubtless it would suit capitally . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are of my opinion ? '' 
`` So much so , that I have asked you to write this very prologue . '' 
`` You asked me to write it ? '' 
`` Yes , you , and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson , who is engaged upon it at this moment . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is what Pelisson is doing , then ? 
I ` faith , my dear Moliere , you are indeed often right . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` When you call me absent-minded . 
It is a monstrous defect ; I will cure myself of it , and do your prologue for you . '' 
`` But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it ! 
- '' `` Ah , true , miserable rascal that I am ! 
Loret was indeed right in saying I was a poor creature . '' 
`` It was not Loret who said so , my friend . '' 
`` Well , then , whoever said so , 't is the same to me ! 
And so your divertissement is called the ` Facheux ? ' 
Well , can you make heureux rhyme with facheux ? '' 
`` If obliged , yes . '' 
`` And even with capriceux . '' 
`` Oh , no , no . '' 
`` It would be hazardous , and yet why so ? '' 
`` There is too great a difference in the cadences . '' 
`` I was fancying , '' said La Fontaine , leaving Moliere for Loret - `` I was fancying - '' `` What were you fancying ? '' 
said Loret , in the middle of a sentence . 
`` Make haste . '' 
`` You are writing the prologue to the ` Facheux , ' are you not ? '' 
`` No ! 
mordieu ! 
it is Pelisson . '' 
`` Ah , Pelisson , '' cried La Fontaine , going over to him , `` I was fancying , '' he continued , `` that the nymph of Vaux - '' `` Ah , beautiful ! ''
