`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? '' 
`` Bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` Well ! 
this M. d'Herblay , who also knew the secret , the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` So hotly pursued , that if he were dead , she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head , to satisfy her he would never speak again . '' 
`` And is that the desire of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` An order is given for it . '' 
`` This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for , madame . '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is well known where he is . '' 
Colbert looked at the duchesse . 
`` Say where , madame . '' 
`` He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` He shall be taken . '' 
It was now the duchesse 's turn to smile . 
`` Do not fancy the capture so easy , '' said she ; `` do not promise it so lightly . '' 
`` Why not , madame ? '' 
`` Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and where you please . '' 
`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? '' 
`` I ? 
- I ask you nothing of the kind ! '' 
`` I thought you did , madame . 
But as I have been mistaken , we will leave him alone ; the king has said nothing about him . '' 
The duchesse bit her nails . 
`` Besides , '' continued Colbert , `` what a poor capture would this bishop be ! 
A bishop game for a king ! 
Oh ! 
no , no ; I will not even take the slightest notice of him . '' 
The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself . 
`` Game for a woman ! '' 
said she . 
`` Is not the queen a woman ? 
If she wishes M. d'Herblay arrested , she has her reasons . 
Besides , is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
never mind that , '' said Colbert . 
`` This man shall be spared , if he is not the enemy of the king . 
Is that displeasing to you ? '' 
`` I say nothing . '' 
`` Yes - you wish to see him in prison , in the Bastile , for instance . '' 
`` I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` I will speak to the king about it ; he will clear up the point . '' 
`` And whilst waiting for that enlightenment , Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes will have escaped . 
I would do so . '' 
`` Escaped ! 
he ! 
and whither should he escape ? 
Europe is ours , in will , if not in fact . '' 
`` He will always find an asylum , monsieur . 
It is evident you know nothing of the man you have to do with . 
You do not know D'Herblay ; you do not know Aramis . 
He was one of those four musketeers who , under the late king , made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble , and who , during the regency , gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin . '' 
`` But , madame , what can he do , unless he has a kingdom to back him ? '' 
`` He has one , monsieur . '' 
`` A kingdom , he ! 
what , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I repeat to you , monsieur , that if he wants a kingdom , he either has it or will have it . '' 
`` Well , as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape , madame , I promise you he shall not escape . '' 
`` Belle-Isle is fortified , M. Colbert , and fortified by him . '' 
`` If Belle-Isle were also defended by him , Belle-Isle is not impregnable ; and if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle , well , madame , the place shall be besieged , and he will be taken . '' 
`` You may be very certain , monsieur , that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily , and you will be magnificently rewarded ; but what shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man ? '' 
`` That when once taken , he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape . '' 
`` Very well , Monsieur Colbert , and we may say , that , dating from this instant , we have formed a solid alliance , that is , you and I , and that I am absolutely at your service . '' 
`` It is I , madame , who place myself at yours . 
This Chevalier d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy , is he not ? '' 
`` Much more . '' 
`` A secret ambassador ? '' 
`` Higher still . '' 
`` Stop - King Phillip III . 
of Spain is a bigot . 
He is , perhaps , the confessor of Phillip III . '' 
`` You must go higher even than that . '' 
`` Mordieu ! '' 
cried Colbert , who forgot himself so far as to swear in the presence of this great lady , of this old friend of the queen-mother . 
`` He must then be the general of the Jesuits . '' 
`` I believe you have guessed it at last , '' replied the duchesse . 
`` Ah ! 
then , madame , this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him ; and we must make haste , too . '' 
`` Such was my opinion , monsieur , but I did not dare to give it you . ''
