The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexandre Dumas : The Prisoner . 
Since Aramis 's singular transformation into a confessor of the order , Baisemeaux was no longer the same man . 
Up to that period , the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor 's estimation was that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude ; but now he felt himself an inferior , and that Aramis was his master . 
He himself lighted a lantern , summoned a turnkey , and said , returning to Aramis , `` I am at your orders , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis merely nodded his head , as much as to say , `` Very good '' ; and signed to him with his hand to lead the way . 
Baisemeaux advanced , and Aramis followed him . 
It was a calm and lovely starlit night ; the steps of three men resounded on the flags of the terraces , and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer 's girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers , as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach . 
It might have been said that the alteration effected in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners . 
The turnkey , the same who , on Aramis 's first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious , was now not only silent , but impassible . 
He held his head down , and seemed afraid to keep his ears open . 
In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudiere , the two first stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly ; for Baisemeaux , though far from disobeying , was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey . 
On arriving at the door , Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner 's chamber ; but Aramis , stopping him on the threshold , said , `` The rules do not allow the governor to hear the prisoner 's confession . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed , and made way for Aramis , who took the lantern and entered ; and then signed to them to close the door behind him . 
For an instant he remained standing , listening whether Baisemeaux and the turnkey had retired ; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their descending footsteps that they had left the tower , he put the lantern on the table and gazed around . 
On a bed of green serge , similar in all respect to the other beds in the Bastile , save that it was newer , and under curtains half-drawn , reposed a young man , to whom we have already once before introduced Aramis . 
According to custom , the prisoner was without a light . 
At the hour of curfew , he was bound to extinguish his lamp , and we perceive how much he was favored , in being allowed to keep it burning even till then . 
Near the bed a large leathern armchair , with twisted legs , sustained his clothes . 
A little table - without pens , books , paper , or ink - stood neglected in sadness near the window ; while several plates , still unemptied , showed that the prisoner had scarcely touched his evening meal . 
Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed , his face half concealed by his arms . 
The arrival of a visitor did not caused any change of position ; either he was waiting in expectation , or was asleep . 
Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern , pushed back the armchair , and approached the bed with an evident mixture of interest and respect . 
The young man raised his head . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said he . 
`` You desired a confessor ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Because you were ill ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Very ill ? '' 
The young man gave Aramis a piercing glance , and answered , `` I thank you . '' 
After a moment 's silence , `` I have seen you before , '' he continued . 
Aramis bowed . 
Doubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold , crafty , and imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of Vannes was little reassuring to one in his situation , for he added , `` I am better . '' 
`` And so ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Why , then - being better , I have no longer the same need of a confessor , I think . '' 
`` Not even of the hair-cloth , which the note you found in your bread informed you of ? '' 
The young man started ; but before he had either assented or denied , Aramis continued , `` Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to hear an important revelation ? '' 
`` If it be so , '' said the young man , sinking again on his pillow , `` it is different ; I am listening . '' 
Aramis then looked at him more closely , and was struck with the easy majesty of his mien , one which can never be acquired unless Heaven has implanted it in the blood or heart . 
`` Sit down , monsieur , '' said the prisoner . 
Aramis bowed and obeyed . 
`` How does the Bastile agree with you ? '' 
asked the bishop . 
`` Very well . '' 
`` You do not suffer ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` You have nothing to regret ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Not even your liberty ? '' 
`` What do you call liberty , monsieur ? '' 
asked the prisoner , with the tone of a man who is preparing for a struggle . 
`` I call liberty , the flowers , the air , light , the stars , the happiness of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to carry you . '' 
The young man smiled , whether in resignation or contempt , it was difficult to tell . 
`` Look , '' said he , `` I have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor 's garden ; this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath my gaze ; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their perfumes , filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it . 
Look now on these two roses ; even among roses these are beautiful , and the rose is the most beautiful of flowers . 
Why , then , do you bid me desire other flowers when I possess the loveliest of all ? '' 
Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise . 
`` If flowers constitute liberty , '' sadly resumed the captive , `` I am free , for I possess them . '' 
`` But the air ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` air is so necessary to life ! '' 
`` Well , monsieur , '' returned the prisoner ; `` draw near to the window ; it is open . 
Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages of hail and lightning , exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle breezes . 
It caresses my face . 
When mounted on the back of this armchair , with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself , I fancy I am swimming the wide expanse before me . '' 
The countenance of Aramis darkened as the young man continued : `` Light I have ! 
what is better than light ? 
I have the sun , a friend who comes to visit me every day without the permission of the governor or the jailer 's company . 
He comes in at the window , and traces in my room a square the shape of the window , which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor . 
This luminous square increases from ten o'clock till midday , and decreases from one till three slowly , as if , having hastened to my presence , it sorrowed at bidding me farewell . 
When its last ray disappears I have enjoyed its presence for five hours . 
Is not that sufficient ? 
I have been told that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries , and laborers who toil in mines , who never behold it at all . '' 
Aramis wiped the drops from his brow . 
`` As to the stars which are so delightful to view , '' continued the young man , `` they all resemble each other save in size and brilliancy . 
I am a favored mortal , for if you had not lighted that candle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was gazing at from my couch before your arrival , whose silvery rays were stealing through my brain . '' 
Aramis lowered his head ; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter flow of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive . 
`` So much , then , for the flowers , the air , the daylight , and the stars , '' tranquilly continued the young man ; `` there remains but exercise . 
Do I not walk all day in the governor 's garden if it is fine - here if it rains ? 
in the fresh air if it is warm ; in perfect warmth , thanks to my winter stove , if it be cold ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , do you fancy , '' continued the prisoner , not without bitterness , `` that men have not done everything for me that a man can hope for or desire ? '' 
`` Men ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` be it so ; but it seems to me you are forgetting Heaven . '' 
`` Indeed I have forgotten Heaven , '' murmured the prisoner , with emotion ; `` but why do you mention it ? 
Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of Heaven ? '' 
Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth , who possessed the resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist . 
`` Is not Heaven in everything ? '' 
he murmured in a reproachful tone . 
`` Say rather , at the end of everything , '' answered the prisoner , firmly . 
`` Be it so , '' said Aramis ; `` but let us return to our starting-point . '' 
`` I ask nothing better , '' returned the young man . 
`` I am your confessor . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , then , you ought , as a penitent , to tell me the truth . '' 
`` My whole desire is to tell it you . '' 
`` Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been imprisoned . 
What crime , then , have you committed ? ''
