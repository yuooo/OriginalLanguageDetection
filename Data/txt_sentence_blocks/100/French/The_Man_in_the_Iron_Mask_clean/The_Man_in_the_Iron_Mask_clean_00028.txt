`` That is merely an act of graceful attention , '' replied Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went up to his friend , took hold of both his hands , and looking him full in the eyes , said , `` Aramis , do you still care for me a very little ? '' 
`` What a question to ask ! '' 
`` Very good . 
One favor , then . 
Why did you take some patterns of the king 's costumes at Percerin 's ? '' 
`` Come with me and ask poor Lebrun , who has been working upon them for the last two days and nights . '' 
`` Aramis , that may be truth for everybody else , but for me - '' `` Upon my word , D'Artagnan , you astonish me . '' 
`` Be a little considerate . 
Tell me the exact truth ; you would not like anything disagreeable to happen to me , would you ? '' 
`` My dear friend , you are becoming quite incomprehensible . 
What suspicion can you have possibly got hold of ? '' 
`` Do you believe in my instinctive feelings ? 
Formerly you used to have faith in them . 
Well , then , an instinct tells me that you have some concealed project on foot . '' 
`` I - a project ? '' 
`` I am convinced of it . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
`` I am not only sure of it , but I would even swear it . '' 
`` Indeed , D'Artagnan , you cause me the greatest pain . 
Is it likely , if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you , I should tell you about it ? 
If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed , should I not have long ago divulged it ? '' 
`` No , Aramis , no . 
There are certain projects which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives . '' 
`` In that case , my dear fellow , '' returned the bishop , laughing , `` the only thing now is , that the ` opportunity ' has not yet arrived . '' 
D'Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression . 
`` Oh , friendship , friendship ! '' 
he said , `` what an idle word you are ! 
Here is a man who , if I were but to ask it , would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake . '' 
`` You are right , '' said Aramis , nobly . 
`` And this man , who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me , will not open up before me the least corner in his heart . 
Friendship , I repeat , is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow - a lure , like everything else in this bright , dazzling world . '' 
`` It is not thus you should speak of our friendship , '' replied the bishop , in a firm , assured voice ; `` for ours is not of the same nature as those of which you have been speaking . '' 
`` Look at us , Aramis ; three out of the old ` four . ' 
You are deceiving me ; I suspect you ; and Porthos is fast asleep . 
An admirable trio of friends , do n't you think so ? 
What an affecting relic of the former dear old times ! '' 
`` I can only tell you one thing , D'Artagnan , and I swear it on the Bible : I love you just as I used to do . 
If I ever suspect you , it is on account of others , and not on account of either of us . 
In everything I may do , and should happen to succeed in , you will find your fourth . 
Will you promise me the same favor ? '' 
`` If I am not mistaken , Aramis , your words - at the moment you pronounce them - are full of generous feeling . '' 
`` Such a thing is very possible . '' 
`` You are conspiring against M. Colbert . 
If that be all , mordioux , tell me so at once . 
I have the instrument in my own hand , and will pull out the tooth easily enough . '' 
Aramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his haughty features . 
`` And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert , what harm would there be in that ? '' 
`` No , no ; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand , and it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of the king 's costumes . 
Oh ! 
Aramis , we are not enemies , remember - we are brothers . 
Tell me what you wish to undertake , and , upon the word of a D'Artagnan , if I can not help you , I will swear to remain neuter . '' 
`` I am undertaking nothing , '' said Aramis . 
`` Aramis , a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of light within my darkness : it is a voice that has never yet deceived me . 
It is the king you are conspiring against . '' 
`` The king ? '' 
exclaimed the bishop , pretending to be annoyed . 
`` Your face will not convince me ; the king , I repeat . '' 
`` Will you help me ? '' 
said Aramis , smiling ironically . 
`` Aramis , I will do more than help you - I will do more than remain neuter - I will save you . '' 
`` You are mad , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` I am the wiser of the two , in this matter . '' 
`` You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king ! '' 
`` Who spoke of such a thing ? '' 
smiled the musketeer . 
`` Well , let us understand one another . 
I do not see what any one can do to a legitimate king as ours is , if he does not assassinate him . '' 
D'Artagnan did not say a word . 
`` Besides , you have your guards and your musketeers here , '' said the bishop . 
`` True . '' 
`` You are not in M. Fouquet 's house , but in your own . '' 
`` True ; but in spite of that , Aramis , grant me , for pity 's sake , one single word of a true friend . '' 
`` A true friend 's word is ever truth itself . 
If I think of touching , even with my finger , the son of Anne of Austria , the true king of this realm of France - if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before his throne - if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow , here at Vaux , will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed - may Heaven 's lightning blast me where I stand ! '' 
Aramis had pronounced these words with his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom , where D'Artagnan , seated with his back towards the alcove , could not suspect that any one was lying concealed . 
The earnestness of his words , the studied slowness with which he pronounced them , the solemnity of his oath , gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction . 
He took hold of both Aramis 's hands , and shook them cordially . 
Aramis had endured reproaches without turning pale , and had blushed as he listened to words of praise . 
D'Artagnan , deceived , did him honor ; but D'Artagnan , trustful and reliant , made him feel ashamed . 
`` Are you going away ? '' 
he said , as he embraced him , in order to conceal the flush on his face . 
`` Yes . 
Duty summons me . 
I have to get the watch-word . 
It seems I am to be lodged in the king 's ante-room . 
Where does Porthos sleep ? '' 
`` Take him away with you , if you like , for he rumbles through his sleepy nose like a park of artillery . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he does not stay with you , then ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not the least in the world . 
He has a chamber to himself , but I do n't know where . '' 
`` Very good ! '' 
said the musketeer ; from whom this separation of the two associates removed his last suspicion , and he touched Porthos lightly on the shoulder ; the latter replied by a loud yawn . 
`` Come , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` What , D'Artagnan , my dear fellow , is that you ? 
What a lucky chance ! 
Oh , yes - true ; I have forgotten ; I am at the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Yes ; and your beautiful dress , too . ''
