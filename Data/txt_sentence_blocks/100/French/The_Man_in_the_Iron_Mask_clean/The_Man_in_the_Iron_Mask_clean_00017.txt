he said . 
`` I am off to Paris , when you shall have given a certain letter . '' 
`` For whom ? '' 
`` M. de Lyonne . '' 
`` And what do you want with Lyonne ? '' 
`` I wish to make him sign a lettre de cachet . '' '' 
` Lettre de cachet ! ' 
Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile ? '' 
`` On the contrary - to let somebody out . '' 
`` And who ? '' 
`` A poor devil - a youth , a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years , for two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits . '' '' 
` Two Latin verses ! ' 
and , for ` two Latin verses , ' the miserable being has been in prison for ten years ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` And has committed no other crime ? '' 
`` Beyond this , he is as innocent as you or I. '' `` On your word ? '' 
`` On my honor ! '' 
`` And his name is - '' `` Seldon . '' 
`` Yes . 
- But it is too bad . 
You knew this , and you never told me ! '' '' 
'T was only yesterday his mother applied to me , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the woman is poor ! '' 
`` In the deepest misery . '' 
`` Heaven , '' said Fouquet , `` sometimes bears with such injustice on earth , that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence . 
Stay , M. d'Herblay . '' 
And Fouquet , taking a pen , wrote a few rapid lines to his colleague Lyonne . 
Aramis took the letter and made ready to go . 
`` Wait , '' said Fouquet . 
He opened his drawer , and took out ten government notes which were there , each for a thousand francs . 
`` Stay , '' he said ; `` set the son at liberty , and give this to the mother ; but , above all , do not tell her - '' `` What , monseigneur ? '' 
`` That she is ten thousand livres richer than I . 
She would say I am but a poor superintendent ! 
Go ! 
and I pray that God will bless those who are mindful of his poor ! '' 
`` So also do I pray , '' replied Aramis , kissing Fouquet 's hand . 
And he went out quickly , carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes for Seldon 's mother , and taking up Moliere , who was beginning to lose patience . 
: Another Supper at the Bastile . 
Seven o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile , that famous clock , which , like all the accessories of the state prison , the very use of which is a torture , recalled to the prisoners ' minds the destination of every hour of their punishment . 
The time-piece of the Bastile , adorned with figures , like most of the clocks of the period , represented St. Peter in bonds . 
It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives . 
The doors , grating on their enormous hinges , opened for the passage of the baskets and trays of provisions , the abundance and the delicacy of which , as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us , was regulated by the condition in life of the prisoner . 
We understand on this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux , sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies , head cook of the royal fortress , whose trays , full-laden , were ascending the steep staircases , carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages . 
This same hour was that of M. le gouverneur 's supper also . 
He had a guest to - day , and the spit turned more heavily than usual . 
Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation . 
As for M. de Baisemeaux , with the facility of vulgar people , he gave himself up entirely upon this point of his guest 's freedom . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur . '' 
`` By no means , '' said Aramis ; `` call me monsieur ; I am booted . '' 
`` Do you know , monsieur , of whom you remind me this evening ? '' 
`` No ! 
faith , '' said Aramis , taking up his glass ; `` but I hope I remind you of a capital guest . '' 
`` You remind me of two , monsieur . 
Francois , shut the window ; the wind may annoy his greatness . '' 
`` And let him go , '' added Aramis . 
`` The supper is completely served , and we shall eat it very well without waiters . 
I like exceedingly to be tete-a - tete when I am with a friend . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed respectfully . 
`` I like exceedingly , '' continued Aramis , `` to help myself . '' 
`` Retire , Francois , '' cried Baisemeaux . 
`` I was saying that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons ; one very illustrious , the late cardinal , the great Cardinal de la Rochelle , who wore boots like you . '' 
`` Indeed , '' said Aramis ; `` and the other ? '' 
`` The other was a certain musketeer , very handsome , very brave , very adventurous , very fortunate , who , from being abbe , turned musketeer , and from musketeer turned abbe . '' 
Aramis condescended to smile . 
`` From abbe , '' continued Baisemeaux , encouraged by Aramis 's smile - `` from abbe , bishop - and from bishop - '' `` Ah ! 
stay there , I beg , '' exclaimed Aramis . 
`` I have just said , monsieur , that you gave me the idea of a cardinal . '' 
`` Enough , dear M. Baisemeaux . 
As you said , I have on the boots of a cavalier , but I do not intend , for all that , to embroil myself with the church this evening . '' 
`` But you have wicked intentions , nevertheless , monseigneur . '' 
`` Oh , yes , wicked , I own , as everything mundane is . '' 
`` You traverse the town and the streets in disguise ? '' 
`` In disguise , as you say . '' 
`` And you still make use of your sword ? '' 
`` Yes , I should think so ; but only when I am compelled . 
Do me the pleasure to summon Francois . '' 
`` Have you no wine there ? '' '' 
'T is not for wine , but because it is hot here , and the window is shut . '' 
`` I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the arrival of couriers . '' 
`` Ah , yes . 
You hear them when the window is open ? '' 
`` But too well , and that disturbs me . 
You understand ? '' 
`` Nevertheless I am suffocated . 
Francois . '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Open the windows , I pray you , Master Francois , '' said Aramis . 
`` You will allow him , dear M. Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` You are at home here , '' answered the governor . 
The window was opened . 
`` Do you not think , '' said M. de Baisemeaux , `` that you will find yourself very lonely , now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at Blois ? 
He is a very old friend , is he not ? '' 
`` You know it as I do , Baisemeaux , seeing that you were in the musketeers with us . '' 
`` Bah ! 
with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years . '' 
`` And you are right .
