Brienne , Rose , and de Saint-Aignan , in general so attentive and obsequious , should scarcely take the least notice , as he , the surintendant , passed . 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers , he whom the king no longer called anything but Fouquet ? 
He raised his head , determined to look every one and everything bravely in the face , and entered the king 's apartment , where a little bell , which we already know , had already announced him to his majesty . 
The king , without rising , nodded to him , and with interest : `` Well ! 
how are you , Monsieur Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am in a high fever , '' replied the surintendant ; `` but I am at the king 's service . '' 
`` That is well ; the States assemble to-morrow ; have you a speech ready ? '' 
Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment . 
`` I have not , sire , '' replied he ; `` but I will improvise one . 
I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . '' 
The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? '' 
`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . '' 
`` Rest yourself , Monsieur Fouquet , do not throw away your strength ; the session of the States will be short , and when my secretaries shall have closed it , I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a fortnight . '' 
`` Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the States ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` Not to me , the surintendant of the finances ? '' 
`` Rest yourself , I beg you ; that is all I have to say to you . '' 
Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head . 
He was evidently busy with some uneasy thought . 
This uneasiness struck the king . 
`` Are you angry at having to rest yourself , M. Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , sire , I am not accustomed to take rest . '' 
`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he . 
`` If his first word is severe , '' again thought Fouquet ; `` if he becomes angry , or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext , how shall I extricate myself ? 
Let us smooth the declivity a little . 
Gourville was right . '' 
`` Sire , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the point of dispensing with my labor , may I not be allowed to be absent from the council of to-morrow ? 
I could pass the day in bed , and will entreat the king to grant me his physician , that we may endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever . '' 
`` So be it , Monsieur Fouquet , it shall be as you desire ; you shall have a holiday to-morrow , you shall have the physician , and shall be restored to health . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
said Fouquet , bowing . 
Then , opening his game : `` Shall I not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle - Isle ? '' 
And he looked Louis full in the face , to judge of the effect of such a proposal . 
The king blushed again . 
`` Do you know , '' replied he , endeavoring to smile , `` that you have just said , ` My residence of Belle-Isle ' ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Well ! 
do you not remember , '' continued the king in the same cheerful tone , `` that you gave me Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` That is true again , sire . 
Only , as you have not taken it , you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it . '' 
`` I mean to do so . '' 
`` That was , besides , your majesty 's intention as well as mine ; and I can not express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the king 's regiments from Paris to help take possession . '' 
The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that alone . 
`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . '' 
`` You have a boat of your own , nevertheless ? '' 
`` I have five ; but they are all in port , or at Paimboeuf ; and to join them , or bring them hither , would require at least twenty-four hours . 
Have I any occasion to send a courier ? 
Must I do so ? '' 
`` Wait a little , put an end to the fever , - wait till to-morrow . '' 
`` That is true . 
Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred other ideas ? '' 
replied Fouquet , now perfectly convinced and very pale . 
The king started , and stretched his hand out towards his little bell , but Fouquet prevented his ringing . 
`` Sire , '' said he , `` I have an ague - I am trembling with cold .
