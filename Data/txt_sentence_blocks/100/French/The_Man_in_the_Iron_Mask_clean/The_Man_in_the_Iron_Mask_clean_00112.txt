`` Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken , monsieur le capitaine ? '' 
continued the falconer . 
`` It must be full two hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol . '' 
`` Two hundred and sixty to go , and as many to return , '' said D'Artagnan , quietly . 
`` And , '' said the falconer , `` is he well ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Why , poor M. Fouquet , '' continued the falconer , in a low voice . 
The keeper of the harriers had prudently withdrawn . 
`` No , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` the poor man frets terribly ; he can not comprehend how imprisonment can be a favor ; he says that parliament absolved him by banishing him , and banishment is , or should be , liberty . 
He can not imagine that they had sworn his death , and that to save his life from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to Heaven . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold , '' replied the falconer ; `` it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor of the Bastile , and that the execution was ordered . '' 
`` Enough ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , pensively , and with a view of cutting short the conversation . 
`` Yes , '' said the keeper of the harriers , drawing towards them , `` M. Fouquet is now at Pignerol ; he has richly deserved it . 
He had the good fortune to be conducted there by you ; he robbed the king sufficiently . '' 
D'Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks , and said to him , `` Monsieur , if any one told me you had eaten your dogs ' meat , not only would I refuse to believe it ; but still more , if you were condemned to the lash or to jail for it , I should pity you and would not allow people to speak ill of you . 
And yet , monsieur , honest man as you may be , I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was . '' 
After having undergone this sharp rebuke , the keeper of the harriers hung his head , and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of him nearer to D'Artagnan . 
`` He is content , '' said the falconer , in a low voice , to the musketeer ; `` we all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays ; if he were a falconer he would not talk in that way . '' 
D'Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political question resolved by the discontent of such humble interest . 
He for a moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant , the crumbling of his fortunes , and the melancholy death that awaited him ; and to conclude , `` Did M. Fouquet love falconry ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh , passionately , monsieur ! '' 
repeated the falconer , with an accent of bitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other to pass , and continued to advance . 
They could already catch glimpses of the huntsmen at the issue of the wood , the feathers of the outriders passing like shooting stars across the clearings , and the white horses skirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions . 
`` But , '' resumed D'Artagnan , `` will the sport last long ? 
Pray , give us a good swift bird , for I am very tired . 
Is it a heron or a swan ? '' 
`` Both , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the falconer ; `` but you need not be alarmed ; the king is not much of a sportsman ; he does not take the field on his own account , he only wishes to amuse the ladies . '' 
The words `` to amuse the ladies '' were so strongly accented they set D'Artagnan thinking . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said he , looking keenly at the falconer . 
The keeper of the harriers smiled , no doubt with a view of making it up with the musketeer . 
`` Oh ! 
you may safely laugh , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I know nothing of current news ; I only arrived yesterday , after a month 's absence . 
I left the court mourning the death of the queen-mother . 
The king was not willing to take any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria ; but everything comes to an end in this world . 
Well ! 
then he is no longer sad ? 
So much the better . '' 
-LRB- 8 -RRB- `` And everything begins as well as ends , '' said the keeper with a coarse laugh . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , a second time , - he burned to know , but dignity would not allow him to interrogate people below him , - `` there is something beginning , then , it seems ? '' 
The keeper gave him a significant wink ; but D'Artagnan was unwilling to learn anything from this man . 
`` Shall we see the king early ? '' 
asked he of the falconer . 
`` At seven o'clock , monsieur , I shall fly the birds . '' 
`` Who comes with the king ? 
How is Madame ? 
How is the queen ? '' 
`` Better , monsieur . '' 
`` Has she been ill , then ? '' 
`` Monsieur , since the last chagrin she suffered , her majesty has been unwell . '' 
`` What chagrin ? 
You need not fancy your news is old . 
I have but just returned . '' 
`` It appears that the queen , a little neglected since the death of her mother-in-law , complained to the king , who answered her , - ` Do I not sleep at home every night , madame ? 
What more do you expect ? ' '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , - `` poor woman ! 
She must heartily hate Mademoiselle de la Valliere . '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
not Mademoiselle de la Valliere , '' replied the falconer . 
`` Who then - '' The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this conversation . 
It summoned the dogs and the hawks . 
The falconer and his companions set off immediately , leaving D'Artagnan alone in the midst of the suspended sentence . 
The king appeared at a distance , surrounded by ladies and horsemen . 
All the troop advanced in beautiful order , at a foot 's pace , the horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses . 
There was an animation in the scene , a mirage of light , of which nothing now can give an idea , unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric spectacle . 
D'Artagnan , with an eye a little , just a little , dimmed by age , distinguished behind the group three carriages . 
The first was intended for the queen ; it was empty . 
D'Artagnan , who did not see Mademoiselle de la Valliere by the king 's side , on looking about for her , saw her in the second carriage . 
She was alone with two of her women , who seemed as dull as their mistress . 
On the left hand of the king , upon a high-spirited horse , restrained by a bold and skillful hand , shone a lady of most dazzling beauty . 
The king smiled upon her , and she smiled upon the king . 
Loud laughter followed every word she uttered . 
`` I must know that woman , '' thought the musketeer ; `` who can she be ? '' 
And he stooped towards his friend , the falconer , to whom he addressed the question he had put to himself . 
The falconer was about to reply , when the king , perceiving D'Artagnan , `` Ah , comte ! '' 
said he , `` you are amongst us once more then ! 
Why have I not seen you ? '' 
`` Sire , '' replied the captain , `` because your majesty was asleep when I arrived , and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning . '' 
`` Still the same , '' said Louis , in a loud voice , denoting satisfaction . 
`` Take some rest , comte ; I command you to do so . 
You will dine with me to - day . '' 
A murmur of admiration surrounded D'Artagnan like a caress . 
Every one was eager to salute him . 
Dining with the king was an honor his majesty was not so prodigal of as Henry IV . 
had been . 
The king passed a few steps in advance , and D'Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh group , among whom shone Colbert . 
`` Good-day , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the minister , with marked affability , `` have you had a pleasant journey ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , bowing to the neck of his horse . 
`` I heard the king invite you to his table for this evening , '' continued the minister ; `` you will meet an old friend there . '' 
`` An old friend of mine ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , plunging painfully into the dark waves of the past , which had swallowed up for him so many friendships and so many hatreds . 
`` M. le Duc d'Almeda , who is arrived this morning from Spain . '' 
`` The Duc d'Almeda ? ''
