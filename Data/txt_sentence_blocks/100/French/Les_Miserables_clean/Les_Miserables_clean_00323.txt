`` Well ? '' 
`` I 'm sure that I know him . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` I 'm willing that they should cut my throat , and I 'm ready to swear that I never said either you , thou , or I , in my life , if I do n't know that Parisian . '' 
-LSB- pantinois . -RSB- 
`` Paris in Pantin to-day . '' 
`` Can you see the bride if you stoop down ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` And the bridegroom ? '' 
`` There 's no bridegroom in that trap . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` Unless it 's the old fellow . '' 
`` Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low . '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
`` Never mind , that old cove who has something the matter with his paw I know , and that I 'm positive . '' 
`` And what good does it do to know him ? '' 
`` No one can tell . 
Sometimes it does ! '' 
`` I do n't care a hang for old fellows , that I do n't ! '' 
`` I know him . '' 
`` Know him , if you want to . '' 
`` How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party ? '' 
`` We are in it , too . '' 
`` Where does that wedding come from ? '' 
`` How should I know ? '' 
`` Listen . '' 
`` Well , what ? '' 
`` There 's one thing you ought to do . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` Get off of our trap and spin that wedding . '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` To find out where it goes , and what it is . 
Hurry up and jump down , trot , my girl , your legs are young . '' 
`` I ca n't quit the vehicle . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` I 'm hired . '' 
`` Ah , the devil ! '' 
`` I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture . '' 
`` That 's true . '' 
`` If I leave the cart , the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me . 
You know that well enough . '' 
`` Yes , I do . '' 
`` I 'm bought by the government for to-day . '' 
`` All the same , that old fellow bothers me . '' 
`` Do the old fellows bother you ? 
But you 're not a young girl . '' 
`` He 's in the first carriage . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` In the bride 's trap . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` So he is the father . '' 
`` What concern is that of mine ? '' 
`` I tell you that he 's the father . '' 
`` As if he were the only father . '' 
`` Listen . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I ca n't go out otherwise than masked . 
Here I 'm concealed , no one knows that I 'm here . 
But to-morrow , there will be no more maskers . 
It 's Ash Wednesday . 
I run the risk of being nabbed . 
I must sneak back into my hole . 
But you are free . '' 
`` Not particularly . '' 
`` More than I am , at any rate . '' 
`` Well , what of that ? '' 
`` You must try to find out where that wedding-party went to . '' 
`` Where it went ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I know . '' 
`` Where is it going then ? '' 
`` To the Cadran-Bleu . '' 
`` In the first place , it 's not in that direction . '' 
`` Well ! 
to la Rapee . '' 
`` Or elsewhere . '' 
`` It 's free . 
Wedding-parties are at liberty . '' 
`` That 's not the point at all . 
I tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is , who that old cove belongs to , and where that wedding pair lives . '' 
`` I like that ! 
that would be queer . 
It 's so easy to find out a wedding-party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday , a week afterwards . 
A pin in a hay-mow ! 
It ai n't possible ! '' 
`` That do n't matter . 
You must try . 
You understand me , Azelma . '' 
The two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard , in opposite directions , and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the `` trap '' of the bride . 
JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING To realize one 's dream . 
To whom is this accorded ? 
There must be elections for this in heaven ; we are all candidates , unknown to ourselves ; the angels vote . 
Cosette and Marius had been elected . 
Cosette , both at the mayor 's office and at church , was dazzling and touching . 
Toussaint , assisted by Nicolette , had dressed her . 
Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta , her robe of Binche guipure , a veil of English point , a necklace of fine pearls , a wreath of orange flowers ; all this was white , and , from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth . 
It was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light . 
One would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess . 
Marius ' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed ; here and there , beneath the thick curls , pale lines -- the scars of the barricade -- were visible . 
The grandfather , haughty , with head held high , amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of Barras , escorted Cosette .
