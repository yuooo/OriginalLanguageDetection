But I recognize him ! 
Ah ! 
I recognize him . 
I knew him at once ! 
What ! 
Did n't it force itself on you ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But I told you : ` Pay attention ! ' 
Why , it is his figure , it is his face , only older , -- there are people who do not grow old , I do n't know how they manage it , -- it is the very sound of his voice . 
He is better dressed , that is all ! 
Ah ! 
you mysterious old devil , I 've got you , that I have ! '' 
He paused , and said to his daughters : -- `` Get out of here , you ! 
-- It 's queer that it did n't strike you ! '' 
They arose to obey . 
The mother stammered : -- `` With her injured hand . '' 
`` The air will do it good , '' said Jondrette . 
`` Be off . '' 
It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply . 
The two girls departed . 
At the moment when they were about to pass through the door , the father detained the elder by the arm , and said to her with a peculiar accent : -- `` You will be here at five o'clock precisely . 
Both of you . 
I shall need you . '' 
Marius redoubled his attention . 
On being left alone with his wife , Jondrette began to pace the room again , and made the tour of it two or three times in silence . 
Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman 's chemise which he wore into his trousers . 
All at once , he turned to the female Jondrette , folded his arms and exclaimed : -- `` And would you like to have me tell you something ? 
The young lady -- '' `` Well , what ? '' 
retorted his wife , `` the young lady ? '' 
Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking . 
He listened with ardent anxiety . 
His whole life was in his ears . 
But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper . 
Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud : -- `` It is she ! '' 
`` That one ? '' 
said his wife . 
`` That very one , '' said the husband . 
No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother 's words . 
Surprise , rage , hate , wrath , were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation . 
The pronunciation of a few words , the name , no doubt , which her husband had whispered in her ear , had sufficed to rouse this huge , somnolent woman , and from being repulsive she became terrible . 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
she cried . 
`` When I think that my daughters are going barefoot , and have not a gown to their backs ! 
What ! 
A satin pelisse , a velvet bonnet , boots , and everything ; more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes ! 
so that one would think she was a lady ! 
No , you are mistaken ! 
Why , in the first place , the other was hideous , and this one is not so bad-looking ! 
She really is not bad-looking ! 
It ca n't be she ! '' 
`` I tell you that it is she . 
You will see . '' 
At this absolute assertion , the Jondrette woman raised her large , red , blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression . 
At that moment , she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband . 
She was a sow with the look of a tigress . 
`` What ! '' 
she resumed , `` that horrible , beautiful young lady , who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity , -- she is that beggar brat ! 
Oh ! 
I should like to kick her stomach in for her ! '' 
She sprang off of the bed , and remained standing for a moment , her hair in disorder , her nostrils dilating , her mouth half open , her fists clenched and drawn back . 
Then she fell back on the bed once more . 
The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female . 
After a silence lasting several minutes , he approached the female Jondrette , and halted in front of her , with folded arms , as he had done a moment before : -- `` And shall I tell you another thing ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
she asked . 
He answered in a low , curt voice : -- `` My fortune is made . '' 
The woman stared at him with the look that signifies : `` Is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad ? '' 
He went on : -- `` Thunder ! 
It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire , - die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread ! 
I have had enough of misery ! 
my share and other people 's share ! 
I am not joking any longer , I do n't find it comic any more , I 've had enough of puns , good God ! 
no more farces , Eternal Father ! 
I want to eat till I am full , I want to drink my fill ! 
to gormandize ! 
to sleep ! 
to do nothing ! 
I want to have my turn , so I do , come now ! 
before I die ! 
I want to be a bit of a millionnaire ! '' 
He took a turn round the hovel , and added : -- `` Like other people . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
asked the woman . 
He shook his head , winked , screwed up one eye , and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration : -- `` What do I mean by that ? 
Listen ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
muttered the woman , `` not so loud ! 
These are matters which must not be overheard . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Who 's here ? 
Our neighbor ? 
I saw him go out a little while ago . 
Besides , he does n't listen , the big booby . 
And I tell you that I saw him go out . '' 
Nevertheless , by a sort of instinct , Jondrette lowered his voice , although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words . 
One favorable circumstance , which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard . 
This is what Marius heard : -- `` Listen carefully . 
The Croesus is caught , or as good as caught ! 
That 's all settled already . 
Everything is arranged .
