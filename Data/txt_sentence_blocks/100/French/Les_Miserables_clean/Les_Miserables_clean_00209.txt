I must sew it up for you . '' 
She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over : -- `` You do n't seem glad to see me . '' 
Marius held his peace ; she remained silent for a moment , then exclaimed : -- `` But if I choose , nevertheless , I could force you to look glad ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
you used to call me thou , '' she retorted . 
`` Well , then , what dost thou mean ? '' 
She bit her lips ; she seemed to hesitate , as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict . 
At last she appeared to come to a decision . 
`` So much the worse , I do n't care . 
You have a melancholy air , I want you to be pleased . 
Only promise me that you will smile . 
I want to see you smile and hear you say : ` Ah , well , that 's good . ' 
Poor Mr. Marius ! 
you know ? 
You promised me that you would give me anything I like -- '' `` Yes ! 
Only speak ! '' 
She looked Marius full in the eye , and said : -- `` I have the address . '' 
Marius turned pale . 
All the blood flowed back to his heart . 
`` What address ? '' 
`` The address that you asked me to get ! '' 
She added , as though with an effort : -- `` The address -- you know very well ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
stammered Marius . 
`` Of that young lady . '' 
This word uttered , she sighed deeply . 
Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly . 
`` Oh ! 
Well ! 
lead me thither ! 
Tell me ! 
Ask of me anything you wish ! 
Where is it ? '' 
`` Come with me , '' she responded . 
`` I do n't know the street or number very well ; it is in quite the other direction from here , but I know the house well , I will take you to it . '' 
She withdrew her hand and went on , in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer , but which did not even graze Marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state : -- `` Oh ! 
how glad you are ! '' 
A cloud swept across Marius ' brow . 
He seized Eponine by the arm : -- `` Swear one thing to me ! '' 
`` Swear ! '' 
said she , `` what does that mean ? 
Come ! 
You want me to swear ? '' 
And she laughed . 
`` Your father ! 
promise me , Eponine ! 
Swear to me that you will not give this address to your father ! '' 
She turned to him with a stupefied air . 
`` Eponine ! 
How do you know that my name is Eponine ? '' 
`` Promise what I tell you ! '' 
But she did not seem to hear him . 
`` That 's nice ! 
You have called me Eponine ! '' 
Marius grasped both her arms at once . 
`` But answer me , in the name of Heaven ! 
pay attention to what I am saying to you , swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know ! '' 
`` My father ! '' 
said she . 
`` Ah yes , my father ! 
Be at ease . 
He 's in close confinement . 
Besides , what do I care for my father ! '' 
`` But you do not promise me ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
`` Let go of me ! '' 
she said , bursting into a laugh , `` how you do shake me ! 
Yes ! 
Yes ! 
I promise that ! 
I swear that to you ! 
What is that to me ? 
I will not tell my father the address . 
There ! 
Is that right ? 
Is that it ? '' 
`` Nor to any one ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` Nor to any one . '' 
`` Now , '' resumed Marius , `` take me there . '' 
`` Immediately ? '' 
`` Immediately . '' 
`` Come along . 
Ah ! 
how pleased he is ! '' 
said she . 
After a few steps she halted . 
`` You are following me too closely , Monsieur Marius . 
Let me go on ahead , and follow me so , without seeming to do it . 
A nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me . '' 
No tongue can express all that lay in that word , woman , thus pronounced by that child . 
She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more ; Marius joined her . 
She addressed him sideways , and without turning towards him : -- `` By the way , you know that you promised me something ? '' 
Marius fumbled in his pocket . 
All that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for Thenardier the father . 
He took them and laid them in Eponine 's hand . 
She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground , and gazed at him with a gloomy air .
