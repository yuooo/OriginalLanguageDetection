`` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin . 
The coffin gave back a hollow sound . 
Fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself . 
He shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle : -- `` Comrade ! 
Before the Bon Coing is shut ! '' 
The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel . 
Fauchelevent continued . 
`` I will pay . '' 
And he seized the man 's arm . 
`` Listen to me , comrade . 
I am the convent grave-digger , I have come to help you . 
It is a business which can be performed at night . 
Let us begin , then , by going for a drink . '' 
And as he spoke , and clung to this desperate insistence , this melancholy reflection occurred to him : `` And if he drinks , will he get drunk ? '' 
`` Provincial , '' said the man , `` if you positively insist upon it , I consent . 
We will drink . 
After work , never before . '' 
And he flourished his shovel briskly . 
Fauchelevent held him back . 
`` It is Argenteuil wine , at six . '' 
`` Oh , come , '' said the grave-digger , `` you are a bell-ringer . 
Ding dong , ding dong , that 's all you know how to say . 
Go hang yourself . '' 
And he threw in a second shovelful . 
Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying . 
`` Come along and drink , '' he cried , `` since it is I who pays the bill . '' 
`` When we have put the child to bed , '' said the grave-digger . 
He flung in a third shovelful . 
Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added : -- `` It 's cold to-night , you see , and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet . '' 
At that moment , as he loaded his shovel , the grave-digger bent over , and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped . 
Fauchelevent 's wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket , and there it stopped . 
The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon ; there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket . 
The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain , traversed Fauchelevent 's pupils . 
An idea had just occurred to him . 
He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind , without the grave-digger , who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth , observing it , and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it . 
The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave . 
Just as he turned round to get the fifth , Fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said : -- `` By the way , you new man , have you your card ? '' 
The grave-digger paused . 
`` What card ? '' 
`` The sun is on the point of setting . '' 
`` That 's good , it is going to put on its nightcap . '' 
`` The gate of the cemetery will close immediately . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Have you your card ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my card ? '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he fumbled in his pocket . 
Having searched one pocket , he proceeded to search the other . 
He passed on to his fobs , explored the first , returned to the second . 
`` Why , no , '' said he , `` I have not my card . 
I must have forgotten it . '' 
`` Fifteen francs fine , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger turned green . 
Green is the pallor of livid people . 
`` Ah ! 
Jesus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-a-bas-la-lune ! '' 
-LSB- 17 -RSB- he exclaimed . 
`` Fifteen francs fine ! '' 
-LSB- 17 -RSB- Jesus-my-God-bandy-leg -- down with the moon ! 
`` Three pieces of a hundred sous , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger dropped his shovel . 
Fauchelevent 's turn had come . 
`` Ah , come now , conscript , '' said Fauchelevent , `` none of this despair . 
There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave . 
Fifteen francs is fifteen francs , and besides , you may not be able to pay it . 
I am an old hand , you are a new one . 
I know all the ropes and the devices . 
I will give you some friendly advice . 
One thing is clear , the sun is on the point of setting , it is touching the dome now , the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more . '' 
`` That is true , '' replied the man . 
`` Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave , it is as hollow as the devil , this grave , and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut . '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` In that case , a fine of fifteen francs . '' 
`` Fifteen francs . '' 
`` But you have time . 
Where do you live ? '' 
`` A couple of steps from the barrier , a quarter of an hour from here . 
No. 87 Rue de Vaugirard . '' 
`` You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed . '' 
`` That is exactly so . '' 
`` Once outside the gate , you gallop home , you get your card , you return , the cemetery porter admits you . 
As you have your card , there will be nothing to pay . 
And you will bury your corpse . 
I 'll watch it for you in the meantime , so that it shall not run away . '' 
`` I am indebted to you for my life , peasant . '' 
`` Decamp ! '' 
said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger , overwhelmed with gratitude , shook his hand and set off on a run . 
When the man had disappeared in the thicket , Fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance , then he leaned over the grave , and said in a low tone : -- `` Father Madeleine ! '' 
There was no reply . 
Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder . 
He tumbled rather than climbed into the grave , flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried : -- `` Are you there ? '' 
Silence in the coffin . 
Fauchelevent , hardly able to draw his breath for trembling , seized his cold chisel and his hammer , and pried up the coffin lid . 
Jean Valjean 's face appeared in the twilight ; it was pale and his eyes were closed . 
Fauchelevent 's hair rose upright on his head , he sprang to his feet , then fell back against the side of the grave , ready to swoon on the coffin . 
He stared at Jean Valjean .
