Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper , and who had not the air of being frightfully poor , would have been equivalent to an order . 
But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire , and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will , was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate . 
She retorted with acrimony : -- `` She must work , since she eats . 
I do n't feed her to do nothing . '' 
`` What is she making ? '' 
went on the stranger , in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter 's shoulders . 
The Thenardier deigned to reply : -- `` Stockings , if you please . 
Stockings for my little girls , who have none , so to speak , and who are absolutely barefoot just now . '' 
The man looked at Cosette 's poor little red feet , and continued : -- `` When will she have finished this pair of stockings ? '' 
`` She has at least three or four good days ' work on them still , the lazy creature ! '' 
`` And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them ? '' 
The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him . 
`` Thirty sous at least . '' 
`` Will you sell them for five francs ? '' 
went on the man . 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
exclaimed a carter who was listening , with a loud laugh ; `` five francs ! 
the deuce , I should think so ! 
five balls ! '' 
Thenardier thought it time to strike in . 
`` Yes , sir ; if such is your fancy , you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs . 
We can refuse nothing to travellers . '' 
`` You must pay on the spot , '' said the Thenardier , in her curt and peremptory fashion . 
`` I will buy that pair of stockings , '' replied the man , `` and , '' he added , drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket , and laying it on the table , `` I will pay for them . '' 
Then he turned to Cosette . 
`` Now I own your work ; play , my child . '' 
The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece , that he abandoned his glass and hastened up . 
`` But it 's true ! '' 
he cried , examining it . 
`` A real hind wheel ! 
and not counterfeit ! '' 
Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket . 
The Thenardier had no reply to make . 
She bit her lips , and her face assumed an expression of hatred . 
In the meantime , Cosette was trembling . 
She ventured to ask : -- `` Is it true , Madame ? 
May I play ? '' 
`` Play ! '' 
said the Thenardier , in a terrible voice . 
`` Thanks , Madame , '' said Cosette . 
And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier , her whole little soul thanked the traveller . 
Thenardier had resumed his drinking ; his wife whispered in his ear : -- `` Who can this yellow man be ? '' 
`` I have seen millionaires with coats like that , '' replied Thenardier , in a sovereign manner . 
Cosette had dropped her knitting , but had not left her seat . 
Cosette always moved as little as possible . 
She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her . 
Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on . 
They had just executed a very important operation ; they had just got hold of the cat . 
They had thrown their doll on the ground , and Eponine , who was the elder , was swathing the little cat , in spite of its mewing and its contortions , in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps . 
While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children , whose grace , like the splendor of the butterfly 's wing , vanishes when one essays to fix it fast . 
`` You see , sister , this doll is more amusing than the other . 
She twists , she cries , she is warm . 
See , sister , let us play with her . 
She shall be my little girl . 
I will be a lady . 
I will come to see you , and you shall look at her . 
Gradually , you will perceive her whiskers , and that will surprise you . 
And then you will see her ears , and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you . 
And you will say to me , ` Ah ! 
Mon Dieu ! ' 
and I will say to you : ` Yes , Madame , it is my little girl . 
Little girls are made like that just at present . ' '' 
Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine . 
In the meantime , the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song , and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook . 
Thenardier accompanied and encouraged them . 
As birds make nests out of everything , so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand . 
While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat , Cosette , on her side , had dressed up her sword . 
That done , she laid it in her arms , and sang to it softly , to lull it to sleep . 
The doll is one of the most imperious needs and , at the same time , one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood . 
To care for , to clothe , to deck , to dress , to undress , to redress , to teach , scold a little , to rock , to dandle , to lull to sleep , to imagine that something is some one , -- therein lies the whole woman 's future . 
While dreaming and chattering , making tiny outfits , and baby clothes , while sewing little gowns , and corsages and bodices , the child grows into a young girl , the young girl into a big girl , the big girl into a woman . 
The first child is the continuation of the last doll . 
A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy , and quite as impossible , as a woman without children . 
So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword . 
Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man ; `` My husband is right , '' she thought ; `` perhaps it is M. Laffitte ; there are such queer rich men ! '' 
She came and set her elbows on the table . 
`` Monsieur , '' said she . 
At this word , Monsieur , the man turned ; up to that time , the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme . 
`` You see , sir , '' she pursued , assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien , `` I am willing that the child should play ; I do not oppose it , but it is good for once , because you are generous . 
You see , she has nothing ; she must needs work . '' 
`` Then this child is not yours ? '' 
demanded the man . 
`` Oh ! 
mon Dieu ! 
no , sir ! 
she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity ; a sort of imbecile child . 
She must have water on the brain ; she has a large head , as you see . 
We do what we can for her , for we are not rich ; we have written in vain to her native place , and have received no reply these six months . 
It must be that her mother is dead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the man , and fell into his revery once more . 
`` Her mother did n't amount to much , '' added the Thenardier ; `` she abandoned her child . '' 
During the whole of this conversation Cosette , as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion , had not taken her eyes from the Thenardier 's face ; she listened vaguely ; she caught a few words here and there . 
Meanwhile , the drinkers , all three-quarters intoxicated , were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety ; it was a highly spiced and wanton song , in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced . 
The Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter . 
Cosette , from her post under the table , gazed at the fire , which was reflected from her fixed eyes . 
She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made , and , as she rocked it , she sang in a low voice , `` My mother is dead ! 
my mother is dead ! 
my mother is dead ! '' 
On being urged afresh by the hostess , the yellow man , `` the millionaire , '' consented at last to take supper .
