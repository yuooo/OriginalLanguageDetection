Dieu-Jesus ! 
Did you fall from heaven ? 
There is no trouble about that : if ever you do fall , it will be from there . 
And what a state you are in ! 
You have no cravat ; you have no hat ; you have no coat ! 
Do you know , you would have frightened any one who did not know you ? 
No coat ! 
Lord God ! 
Are the saints going mad nowadays ? 
But how did you get in here ? '' 
His words tumbled over each other . 
The goodman talked with a rustic volubility , in which there was nothing alarming . 
All this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness . 
`` Who are you ? 
and what house is this ? '' 
demanded Jean Valjean . 
`` Ah ! 
pardieu , this is too much ! '' 
exclaimed the old man . 
`` I am the person for whom you got the place here , and this house is the one where you had me placed . 
What ! 
You do n't recognize me ? '' 
`` No , '' said Jean Valjean ; `` and how happens it that you know me ? '' 
`` You saved my life , '' said the man . 
He turned . 
A ray of moonlight outlined his profile , and Jean Valjean recognized old Fauchelevent . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Jean Valjean , `` so it is you ? 
Yes , I recollect you . '' 
`` That is very lucky , '' said the old man , in a reproachful tone . 
`` And what are you doing here ? '' 
resumed Jean Valjean . 
`` Why , I am covering my melons , of course ! '' 
In fact , at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him , old Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed . 
During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them . 
It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean . 
He continued : -- `` I said to myself , ` The moon is bright : it is going to freeze . 
What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats ? ' 
And , '' he added , looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile , -- `` pardieu ! 
you ought to have done the same ! 
But how do you come here ? '' 
Jean Valjean , finding himself known to this man , at least only under the name of Madeleine , thenceforth advanced only with caution . 
He multiplied his questions . 
Strange to say , their roles seemed to be reversed . 
It was he , the intruder , who interrogated . 
`` And what is this bell which you wear on your knee ? '' 
`` This , '' replied Fauchelevent , `` is so that I may be avoided . '' 
`` What ! 
so that you may be avoided ? '' 
Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air . 
`` Ah , goodness ! 
there are only women in this house -- many young girls . 
It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet . 
The bell gives them warning . 
When I come , they go . 
`` What house is this ? '' 
`` Come , you know well enough . '' 
`` But I do not . '' 
`` Not when you got me the place here as gardener ? '' 
`` Answer me as though I knew nothing . '' 
`` Well , then , this is the Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
Memories recurred to Jean Valjean . 
Chance , that is to say , Providence , had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old Fauchelevent , crippled by the fall from his cart , had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously . 
He repeated , as though talking to himself : -- `` The Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
`` Exactly , '' returned old Fauchelevent . 
`` But to come to the point , how the deuce did you manage to get in here , you , Father Madeleine ? 
No matter if you are a saint ; you are a man as well , and no man enters here . '' 
`` You certainly are here . '' 
`` There is no one but me . '' 
`` Still , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I must stay here . '' 
`` Ah , good God ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
Jean Valjean drew near to the old man , and said to him in a grave voice : -- `` Father Fauchelevent , I saved your life . '' 
`` I was the first to recall it , '' returned Fauchelevent . 
`` Well , you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden days . '' 
Fauchelevent took in his aged , trembling , and wrinkled hands Jean Valjean 's two robust hands , and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking . 
At length he exclaimed : -- `` Oh ! 
that would be a blessing from the good God , if I could make you some little return for that ! 
Save your life ! 
Monsieur le Maire , dispose of the old man ! '' 
A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man . 
His countenance seemed to emit a ray of light . 
`` What do you wish me to do ? '' 
he resumed . 
`` That I will explain to you . 
You have a chamber ? '' 
`` I have an isolated hovel yonder , behind the ruins of the old convent , in a corner which no one ever looks into . 
There are three rooms in it . '' 
The hut was , in fact , so well hidden behind the ruins , and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen , that Jean Valjean had not perceived it . 
`` Good , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Now I am going to ask two things of you . '' 
`` What are they , Mr. Mayor ? '' 
`` In the first place , you are not to tell any one what you know about me . 
In the second , you are not to try to find out anything more . '' 
`` As you please . 
I know that you can do nothing that is not honest , that you have always been a man after the good God 's heart . 
And then , moreover , you it was who placed me here . 
That concerns you . 
I am at your service . '' 
`` That is settled then .
