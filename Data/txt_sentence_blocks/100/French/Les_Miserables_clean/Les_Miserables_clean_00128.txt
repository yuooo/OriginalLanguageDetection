`` But she will hear . '' 
`` She will not listen . 
Besides , what the cloister knows the world learns not . '' 
A pause ensued . 
The prioress went on : -- `` You will remove your bell . 
It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit ? '' 
`` He will pay it at four o'clock to-day . 
The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung . 
But you do not understand any of the peals ? '' 
`` I pay no attention to any but my own . '' 
`` That is well , Father Fauvent . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , a lever at least six feet long will be required . '' 
`` Where will you obtain it ? '' 
`` Where gratings are not lacking , iron bars are not lacking . 
I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden . '' 
`` About three-quarters of an hour before midnight ; do not forget . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort , my brother is the strong man for you . 
A perfect Turk ! '' 
`` You will do it as speedily as possible . '' 
`` I can not work very fast . 
I am infirm ; that is why I require an assistant . 
I limp . '' 
`` To limp is no sin , and perhaps it is a blessing . 
The Emperor Henry II. , who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII. , has two surnames , the Saint and the Lame . '' 
`` Two surtouts are a good thing , '' murmured Fauchelevent , who really was a little hard of hearing . 
`` Now that I think of it , Father Fauvent , let us give a whole hour to it . 
That is not too much . 
Be near the principal altar , with your iron bar , at eleven o'clock . 
The office begins at midnight . 
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that . '' 
`` I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community . 
These are my orders . 
I am to nail up the coffin . 
At eleven o'clock exactly , I am to be in the chapel . 
The Mother Precentors will be there . 
Mother Ascension will be there . 
Two men would be better . 
However , never mind ! 
I shall have my lever . 
We will open the vault , we will lower the coffin , and we will close the vault again . 
After which , there will be no trace of anything . 
The government will have no suspicion . 
Thus all has been arranged , reverend Mother ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` What else remains ? '' 
`` The empty coffin remains . '' 
This produced a pause . 
Fauchelevent meditated . 
The prioress meditated . 
`` What is to be done with that coffin , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` It will be given to the earth . '' 
`` Empty ? '' 
Another silence . 
Fauchelevent made , with his left hand , that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject . 
`` Reverend Mother , I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church , and no one can enter there but myself , and I will cover the coffin with the pall . '' 
`` Yes , but the bearers , when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave , will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the de -- ! '' 
exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
The prioress began to make the sign of the cross , and looked fixedly at the gardener . 
The vil stuck fast in his throat . 
He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath . 
`` I will put earth in the coffin , reverend Mother . 
That will produce the effect of a corpse . '' 
`` You are right . 
Earth , that is the same thing as man . 
So you will manage the empty coffin ? '' 
`` I will make that my special business . '' 
The prioress 's face , up to that moment troubled and clouded , grew serene once more . 
She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him . 
Fauchelevent went towards the door . 
As he was on the point of passing out , the prioress raised her voice gently : -- `` I am pleased with you , Father Fauvent ; bring your brother to me to-morrow , after the burial , and tell him to fetch his daughter . '' 
IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ AUSTIN CASTILLEJO The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man ; they do not reach their goal very promptly . 
Moreover , Fauchelevent was in a dilemma . 
He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden . 
Cosette had waked up . 
Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire . 
At the moment when Fauchelevent entered , Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner 's basket on the wall , and saying to her , `` Listen attentively to me , my little Cosette . 
We must go away from this house , but we shall return to it , and we shall be very happy here . 
The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that . 
You will wait for me at a lady 's house . 
I shall come to fetch you . 
Obey , and say nothing , above all things , unless you want Madame Thenardier to get you again ! '' 
Cosette nodded gravely . 
Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the door . 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Everything is arranged , and nothing is , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` I have permission to bring you in ; but before bringing you in you must be got out . 
That 's where the difficulty lies . 
It is easy enough with the child . '' 
`` You will carry her out ? '' 
`` And she will hold her tongue ? '' 
`` I answer for that . '' 
`` But you , Father Madeleine ? '' 
And , after a silence , fraught with anxiety , Fauchelevent exclaimed : -- `` Why , get out as you came in ! ''
