Jean Valjean , as in the first instance , contented himself with saying , `` Impossible . '' 
Fauchelevent grumbled , more to himself than to Jean Valjean : -- `` There is another thing which bothers me . 
I have said that I would put earth in it . 
When I come to think it over , the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing , it wo n't do , it will get displaced , it will move about . 
The men will bear it . 
You understand , Father Madeleine , the government will notice it . '' 
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving . 
Fauchelevent went on : -- `` How the de -- uce are you going to get out ? 
It must all be done by to-morrow morning . 
It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in . 
The prioress expects you . '' 
Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he , Fauchelevent , was to render to the community . 
That it fell among his duties to take part in their burials , that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery . 
That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed , and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel . 
That the police regulations forbade this , but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused . 
That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased . 
That it was so much the worse for the government . 
That he , Fauchelevent , was to nail up the coffin in the cell , raise the stone in the chapel , and lower the corpse into the vault . 
And that , by way of thanks , the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener , and his niece as a pupil . 
That his brother was M. Madeleine , and that his niece was Cosette . 
That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening , after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery . 
But that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside . 
That that was the first problem . 
And then , that there was another : the empty coffin . '' 
`` What is that empty coffin ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` The coffin of the administration . '' 
`` What coffin ? 
What administration ? '' 
`` A nun dies . 
The municipal doctor comes and says , ` A nun has died . ' 
The government sends a coffin . 
The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker 's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery . 
The undertaker 's men will come and lift the coffin ; there will be nothing in it . '' 
`` Put something in it . '' 
`` A corpse ? 
I have none . '' 
`` No . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` A living person . '' 
`` What person ? '' 
`` Me ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent , who was seated , sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair . 
`` You ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter . 
`` You know , Fauchelevent , what you have said : ` Mother Crucifixion is dead . ' 
and I add : ` and Father Madeleine is buried . ' 
`` Ah ! 
good , you can laugh , you are not speaking seriously . '' 
`` Very seriously , I must get out of this place . '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` l have told you to find a basket , and a cover for me also , '' `` Well ? '' 
`` The basket will be of pine , and the cover a black cloth . '' 
`` In the first place , it will be a white cloth . 
Nuns are buried in white . '' 
`` Let it be a white cloth , then . '' 
`` You are not like other men , Father Madeleine . '' 
To behold such devices , which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys , spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him , and mingle with what he called the `` petty course of life in the convent , '' caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by . 
Jean Valjean went on : -- `` The problem is to get out of here without being seen . 
This offers the means . 
But give me some information , in the first place . 
How is it managed ? 
Where is this coffin ? '' 
`` The empty one ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Down stairs , in what is called the dead-room . 
It stands on two trestles , under the pall . '' 
`` How long is the coffin ? '' 
`` Six feet . '' 
`` What is this dead-room ? '' 
`` It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden , which is closed on the outside by a shutter , and two doors ; one leads into the convent , the other into the church . '' 
`` What church ? '' 
`` The church in the street , the church which any one can enter . '' 
`` Have you the keys to those two doors ? '' 
`` No ; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent ; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church . '' 
`` When does the porter open that door ? '' 
`` Only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter , when they come to get the coffin . 
When the coffin has been taken out , the door is closed again . '' 
`` Who nails up the coffin ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Who spreads the pall over it ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Are you alone ? '' 
`` Not another man , except the police doctor , can enter the dead-room . 
That is even written on the wall . '' 
`` Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep ? '' 
`` No . 
But I could hide you in a small , dark nook which opens on the dead-room , where I keep my tools to use for burials , and of which I have the key . '' 
`` At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow ? '' 
`` About three o'clock in the afternoon . 
The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall . 
It is not very near . '' 
`` I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the morning . 
And how about food ? 
I shall be hungry . '' 
`` I will bring you something . '' 
`` You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock . '' 
Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints .
