When these men were re-united , one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence , and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood . 
They halted directly under Thenardier . 
These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant . 
It must be added , that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box . 
Thenardier , not being able to distinguish their visages , lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost . 
Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes , -- these men conversed in slang . 
The first said in a low but distinct voice : -- `` Let 's cut . 
What are we up to here ? '' 
The second replied : `` It 's raining hard enough to put out the very devil 's fire . 
And the bobbies will be along instanter . 
There 's a soldier on guard yonder . 
We shall get nabbed here . '' 
These two words , icigo and icicaille , both of which mean ici , and which belong , the first to the slang of the barriers , the second to the slang of the Temple , were flashes of light for Thenardier . 
By the icigo he recognized Brujon , who was a prowler of the barriers , by the icicaille he knew Babet , who , among his other trades , had been an old-clothes broker at the Temple . 
The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the Temple , and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity . 
Had it not been for the icicaille , Thenardier would not have recognized him , for he had entirely changed his voice . 
In the meanwhile , the third man had intervened . 
`` There 's no hurry yet , let 's wait a bit . 
How do we know that he does n't stand in need of us ? '' 
By this , which was nothing but French , Thenardier recognized Montparnasse , who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speak none of them . 
As for the fourth , he held his peace , but his huge shoulders betrayed him . 
Thenardier did not hesitate . 
It was Guelemer . 
Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone : -- `` What are you jabbering about ? 
The tavern-keeper has n't managed to cut his stick . 
He do n't tumble to the racket , that he do n't ! 
You have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt , cut up your sheet to make a rope , punch holes in doors , get up false papers , make false keys , file your irons , hang out your cord , hide yourself , and disguise yourself ! 
The old fellow has n't managed to play it , he does n't understand how to work the business . '' 
Babet added , still in that classical slang which was spoken by Poulailler and Cartouche , and which is to the bold , new , highly colored and risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the language of Andre Chenier : -- `` Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act . 
You have to be knowing . 
He 's only a greenhorn . 
He must have let himself be taken in by a bobby , perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal . 
Listen , Montparnasse , do you hear those shouts in the prison ? 
You have seen all those lights . 
He 's recaptured , there ! 
He 'll get off with twenty years . 
I ai n't afraid , I ai n't a coward , but there ai n't anything more to do , or otherwise they 'd lead us a dance . 
Do n't get mad , come with us , let 's go drink a bottle of old wine together . '' 
`` One does n't desert one 's friends in a scrape , '' grumbled Montparnasse . 
`` I tell you he 's nabbed ! '' 
retorted Brujon . 
`` At the present moment , the inn-keeper ai n't worth a ha ` penny . 
We ca n't do nothing for him . 
Let 's be off . 
Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist . '' 
Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance ; the fact is , that these four men , with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other , had prowled all night long about La Force , great as was their peril , in the hope of seeing Thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall . 
But the night , which was really growing too fine , -- for the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted , -- the cold which was overpowering them , their soaked garments , their hole-ridden shoes , the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison , the hours which had elapsed , the patrol which they had encountered , the hope which was vanishing , all urged them to beat a retreat . 
Montparnasse himself , who was , perhaps , almost Thenardier 's son-in-law , yielded . 
A moment more , and they would be gone . 
Thenardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the Meduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon . 
He dared not call to them ; a cry might be heard and ruin everything . 
An idea occurred to him , a last idea , a flash of inspiration ; he drew from his pocket the end of Brujon 's rope , which he had detached from the chimney of the New Building , and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence . 
This rope fell at their feet . 
`` A widow , '' -LSB- 37 -RSB- said Babet . 
-LSB- 37 -RSB- Argot of the Temple . 
`` My tortouse ! '' 
-LSB- 38 -RSB- said Brujon . 
-LSB- 38 -RSB- Argot of the barriers . 
`` The tavern-keeper is there , '' said Montparnasse . 
They raised their eyes . 
Thenardier thrust out his head a very little . 
`` Quick ! '' 
said Montparnasse , `` have you the other end of the rope , Brujon ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Knot the two pieces together , we 'll fling him the rope , he can fasten it to the wall , and he 'll have enough of it to get down with . '' 
Thenardier ran the risk , and spoke : -- `` I am paralyzed with cold . '' 
`` We 'll warm you up . '' 
`` I ca n't budge . '' 
`` Let yourself slide , we 'll catch you . '' 
`` My hands are benumbed . '' 
`` Only fasten the rope to the wall . '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
`` Then one of us must climb up , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` Three stories ! '' 
ejaculated Brujon . 
An ancient plaster flue , which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times , ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see Thenardier . 
This flue , then much damaged and full of cracks , has since fallen , but the marks of it are still visible . 
It was very narrow . 
`` One might get up by the help of that , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` By that flue ? '' 
exclaimed Babet , `` a grown-up cove , never ! 
it would take a brat . '' 
`` A brat must be got , '' resumed Brujon . 
`` Where are we to find a young ` un ? '' 
said Guelemer . 
`` Wait , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` I 've got the very article . '' 
He opened the gate of the fence very softly , made sure that no one was passing along the street , stepped out cautiously , shut the gate behind him , and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille . 
Seven or eight minutes elapsed , eight thousand centuries to Thenardier ; Babet , Brujon , and Guelemer did not open their lips ; at last the gate opened once more , and Montparnasse appeared , breathless , and followed by Gavroche . 
The rain still rendered the street completely deserted . 
Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air . 
The water was dripping from his hair . 
Guelemer addressed him : -- `` Are you a man , young ` un ? '' 
Gavroche shrugged his shoulders , and replied : -- `` A young ` un like me 's a man , and men like you are babes . '' 
`` The brat 's tongue 's well hung ! '' 
exclaimed Babet . 
`` The Paris brat ai n't made of straw , '' added Brujon . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
asked Gavroche . 
Montparnasse answered : -- `` Climb up that flue . ''
