Come now ! 
we must have a snooze all the same . '' 
However , he asked them no questions . 
What was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place ! 
The elder of the two children , who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood , uttered this exclamation : -- `` It 's queer , all the same . 
Mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on Palm Sunday . '' 
`` Bosh , '' said Gavroche . 
`` Mamma , '' resumed the elder , `` is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss. '' `` Tanflute ! '' 
retorted Gavroche . 
Meanwhile he had halted , and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained . 
At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied , but which was triumphant , in reality . 
`` Let us be calm , young ` uns . 
Here 's supper for three . '' 
And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou . 
Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement , he pushed both of them before him into the baker 's shop , and flung his sou on the counter , crying : -- `` Boy ! 
five centimes ' worth of bread . '' 
The baker , who was the proprietor in person , took up a loaf and a knife . 
`` In three pieces , my boy ! '' 
went on Gavroche . 
And he added with dignity : -- `` There are three of us . '' 
And seeing that the baker , after scrutinizing the three customers , had taken down a black loaf , he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great Frederick 's snuff on the tip of his thumb , and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker 's face : -- `` Keksekca ? '' 
Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation of Gavroche 's to the baker a Russian or a Polish word , or one of those savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river , athwart the solitudes , are warned that it is a word which they -LSB- our readers -RSB- utter every day , and which takes the place of the phrase : `` Qu'est - ce que c'est que cela ? '' 
The baker understood perfectly , and replied : -- `` Well ! 
It 's bread , and very good bread of the second quality . '' 
`` You mean larton brutal -LSB- black bread -RSB- ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , calmly and coldly disdainful . 
`` White bread , boy ! 
white bread -LSB- larton savonne -RSB- ! 
I 'm standing treat . '' 
The baker could not repress a smile , and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche . 
`` Come , now , baker 's boy ! '' 
said he , `` what are you taking our measure like that for ? '' 
All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure . 
When the bread was cut , the baker threw the sou into his drawer , and Gavroche said to the two children : -- `` Grub away . '' 
The little boys stared at him in surprise . 
Gavroche began to laugh . 
`` Ah ! 
hullo , that 's so ! 
they do n't understand yet , they 're too small . '' 
And he repeated : -- `` Eat away . '' 
At the same time , he held out a piece of bread to each of them . 
And thinking that the elder , who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation , deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite , he added , as be handed him the largest share : -- `` Ram that into your muzzle . '' 
One piece was smaller than the others ; he kept this for himself . 
The poor children , including Gavroche , were famished . 
As they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls , they blocked up the shop of the baker , who , now that they had paid their money , looked angrily at them . 
`` Let 's go into the street again , '' said Gavroche . 
They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille . 
From time to time , as they passed the lighted shop-windows , the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord . 
`` Well , he is a very green ` un , '' said Gavroche . 
Then , becoming thoughtful , he muttered between his teeth : -- `` All the same , if I had charge of the babes I 'd lock 'em up better than that . '' 
Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread , and had reached the angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets , at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of La Force was visible : -- `` Hullo , is that you , Gavroche ? '' 
said some one . 
`` Hullo , is that you , Montparnasse ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
A man had just accosted the street urchin , and the man was no other than Montparnasse in disguise , with blue spectacles , but recognizable to Gavroche . 
`` The bow-wows ! '' 
went on Gavroche , `` you 've got a hide the color of a linseed plaster , and blue specs like a doctor . 
You 're putting on style , ` pon my word ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
ejaculated Montparnasse , `` not so loud . '' 
And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops . 
The two little ones followed mechanically , holding each other by the hand . 
When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere , sheltered from the rain and from all eyes : -- `` Do you know where I 'm going ? '' 
demanded Montparnasse . 
`` To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret , '' -LSB- 36 -RSB- replied Gavroche . 
-LSB- 36 -RSB- The scaffold . 
`` Joker ! '' 
And Montparnasse went on : -- `` I 'm going to find Babet . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche , `` so her name is Babet . '' 
Montparnasse lowered his voice : -- `` Not she , he . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Babet . '' 
`` Yes , Babet . '' 
`` I thought he was buckled . '' 
`` He has undone the buckle , '' replied Montparnasse . 
And he rapidly related to the gamin how , on the morning of that very day , Babet , having been transferred to La Conciergerie , had made his escape , by turning to the left instead of to the right in `` the police office . '' 
Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill . 
`` What a dentist ! '' 
he cried . 
Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet 's flight , and ended with : -- `` Oh ! 
That 's not all . '' 
Gavroche , as he listened , had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in his hand , and mechanically pulled at the upper part , and the blade of a dagger made its appearance . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he exclaimed , pushing the dagger back in haste , `` you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois . '' 
Montparnasse winked . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
resumed Gavroche , `` so you 're going to have a bout with the bobbies ? '' 
`` You ca n't tell , '' replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air . 
`` It 's always a good thing to have a pin about one . '' 
Gavroche persisted : -- `` What are you up to to-night ? '' 
Again Montparnasse took a grave tone , and said , mouthing every syllable : `` Things . '' 
And abruptly changing the conversation : -- `` By the way ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Something happened t ` other day . 
Fancy . 
I meet a bourgeois . 
He makes me a present of a sermon and his purse . 
I put it in my pocket . 
A minute later , I feel in my pocket .
