Here is none of your heavy-sides , a student who studies , a greenhorn pedant , strong on letters , theology , science , and sapience , one of those dull wits cut by the square ; a pin by profession . 
He is an honorable idler who lounges , who practises country jaunts , who cultivates the grisette , who pays court to the fair sex , who is at this very moment , perhaps , with my mistress . 
Let us save him . 
Death to Blondeau ! ' 
At that moment , Blondeau dipped his pen in , all black with erasures in the ink , cast his yellow eyes round the audience room , and repeated for the third time : ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
I replied : ` Present ! ' 
This is why you were not crossed off . '' 
`` Monsieur ! 
-- '' said Marius . 
`` And why I was , '' added Laigle de Meaux . 
`` I do not understand you , '' said Marius . 
Laigle resumed : -- `` Nothing is more simple . 
I was close to the desk to reply , and close to the door for the purpose of flight . 
The professor gazed at me with a certain intensity . 
All of a sudden , Blondeau , who must be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau , skipped to the letter L. L is my letter . 
I am from Meaux , and my name is Lesgle . '' 
`` L'Aigle ! '' 
interrupted Marius , `` what fine name ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Blondeau came to this fine name , and called : ` Laigle ! ' 
I reply : ` Present ! ' 
Then Blondeau gazes at me , with the gentleness of a tiger , and says to me : ` lf you are Pontmercy , you are not Laigle . ' 
A phrase which has a disobliging air for you , but which was lugubrious only for me . 
That said , he crossed me off . '' 
Marius exclaimed : -- `` I am mortified , sir -- '' `` First of all , '' interposed Laigle , `` I demand permission to embalm Blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium . 
I will assume that he is dead . 
There will be no great change required in his gauntness , in his pallor , in his coldness , and in his smell . 
And I say : ` Erudimini qui judicatis terram . 
Here lies Blondeau , Blondeau the Nose , Blondeau Nasica , the ox of discipline , bos disciplinae , the bloodhound of the password , the angel of the roll-call , who was upright , square exact , rigid , honest , and hideous . 
God crossed him off as he crossed me off . ' '' 
Marius resumed : -- `` I am very sorry -- '' `` Young man , '' said Laigle de Meaux , `` let this serve you as a lesson . 
In future , be exact . '' 
`` I really beg you a thousand pardons . '' 
`` Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again . '' 
`` I am extremely sorry -- '' Laigle burst out laughing . 
`` And I am delighted . 
I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer . 
This erasure saves me . 
I renounce the triumphs of the bar . 
I shall not defend the widow , and I shall not attack the orphan . 
No more toga , no more stage . 
Here is my erasure all ready for me . 
It is to you that I am indebted for it , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you . 
Where do you live ? '' 
`` In this cab , '' said Marius . 
`` A sign of opulence , '' retorted Laigle calmly . 
`` I congratulate you . 
You have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum . '' 
At that moment , Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe . 
Marius smiled sadly . 
`` I have paid this rent for the last two hours , and I aspire to get rid of it ; but there is a sort of history attached to it , and I do n't know where to go . '' 
`` Come to my place , sir , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` I have the priority , '' observed Laigle , `` but I have no home . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Bossuet , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` Bossuet , '' said Marius , `` but I thought that your name was Laigle . '' 
`` De Meaux , '' replied Laigle ; `` by metaphor , Bossuet . '' 
Courfeyrac entered the cab . 
`` Coachman , '' said he , `` hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques . '' 
And that very evening , Marius found himself installed in a chamber of the hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac . 
MARIUS ' ASTONISHMENTS In a few days , Marius had become Courfeyrac 's friend . 
Youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars . 
Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac 's society , a decidedly new thing for him . 
Courfeyrac put no questions to him . 
He did not even think of such a thing . 
At that age , faces disclose everything on the spot . 
Words are superfluous . 
There are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter . 
One looks at them and one knows them . 
One morning , however , Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to him : -- `` By the way , have you any political opinions ? '' 
`` The idea ! '' 
said Marius , almost affronted by the question . 
`` What are you ? '' 
`` A democrat-Bonapartist . '' 
`` The gray hue of a reassured rat , '' said Courfeyrac . 
On the following day , Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Cafe Musain . 
Then he whispered in his ear , with a smile : `` I must give you your entry to the revolution . '' 
And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B C . 
He presented him to the other comrades , saying this simple word which Marius did not understand : `` A pupil . '' 
Marius had fallen into a wasps ' - nest of wits . 
However , although he was silent and grave , he was , none the less , both winged and armed . 
Marius , up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy , and to asides , both by habit and by taste , was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him . 
All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once , and pulled him about . 
The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl . 
Sometimes , in his trouble , they fled so far from him , that he had difficulty in recovering them . 
He heard them talk of philosophy , of literature , of art , of history , of religion , in unexpected fashion . 
He caught glimpses of strange aspects ; and , as he did not place them in proper perspective , he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped . 
On abandoning his grandfather 's opinions for the opinions of his father , he had supposed himself fixed ; he now suspected , with uneasiness , and without daring to avow it to himself , that he was not . 
The angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew . 
A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion . 
An odd internal upsetting . 
He almost suffered from it . 
It seemed as though there were no `` consecrated things '' for those young men . 
Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject , which embarrassed his still timid mind . 
A theatre poster presented itself , adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic : `` Down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois ! '' 
cried Bahorel . 
And Marius heard Combeferre reply : -- `` You are wrong , Bahorel . 
The bourgeoisie loves tragedy , and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score . 
Bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence , and I am not one of those who , by order of AEschylus , contest its right to existence . 
There are rough outlines in nature ; there are , in creation , ready-made parodies ; a beak which is not a beak , wings which are not wings , gills which are not gills , paws which are not paws , a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh , there is the duck . 
Now , since poultry exists by the side of the bird , I do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy . ''
