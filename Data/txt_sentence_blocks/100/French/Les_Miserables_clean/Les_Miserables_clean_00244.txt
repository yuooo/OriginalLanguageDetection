`` If we go away , do you go too ! 
I will tell you where ! 
Come and join me wherever I am . '' 
Marius was now a thoroughly roused man . 
He had fallen back into reality . 
He cried to Cosette : -- `` Go away with you ! 
Are you mad ? 
Why , I should have to have money , and I have none ! 
Go to England ? 
But I am in debt now , I owe , I do n't know how much , more than ten louis to Courfeyrac , one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted ! 
I have an old hat which is not worth three francs , I have a coat which lacks buttons in front , my shirt is all ragged , my elbows are torn , my boots let in the water ; for the last six weeks I have not thought about it , and I have not told you about it . 
You only see me at night , and you give me your love ; if you were to see me in the daytime , you would give me a sou ! 
Go to England ! 
Eh ! 
I have n't enough to pay for a passport ! '' 
He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand , erect , his brow pressed close to the bark , feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin , nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples , and there he stood motionless , on the point of falling , like the statue of despair . 
He remained a long time thus . 
One could remain for eternity in such abysses . 
At last he turned round . 
He heard behind him a faint stifled noise , which was sweet yet sad . 
It was Cosette sobbing . 
She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he meditated . 
He came to her , fell at her knees , and slowly prostrating himself , he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe , and kissed it . 
She let him have his way in silence . 
There are moments when a woman accepts , like a sombre and resigned goddess , the religion of love . 
`` Do not weep , '' he said . 
She murmured : -- `` Not when I may be going away , and you can not come ! '' 
He went on : -- `` Do you love me ? '' 
She replied , sobbing , by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid tears : -- `` I adore you ! '' 
He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress : -- `` Do not weep . 
Tell me , will you do this for me , and cease to weep ? '' 
`` Do you love me ? '' 
said she . 
He took her hand . 
`` Cosette , I have never given my word of honor to any one , because my word of honor terrifies me . 
I feel that my father is by my side . 
Well , I give you my most sacred word of honor , that if you go away I shall die . '' 
In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil , that Cosette trembled . 
She felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by . 
The shock made her cease weeping . 
`` Now , listen , '' said he , `` do not expect me to-morrow . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Why ? '' 
`` You will see . '' 
`` A day without seeing you ! 
But that is impossible ! '' 
`` Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives , perhaps . '' 
And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside : -- `` He is a man who never changes his habits , and he has never received any one except in the evening . '' 
`` Of what man are you speaking ? '' 
asked Cosette . 
`` I ? 
I said nothing . '' 
`` What do you hope , then ? '' 
`` Wait until the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` Yes , Cosette . '' 
She took his head in both her hands , raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him , and tried to read his hope in his eyes . 
Marius resumed : -- `` Now that I think of it , you ought to know my address : something might happen , one never knows ; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac , Rue de la Verrerie , No. 16 . '' 
He searched in his pocket , pulled out his penknife , and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall : -- `` 16 Rue de la Verrerie . '' 
In the meantime , Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more . 
`` Tell me your thought , Marius ; you have some idea . 
Tell it to me . 
Oh ! 
tell me , so that I may pass a pleasant night . '' 
`` This is my idea : that it is impossible that God should mean to part us . 
Wait ; expect me the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` What shall I do until then ? '' 
said Cosette . 
`` You are outside , you go , and come ! 
How happy men are ! 
I shall remain entirely alone ! 
Oh ! 
How sad I shall be ! 
What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening ? 
tell me . '' 
`` I am going to try something . '' 
`` Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here , so that you may be successful . 
I will question you no further , since you do not wish it . 
You are my master . 
I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that music from Euryanthe that you love , and that you came one evening to listen to , outside my shutters . 
But day after to-morrow you will come early . 
I shall expect you at dusk , at nine o'clock precisely , I warn you . 
Mon Dieu ! 
how sad it is that the days are so long ! 
On the stroke of nine , do you understand , I shall be in the garden . '' 
`` And I also . '' 
And without having uttered it , moved by the same thought , impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication , both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow , they fell into each other 's arms , without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes , overflowing with rapture and full of tears , gazed upon the stars . 
When Marius went forth , the street was deserted . 
This was the moment when Eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard . 
While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree , an idea had crossed his mind ; an idea , alas ! 
that he himself judged to be senseless and impossible . 
He had come to a desperate decision . 
THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH OTHER At that epoch , Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first birthday . 
He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire , No. 6 , in the old house which he owned . 
He was , as the reader will remember , one of those antique old men who await death perfectly erect , whom age bears down without bending , and whom even sorrow can not curve . 
Still , his daughter had been saying for some time : `` My father is sinking . '' 
He no longer boxed the maids ' ears ; he no longer thumped the landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in opening the door . 
The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the space of barely six months .
