Thenardier continued : -- `` Come instantly -- '' He paused : -- `` You address her as thou , do you not ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked M. Leblanc . 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
cried Thenardier , `` the little one , the Lark . '' 
M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion : -- `` I do not know what you mean . '' 
`` Go on , nevertheless , '' ejaculated Thenardier , and he continued to dictate : -- `` Come immediately , I am in absolute need of thee . 
The person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me . 
I am waiting for thee . 
Come with confidence . '' 
M. Leblanc had written the whole of this . 
Thenardier resumed : -- `` Ah ! 
erase ` come with confidence ' ; that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be , and that distrust is possible . '' 
M. Leblanc erased the three words . 
`` Now , '' pursued Thenardier , `` sign it . 
What 's your name ? '' 
The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded : -- `` For whom is this letter ? '' 
`` You know well , '' retorted Thenardier , `` for the little one I just told you so . '' 
It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question . 
He said `` the Lark , '' he said `` the little one , '' but he did not pronounce her name -- the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices . 
To mention the name was to deliver the whole `` affair '' into their hands , and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing . 
He went on : -- `` Sign . 
What is your name ? '' 
`` Urbain Fabre , '' said the prisoner . 
Thenardier , with the movement of a cat , dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc . 
He looked for the mark on it , and held it close to the candle . 
`` U. F. That 's it . 
Urbain Fabre . 
Well , sign it U. F. '' The prisoner signed . 
`` As two hands are required to fold the letter , give it to me , I will fold it . '' 
That done , Thenardier resumed : -- `` Address it , ` Mademoiselle Fabre , ' at your house . 
I know that you live a long distance from here , near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas , because you go to mass there every day , but I do n't know in what street . 
I see that you understand your situation . 
As you have not lied about your name , you will not lie about your address . 
Write it yourself . '' 
The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment , then he took the pen and wrote : -- `` Mademoiselle Fabre , at M. Urbain Fabre 's , Rue Saint-Dominique-D'Enfer , No. 17 . '' 
Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion . 
`` Wife ! '' 
he cried . 
The Thenardier woman hastened to him . 
`` Here 's the letter . 
You know what you have to do . 
There is a carriage at the door . 
Set out at once , and return ditto . '' 
And addressing the man with the meat-axe : -- `` Since you have taken off your nose-screen , accompany the mistress . 
You will get up behind the fiacre . 
You know where you left the team ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the man . 
And depositing his axe in a corner , he followed Madame Thenardier . 
As they set off , Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door , and shouted into the corridor : -- `` Above all things , do n't lose the letter ! 
remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you ! '' 
The Thenardier 's hoarse voice replied : -- `` Be easy . 
I have it in my bosom . '' 
A minute had not elapsed , when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard , which rapidly retreated and died away . 
`` Good ! '' 
growled Thenardier . 
`` They 're going at a fine pace . 
At such a gallop , the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour . '' 
He drew a chair close to the fireplace , folding his arms , and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier . 
`` My feet are cold ! '' 
said he . 
Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and the prisoner . 
These men , through the black masks or paste which covered their faces , and made of them , at fear 's pleasure , charcoal-burners , negroes , or demons , had a stupid and gloomy air , and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work , tranquilly , without either wrath or mercy , with a sort of ennui . 
They were crowded together in one corner like brutes , and remained silent . 
Thenardier warmed his feet . 
The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity . 
A sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before . 
The candle , on which a large `` stranger '' had formed , cast but a dim light in the immense hovel , the brazier had grown dull , and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling . 
No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man , who was fast asleep . 
Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle . 
The enigma was more impenetrable than ever . 
Who was this `` little one '' whom Thenardier had called the Lark ? 
Was she his `` Ursule '' ? 
The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word , `` the Lark , '' and had replied in the most natural manner in the world : `` I do not know what you mean . '' 
On the other hand , the two letters U. F. were explained ; they meant Urbain Fabre ; and Ursule was no longer named Ursule . 
This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all . 
A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post , from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene . 
There he stood , almost incapable of movement or reflection , as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters . 
He waited , in the hope of some incident , no matter of what nature , since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide . 
`` In any case , '' he said , `` if she is the Lark , I shall see her , for the Thenardier woman is to bring her hither . 
That will be the end , and then I will give my life and my blood if necessary , but I will deliver her ! 
Nothing shall stop me . '' 
Nearly half an hour passed in this manner . 
Thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections , the prisoner did not stir . 
Still , Marius fancied that at intervals , and for the last few moments , he had heard a faint , dull noise in the direction of the prisoner . 
All at once , Thenardier addressed the prisoner : `` By the way , Monsieur Fabre , I might as well say it to you at once . '' 
These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation . 
Marius strained his ears . 
`` My wife will be back shortly , do n't get impatient . 
I think that the Lark really is your daughter , and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her . 
Only , listen to me a bit . 
My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter . 
I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did , so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her . 
They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind . 
Somewhere , outside the barrier , there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses . 
Your young lady will be taken to it . 
She will alight from the fiacre . 
My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her , and my wife will come back here to tell us : ` It 's done . ' 
As for the young lady , no harm will be done to her ; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet , and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs , she will be returned to you . 
If you have me arrested , my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark , that 's all . ''
