They pinioned the ruffians . 
This throng of men , sparely lighted by the single candle , filled the den with shadows . 
`` Handcuff them all ! '' 
shouted Javert . 
`` Come on ! '' 
cried a voice which was not the voice of a man , but of which no one would ever have said : `` It is a woman 's voice . '' 
The Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window , and it was she who had just given vent to this roar . 
The policemen and agents recoiled . 
She had thrown off her shawl . 
but retained her bonnet ; her husband , who was crouching behind her , was almost hidden under the discarded shawl , and she was shielding him with her body , as she elevated the paving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock . 
`` Beware ! '' 
she shouted . 
All crowded back towards the corridor . 
A broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret . 
The Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned , and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents : -- `` The cowards ! '' 
Javert smiled , and advanced across the open space which the Thenardier was devouring with her eyes . 
`` Do n't come near me , '' she cried , `` or I 'll crush you . '' 
`` What a grenadier ! '' 
ejaculated Javert ; `` you 've got a beard like a man , mother , but I have claws like a woman . '' 
And he continued to advance . 
The Thenardier , dishevelled and terrible , set her feet far apart , threw herself backwards , and hurled the paving-stone at Javert 's head . 
Javert ducked , the stone passed over him , struck the wall behind , knocked off a huge piece of plastering , and , rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel , now luckily almost empty , rested at Javert 's feet . 
At the same moment , Javert reached the Thenardier couple . 
One of his big hands descended on the woman 's shoulder ; the other on the husband 's head . 
`` The handcuffs ! '' 
he shouted . 
The policemen trooped in in force , and in a few seconds Javert 's order had been executed . 
The Thenardier female , overwhelmed , stared at her pinioned hands , and at those of her husband , who had dropped to the floor , and exclaimed , weeping : -- `` My daughters ! '' 
`` They are in the jug , '' said Javert . 
In the meanwhile , the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door , and were shaking him : -- He awoke , stammering : -- `` Is it all over , Jondrette ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Javert . 
The six pinioned ruffians were standing , and still preserved their spectral mien ; all three besmeared with black , all three masked . 
`` Keep on your masks , '' said Javert . 
And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II . 
at a Potsdam parade , he said to the three `` chimney-builders '' : -- `` Good day , Bigrenaille ! 
good day , Brujon ! 
good day , Deuxmilliards ! '' 
Then turning to the three masked men , he said to the man with the meat-axe : -- `` Good day , Gueulemer ! '' 
And to the man with the cudgel : -- `` Good day , Babet ! '' 
And to the ventriloquist : -- `` Your health , Claquesous . '' 
At that moment , he caught sight of the ruffians ' prisoner . 
who , ever since the entrance of the police , had not uttered a word , and had held his head down . 
`` Untie the gentleman ! '' 
said Javert , `` and let no one go out ! '' 
That said , he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table , where the candle and the writing-materials still remained , drew a stamped paper from his pocket , and began to prepare his report . 
When he had written the first lines , which are formulas that never vary , he raised his eyes : -- `` Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward . '' 
The policemen glanced round them . 
`` Well , '' said Javert , `` where is he ? '' 
The prisoner of the ruffians , M. Leblanc , M. Urbain Fabre , the father of Ursule or the Lark , had disappeared . 
The door was guarded , but the window was not . 
As soon as he had found himself released from his bonds , and while Javert was drawing up his report , he had taken advantage of confusion , the crowd , the darkness , and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him , to dash out of the window . 
An agent sprang to the opening and looked out . 
He saw no one outside . 
The rope ladder was still shaking . 
`` The devil ! '' 
ejaculated Javert between his teeth , `` he must have been the most valuable of the lot . '' 
THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO On the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the Boulevard de l'Hopital , a child , who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz , was ascending the side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barriere de Fontainebleau . 
Night had fully come . 
This lad was pale , thin , clad in rags , with linen trousers in the month of February , and was singing at the top of his voice . 
At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier , a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern ; the child jostled her as he passed , then recoiled , exclaiming : -- `` Hello ! 
And I took it for an enormous , enormous dog ! '' 
He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals : `` an enormous , ENORMOUS dog . '' 
The old woman straightened herself up in a fury . 
`` Nasty brat ! '' 
she grumbled . 
`` If I had n't been bending over , I know well where I would have planted my foot on you . '' 
The boy was already far away . 
`` Kisss ! 
kisss ! '' 
he cried . 
`` After that , I do n't think I was mistaken ! '' 
The old woman , choking with indignation , now rose completely upright , and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face , all hollowed into angles and wrinkles , with crow 's - feet meeting the corners of her mouth . 
Her body was lost in the darkness , and only her head was visible . 
One would have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light from the night . 
The boy surveyed her . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me . '' 
He then pursued his road , and resumed his song : -- `` Le roi Coupdesabot S'en allait a la chasse , A la chasse aux corbeaux -- '' At the end of these three lines he paused . 
He had arrived in front of No. 50-52 , and finding the door fastened , he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks , which betrayed rather the man 's shoes that he was wearing than the child 's feet which he owned . 
In the meanwhile , the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him , uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures . 
`` What 's this ? 
What 's this ? 
Lord God ! 
He 's battering the door down ! 
He 's knocking the house down . '' 
The kicks continued . 
The old woman strained her lungs . 
`` Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays ? '' 
All at once she paused . 
She had recognized the gamin . 
`` What ! 
so it 's that imp ! '' 
`` Why , it 's the old lady , '' said the lad . 
`` Good day , Bougonmuche . 
I have come to see my ancestors . '' 
The old woman retorted with a composite grimace , and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness , which was , unfortunately , wasted in the dark : -- `` There 's no one here . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
retorted the boy , `` where 's my father ? '' 
`` At La Force . '' 
`` Come , now ! 
And my mother ? ''
