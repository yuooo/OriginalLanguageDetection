The wheel really had suffered serious damage . 
The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub , so that the nut no longer held firm . 
`` My friend , '' he said to the stableman , `` is there a wheelwright here ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Do me the service to go and fetch him . '' 
`` He is only a step from here . 
Hey ! 
Master Bourgaillard ! '' 
Master Bourgaillard , the wheelwright , was standing on his own threshold . 
He came , examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken . 
`` Can you repair this wheel immediately ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` When can I set out again ? '' 
`` To-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow ! '' 
`` There is a long day 's work on it . 
Are you in a hurry , sir ? '' 
`` In a very great hurry . 
I must set out again in an hour at the latest . '' 
`` Impossible , sir . '' 
`` I will pay whatever you ask . '' 
`` Impossible . '' 
`` Well , in two hours , then . '' 
`` Impossible to-day . 
Two new spokes and a hub must be made . 
Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning . '' 
`` The matter can not wait until to-morrow . 
What if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it ? '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` You are a wheelwright ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Have you not a wheel that you can sell me ? 
Then I could start again at once . '' 
`` A spare wheel ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet . 
Two wheels make a pair . 
Two wheels can not be put together hap-hazard . '' 
`` In that case , sell me a pair of wheels . '' 
`` Not all wheels fit all axles , sir . '' 
`` Try , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is useless , sir . 
I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels . 
We are but a poor country here . '' 
`` Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have ? '' 
The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle . 
He shrugged his shoulders . 
`` You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well ! 
If I had one , I would not let it to you ! '' 
`` Well , sell it to me , then . '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` What ! 
not even a spring-cart ? 
I am not hard to please , as you see . '' 
`` We live in a poor country . 
There is , in truth , '' added the wheelwright , `` an old calash under the shed yonder , which belongs to a bourgeois of the town , who gave it to me to take care of , and who only uses it on the thirty-sixth of the month -- never , that is to say . 
I might let that to you , for what matters it to me ? 
But the bourgeois must not see it pass -- and then , it is a calash ; it would require two horses . '' 
`` I will take two post-horses . '' 
`` Where is Monsieur going ? '' 
`` To Arras . '' 
`` And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` By taking two post-horses ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock to-morrow morning ? '' 
`` Certainly not . '' 
`` There is one thing to be said about that , you see , by taking post-horses -- Monsieur has his passport ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , by taking post-horses , Monsieur can not reach Arras before to-morrow . 
We are on a cross-road . 
The relays are badly served , the horses are in the fields . 
The season for ploughing is just beginning ; heavy teams are required , and horses are seized upon everywhere , from the post as well as elsewhere . 
Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay . 
And , then , they drive at a walk . 
There are many hills to ascend . '' 
`` Come then , I will go on horseback . 
Unharness the cabriolet . 
Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood . '' 
`` Without doubt . 
But will this horse bear the saddle ? '' 
`` That is true ; you remind me of that ; he will not bear it . '' 
`` Then -- '' `` But I can surely hire a horse in the village ? '' 
`` A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts . 
You would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you . 
But you will not find one for sale nor to let , for five hundred francs , or for a thousand . '' 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
`` The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man , and set out on your journey to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow will be too late . '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras ? 
When will it pass ? '' 
`` To-night . 
Both the posts pass at night ; the one going as well as the one coming . '' 
`` What ! 
It will take you a day to mend this wheel ? '' 
`` A day , and a good long one . '' 
`` If you set two men to work ? ''
