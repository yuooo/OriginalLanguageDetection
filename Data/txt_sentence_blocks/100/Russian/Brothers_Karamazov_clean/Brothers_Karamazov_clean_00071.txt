`` But he said I was a stinking lackey . 
He thinks that I might be unruly . 
He is mistaken there . 
If I had a certain sum in my pocket , I would have left here long ago . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his behaviour , in his mind , and in his poverty . 
He does n't know how to do anything , and yet he is respected by everyone . 
I may be only a soup-maker , but with luck I could open a cafe restaurant in Petrovka , in Moscow , for my cookery is something special , and there 's no one in Moscow , except the foreigners , whose cookery is anything special . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar , but if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country , he 'd fight him . 
Though in what way is he better than I am ? 
For he is ever so much stupider than I am . 
Look at the money he has wasted without any need ! '' 
`` It must be lovely , a duel , '' Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly . 
`` How so ? '' 
`` It must be so dreadful and so brave , especially when young officers with pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady . 
A perfect picture ! 
Ah , if only girls were allowed to look on , I 'd give anything to see one ! '' 
`` It 's all very well when you are firing at someone , but when he is firing straight in your mug , you must feel pretty silly . 
You 'd be glad to run away , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` You do n't mean you would run away ? '' 
But Smerdyakov did not deign to reply . 
After a moment 's silence the guitar tinkled again , and he sang again in the same falsetto : Whatever you may say , I shall go far away . 
Life will be bright and gay In the city far away . 
I shall not grieve , I shall not grieve at all , I do n't intend to grieve at all . 
Then something unexpected happened . 
Alyosha suddenly sneezed . 
They were silent . 
Alyosha got up and walked towards them . 
He found Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots , his hair pomaded , and perhaps curled . 
The guitar lay on the garden-seat . 
His companion was the daughter of the house , wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long . 
She was young and would not have been bad-looking , but that her face was so round and terribly freckled . 
`` Will my brother Dmitri soon be back ? 
asked Alyosha with as much composure as he could . 
Smerdyakov got up slowly ; Marya Kondratyevna rose too . 
`` How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? 
It 's not as if I were his keeper , '' answered Smerdyakov quietly , distinctly , and superciliously . 
`` But I simply asked whether you do know ? '' 
Alyosha explained . 
`` I know nothing of his whereabouts and do n't want to . '' 
`` But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the house , and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes . '' 
Smerdyakov turned a deliberate , unmoved glance upon him . 
`` And how did you get in this time , since the gate was bolted an hour ago ? '' 
he asked , looking at Alyosha . 
`` I came in from the back-alley , over the fence , and went straight to the summer-house . 
I hope you 'll forgive me , he added addressing Marya Kondratyevna . 
`` I was in a hurry to find my brother . '' 
`` Ach , as though we could take it amiss in you ! '' 
drawled Marya Kondratyevna , flattered by Alyosha 's apology . 
`` For Dmitri Fyodorovitch often goes to the summer-house in that way . 
We do n't know he is here and he is sitting in the summer-house . '' 
`` I am very anxious to find him , or to learn from you where he is now . 
Believe me , it 's on business of great importance to him . '' 
`` He never tells us , '' lisped Marya Kondratyevna . 
`` Though I used to come here as a friend , '' Smerdyakov began again , `` Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant questions about the master . 
` What news ? ' 
he 'll ask . 
` What 's going on in there now ? 
Who 's coming and going ? ' 
and ca n't I tell him something more . 
Twice already he 's threatened me with death `` With death ? '' 
Alyosha exclaimed in surprise . 
`` Do you suppose he 'd think much of that , with his temper , which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday ? 
He says if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there , I 'll be the first to suffer for it . 
I am terribly afraid of him , and if I were not even more afraid of doing so , I ought to let the police know . 
God only knows what he might not do ! '' 
`` His honour said to him the other day , ` I 'll pound you in a mortar ! ' '' 
added Marya Kondratyevna . 
`` Oh , if it 's pounding in a mortar , it may be only talk , '' observed Alyosha . 
`` If I could meet him , I might speak to him about that too . '' 
`` Well , the only thing I can tell you is this , '' said Smerdyakov , as though thinking better of it ; `` I am here as an old friend and neighbour , and it would be odd if I did n't come . 
On the other hand , Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother 's lodging in Lake Street , without a letter , but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here , in the marketplace . 
I went , but did n't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home , though it was eight o'clock . 
` He 's been here , but he is quite gone , ' those were the very words of his landlady . 
It 's as though there was an understanding between them . 
Perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch , for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago , and is gone to lie down . 
But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you , for he 'd kill me for nothing at all . '' 
`` Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day ? '' 
repeated Alyosha quickly . 
`` That 's so . '' 
`` The Metropolis tavern in the marketplace ? '' 
`` The very same . '' 
`` That 's quite likely , '' cried Alyosha , much excited . 
`` Thank you , Smerdyakov ; that 's important . 
I 'll go there at once . '' 
`` Do n't betray me , '' Smerdyakov called after him . 
`` Oh , no , I 'll go to the tavern as though by chance . 
Do n't be anxious . '' 
`` But wait a minute , I 'll open the gate to you , '' cried Marya Kondratyevna . 
`` No ; it 's a short cut , I 'll get over the fence again . '' 
What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation . 
He ran to the tavern . 
It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic dress , but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them down . 
But just as he reached the tavern , a window was flung open , and his brother Ivan called down to him from it . 
`` Alyosha , ca n't you come up here to me ? 
I shall be awfully grateful . '' 
`` To be sure I can , only I do n't quite know whether in this dress - '' `` But I am in a room apart . 
Come up the steps ; I 'll run down to meet you . '' 
A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother . 
Ivan was alone dining . 
The Brothers Make Friends IVAN was not , however , in a separate room , but only in a place shut off by a screen , so that it was unseen by other people in the room .
