Do n't you want to write it down ? '' 
said Mitya , with a distorted smile . 
`` No ; no need to write it down . 
But still you do have curious dreams . '' 
`` It 's not a question of dreams now , gentlemen - this is realism , this is real life ! 
I 'm a wolf and you 're the hunters . 
Well , hunt him down ! '' 
`` You are wrong to make such comparisons . '' 
began Nikolay Parfenovitch , with extraordinary softness . 
`` No , I 'm not wrong , at all ! '' 
Mitya flared up again , though his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart . 
He grew more good humoured at every word . 
`` You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions , but an honourable man , the honourable impulses of the heart -LRB- I say that boldly ! -RRB- 
- no ! 
That you must believe you have no right indeed ... but - Be silent , heart , Be patient , humble , hold thy peace . 
Well , shall I go on ? '' 
he broke off gloomily . 
`` If you 'll be so kind , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
The Third Ordeal THOUGH Mitya spoke sullenly , it was evident that he was trying more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story . 
He told them how he had leapt over the fence into his father 's garden ; how he had gone up to the window ; told them all that had passed under the window . 
Clearly , precisely , distinctly , he described the feelings that troubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was with his father or not . 
But , strange to say , both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve , looked coldly at him , asked few questions . 
Mitya could gather nothing from their faces . 
`` They 're angry and offended , '' he thought . 
`` Well , bother them ! '' 
When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the `` signal '' to his father that Grushenka had come , so that he should open the window , the lawyers paid no attention to the word `` signal , '' as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection : so much so , that Mitya noticed it . 
Coming at last to the moment when , seeing his father peering out of the window , his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket , he suddenly , as though of design , stopped short . 
He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the investigating lawyer . 
`` You pulled out the weapon and ... and what happened then ? 
`` Then ? 
Why , then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his skull ... . 
I suppose that 's your story . 
That 's it ! '' 
His eyes suddenly flashed . 
All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul . 
`` Our story ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent . 
`` My story , gentlemen ? 
Well , was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was someone 's tears , or my mother prayed to God , or a good angel kissed me at that instant , I do n't know . 
But the devil was conquered . 
I rushed from the window and ran to the fence . 
My father was alarmed and , for the first time , he saw me then , cried out , and sprang back from the window . 
I remember that very well . 
I ran across the garden to the fence ... and there Grigory caught me , when I was sitting on the fence . '' 
At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners . 
They seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention . 
A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya 's soul . 
`` Why , you 're laughing at me at this moment , gentlemen ! '' 
he broke off suddenly . 
`` What makes you think that ? '' 
observed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You do n't believe one word - that 's why ! 
I understand , of course , that I have come to the vital point . 
The old man 's lying there now with his skull broken , while I - after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him , and how I snatched up the pestle - I suddenly run away from the window . 
A romance ! 
Poetry ! 
As though one could believe a fellow on his word . 
Ha ha ! 
You are scoffers , gentlemen ! '' 
And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked . 
`` And did you notice , '' asked the prosecutor suddenly , as though not observing Mitya 's excitement , `` did you notice when you ran away from the window , whether the door into the garden was open ? '' 
`` No , it was not open . '' 
`` It was not ? '' 
`` It was shut . 
And who could open it ? 
Bah ! 
the door . 
Wait a bit ! '' 
he seemed suddenly to bethink himself , and almost with a start : `` Why , did you find the door open ? '' 
`` Yes , it was open . '' 
`` Why , who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves ? '' 
cried Mitya , greatly astonished . 
`` The door stood open , and your father 's murderer undoubtedly went in at that door , and , having accomplished the crime , went out again by the same door , '' the prosecutor pronounced deliberately , as though chiselling out each word separately . 
`` That is perfectly clear . 
The murder was committed in the room and not through the window ; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made , from the position of the body and everything . 
There can be no doubt of that circumstance . '' 
Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded . 
`` But that 's utterly impossible ! '' 
he cried , completely at a loss . 
`` I. . . 
I did n't go in ... . 
I tell you positively , definitely , the door was shut the whole time I was in the garden , and when I ran out of the garden . 
I only stood at the window and saw him through the window . 
That 's all , that 's all ... . 
I remember to the last minute . 
And if I did n't remember , it would be just the same . 
I know it , for no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov , and me , and the dead man . 
And he would n't have opened the door to anyone in the world without the signals . '' 
`` Signals ? 
What signals ? '' 
asked the prosecutor , with greedy , almost hysterical , curiosity . 
He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and dignity . 
He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity . 
He scented an important fact of which he had known nothing , and was already filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it . 
`` So you did n't know ! ''
