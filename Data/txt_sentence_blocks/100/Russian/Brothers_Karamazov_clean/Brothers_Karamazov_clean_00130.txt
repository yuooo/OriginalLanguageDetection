`` But did you serve in the cavalry ? 
You were talking about the cavalry . 
Were you a cavalry officer ? '' 
put in Kalgonov at once . 
`` Was he a cavalry officer indeed ? 
Ha ha ! '' 
cried Mitya , listening eagerly , and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke , as though there were no knowing what he might hear from each . 
`` No , you see , '' Maximov turned to him . 
`` What I mean is that those pretty Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a kitten ... a little white one ... and the pan-father and pan-mother look on and allow it ... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes and offers her his hand ... . 
That 's how it is ... offers her his hand , he he ! '' 
Maximov ended , tittering . 
`` The pan is a lajdak ! '' 
* the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and crossed one leg over the other . 
Mitya 's eye was caught by his huge greased boot , with its thick , dirty sole . 
The dress of both the Poles looked rather greasy . 
* Scoundrel . 
`` Well , now it 's lajdak ! 
What 's he scolding about ? '' 
said Grushenka , suddenly vexed . 
`` Pani Agrippina , what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls , and not ladies of good birth , '' the Pole with the pipe observed to Grushenka . 
`` You can reckon on that , '' the tall Pole snapped contemptuously . 
`` What next ! 
Let him talk ! 
People talk , why hinder them ? 
It makes it cheerful , '' Grushenka said crossly . 
`` I 'm not hindering them , pani , '' said the Pole in the wig , with a long look at Grushenka , and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe again . 
`` No , no . 
The Polish gentleman spoke the truth . '' 
Kalgonov got excited again , as though it were a question of vast import . 
`` He 's never been in Poland , so how can he talk about it ? 
I suppose you were n't married in Poland , were you ? '' 
`` No , in the Province of Smolensk . 
Only , a Uhlan had brought her to Russia before that , my future wife , with her mamma and her aunt , and another female relation with a grown-up son . 
He brought her straight from Poland and gave her up to me . 
He was a lieutenant in our regiment , a very nice young man . 
At first he meant to marry her himself . 
But he did n't marry her , because she turned out to be lame . '' 
`` So you married a lame woman ? '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` Yes . 
They both deceived me a little bit at the time , and concealed it . 
I thought she was hopping ; she kept hopping ... . 
I thought it was for fun . '' 
`` So pleased she was going to marry you ! '' 
yelled Kalganov , in a ringing , childish voice . 
`` Yes , so pleased . 
But it turned out to be quite a different cause . 
Afterwards , when we were married , after the wedding , that very evening , she confessed , and very touchingly asked forgiveness . ' 
I once jumped over a puddle when I was a child , ' she said , ` and injured my leg . ' 
He he ! '' 
Kalgonov went off into the most childish laughter , almost falling on the sofa . 
Grushenka , too , laughed . 
Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness . 
`` Do you know , that 's the truth , he 's not lying now , '' exclaimed Kalganov , turning to Mitya ; `` and do you know , he 's been married twice ; it 's his first wife he 's talking about . 
But his second wife , do you know , ran away , and is alive now . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
said Mitya , turning quickly to Maximov with an expression of the utmost astonishment . 
`` Yes . 
She did run away . 
I 've had that unpleasant experience , '' Maximov modestly assented , `` with a monsieur . 
And what was worse , she 'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand . 
` You 're an educated man , ' she said to me . 
` You can always get your living . ' 
She settled my business with that . 
A venerable bishop once said to me : ` One of your wives was lame , but the other was too light-footed . ' 
He he ! 
`` Listen , listen ! '' 
cried Kalganov , bubbling over , `` if he 's telling lies - and he often is - he 's only doing it to amuse us all . 
There 's no harm in that , is there ? 
You know , I sometimes like him . 
He 's awfully low , but it 's natural to him , eh ? 
Do n't you think so ? 
Some people are low from self-interest , but he 's simply so , from nature . 
Only fancy , he claims -LRB- he was arguing about it all the way yesterday -RRB- that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him . 
Do you remember , there 's a landowner called Maximov in it , whom Nozdryov thrashed . 
He was charged , do you remember , ` for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition . ' 
Would you believe it , he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten ! 
Now can it be so ? 
Tchitchikov made his journey , at the very latest , at the beginning of the twenties , so that the dates do n't fit . 
He could n't have been thrashed then , he could n't , could he ? '' 
It was diffcult to imagine what Kalgonov was excited about , but his excitement was genuine . 
Mitya followed his lead without protest . 
`` Well , but if they did thrash him ! '' 
he cried , laughing . 
`` It 's not that they thrashed me exactly , but what I mean is - '' put in Maximov . 
`` What do you mean ? 
Either they thrashed you or they did n't . '' 
`` What o'clock is it , panie ? '' 
the Pole , with the pipe , asked his tall friend , with a bored expression . 
The other shrugged his shoulders in reply . 
Neither of them had a watch . 
`` Why not talk ? 
Let other people talk . 
Must n't other people talk because you 're bored ? '' 
Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding fault . 
Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya 's mind . 
This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability . 
`` Pani , I did n't oppose it . 
I did n't say anything . '' 
`` All right then .
