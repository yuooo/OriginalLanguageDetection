`` The doctor has come ! '' 
cried Nina , who had been silent till then . 
A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate . 
The captain , who had been expecting the doctor all the morning , rushed headlong out to meet him . 
`` Mamma '' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air . 
Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight . 
Nina , from her invalid chair , anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy . 
The boys hurriedly took leave . 
Some of them promised to come again in the evening . 
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed . 
`` I wo n't go away , I wo n't go away , '' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha . 
`` I 'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor 's gone , I 'll come back with Perezvon . '' 
But by now the doctor had entered , an important-looking person with long , dark whiskers and a shiny , shaven chin , wearing a bearskin coat . 
As he crossed the threshold he stopped , taken aback ; he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place . 
`` How is this ? 
Where am I ? '' 
he muttered , not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap . 
The crowd , the poverty of the room , the washing hanging on a line in the corner , puzzled him . 
The captain , bent double , was bowing low before him . 
`` It 's here , sir , here , sir , '' he muttered cringingly ; `` it 's here , you 've come right , you were coming to us ... '' `` Sne-gi-ryov ? '' 
the doctor said loudly and pompously . 
`` Mr. Snegiryov - is that you ? '' 
`` That 's me , sir ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his coat , displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck . 
The captain caught the fur coat in the air , and the doctor took off his cap . 
`` Where is the patient ? '' 
he asked emphatically . 
Precocity `` WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him ? '' 
Kolya asked quickly . 
`` What a repulsive mug , though , has n't he ? 
I ca n't endure medicine ! '' 
`` Ilusha is dying . 
I think that 's certain , '' answered Alyosha , mournfully . 
`` They are rogues ! 
Medicine 's a fraud ! 
I am glad to have made your acquaintance , though , Karamazov . 
I wanted to know you for a long time . 
I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances . '' 
Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative , but he felt ill at ease . 
Alyosha noticed this , smiled , and pressed his hand . 
`` I 've long learned to respect you as a rare person , '' Kolya muttered again , faltering and uncertain . 
`` I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery . 
I know you are a mystic , but ... that has n't put me off . 
Contact with real life will cure you ... . 
It 's always so with characters like yours . '' 
`` What do you mean by mystic ? 
Cure me of what ? '' 
Alyosha was rather astonished . 
`` Oh , God and all the rest of it . '' 
`` What , do n't you believe in God ? '' 
`` Oh , I 've nothing against God . 
Of course , God is only a hypothesis , but ... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all that ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented , '' added Kolya , beginning to blush . 
He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was `` grown up . '' 
`` I have n't the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him , '' Kolya thought indignantly . 
And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed . 
`` I must confess I ca n't endure entering on such discussions , '' he said with a final air . 
`` It 's possible for one who does n't believe in God to love mankind , do n't you think so ? 
Voltaire did n't believe in God and loved mankind ? '' 
-LRB- `` I am at it again , '' he thought to himself . -RRB- 
`` Voltaire believed in God , though not very much , I think , and I do n't think he loved mankind very much either , '' said Alyosha quietly , gently , and quite naturally , as though he were talking to someone of his own age , or even older . 
Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha 's apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire . 
He seemed to be leaving the question for him , little Kolya , to settle . 
`` Have you read Voltaire ? '' 
Alyosha finished . 
`` No , not to say read ... . 
But I 've read Candide in the Russian translation ... in an absurd , grotesque , old translation . . 
-LRB- At it again ! 
again ! -RRB- '' 
`` And did you understand it ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , everything ... . 
That is ... Why do you suppose I should n't understand it ? 
There 's a lot of nastiness in it , of course ... . 
Of course I can understand that it 's a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea ... '' Kolya was getting mixed by now . 
`` I am a Socialist , Karamazov , I am an incurable Socialist , '' he announced suddenly , apropos of nothing . 
`` A Socialist ? '' 
laughed Alyosha . 
`` But when have you had time to become one ? 
Why , I thought you were only thirteen ? '' 
Kolya winced . 
`` In the first place I am not thirteen , but fourteen , fourteen in a fortnight , '' he flushed angrily , `` and in the second place I am at a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it ? 
The question is what are my convictions , not what is my age , is n't it ? '' 
`` When you are older , you 'll understand for yourself the influence of age on convictions . 
I fancied , too , that you were not expressing your own ideas , '' Alyosha answered serenely and modestly , but Kolya interrupted him hotly : `` Come , you want obedience and mysticism . 
You must admit that the Christian religion , for instance , has only been of use to the rich and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery . 
That 's so , is n't it ? '' 
`` Ah , I know where you read that , and I am sure someone told you so ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` I say , what makes you think I read it ? 
And certainly no one told so . 
I can think for myself ... . 
I am not opposed to Christ , if you like . 
He was a most humane person , and if He were alive to-day , He would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists , and would perhaps play a conspicuous part ... . 
There 's no doubt about that . '' 
`` Oh , where , where did you get that from ? 
What fool have you made friends with ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` Come , the truth will out ! 
It has so chanced that I have often talked to Mr. Rakitin , of course , but ... old Byelinsky said that , too , so they say . '' 
`` Byelinsky ?
