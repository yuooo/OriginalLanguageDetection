Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him . 
Alyosha could make no protest , though he had a great longing to remain . 
He longed , moreover , to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri , the question was on the tip of his tongue , but he dared not ask it . 
He knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had thought fit . 
But evidently it was not his will . 
That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha ; he believed blindly in its mysterious significance . 
Mysterious , and perhaps awful . 
As he hastened out of the hermatage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior 's dinner , he felt a sudden pang at his heart , and stopped short . 
He seemed to hear again Father Zossima 's words , foretelling his approaching end . 
What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass . 
Alyosha believed that implicitly . 
But how could he go ? 
He had told him not to weep , and to leave the monastery . 
Good God ! 
It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish . 
He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage , and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts , he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path . 
He had not far to go - about five hundred paces . 
He expected to meet no one at that hour , but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin . 
He was waiting for someone . 
`` Are you waiting for me ? '' 
asked Alyosha , overtaking him . 
`` Yes , '' grinned Rakitin . 
`` You are hurrying to the Father Superior , I know ; he has a banquet . 
There 's not been such a banquet since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov , do you remember ? 
I sha n't be there , but you go and hand the sauces . 
Tell me one thing , Alexey , what does that vision mean ? 
That 's what I want to ask you . '' 
`` What vision ? '' 
`` That bowing to your brother , Dmitri . 
And did n't he tap the ground with his forehead , too ! '' 
`` You speak of Father Zossima ? '' 
`` Yes , of Father Zossima , '' `` Tapped the ground ? '' 
`` Ah , an irreverent expression ! 
Well , what of it ? 
Anyway , what does that vision mean ? '' 
`` I do n't know what it means , Misha . '' 
`` I knew he would n't explain it to you There 's nothing wonderful about it , of course , only the usual holy mummery . 
But there was an object in the performance . 
All the pious people in the town will talk about it and spread the story through the province , wondering what it meant . 
To my thinking the old man really has a keen nose ; he sniffed a crime . 
Your house stinks of it . '' 
Rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of . 
`` It 'll be in your family , this crime . 
Between your brothers and your rich old father . 
So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn up . 
If something happens later on , it 'll be : ` Ah , the holy man foresaw it , prophesied it ! ' 
though it 's a poor sort of prophecy , flopping like that . 
` Ah , but it was symbolic , ' they 'll say , ` an allegory , ' and the devil knows what all ! 
It 'll be remembered to his glory : ` He predicted the crime and marked the criminal ! ' 
That 's always the way with these crazy fanatics ; they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple . 
Like your elder , he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a murderer . '' 
`` What crime ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
Alyosha stopped dead . 
Rakitin stopped , too . 
`` What murderer ? 
As though you did n't know ! 
I 'll bet you 've thought of it before . 
That 's interesting , too , by the way . 
Listen , Alyosha , you always speak the truth , though you 're always between two stools . 
Have you thought of it or not ? 
Answer . '' 
`` I have , '' answered Alyosha in a low voice . 
Even Rakitin was taken aback . 
`` What ? 
Have you really ? '' 
he cried . 
`` I. . . 
I 've not exactly thought it , '' muttered Alyosha , `` but directly you began speaking so strangely , I fancied I had thought of it myself . '' 
`` You see ? 
-LRB- And how well you expressed it ! -RRB- 
Looking at your father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime . 
Then I 'm not mistaken ? '' 
`` But wait , wait a minute , '' Alyosha broke in uneasily , `` What has led you to see all this ? 
Why does it interest you ? 
That 's the first question . '' 
`` Two questions , disconnected , but natural . 
I 'll deal with them separately . 
What led me to see it ? 
I should n't have seen it , if I had n't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri , seen right into the very heart of him all at once . 
I caught the whole man from one trait . 
These very honest but passionate people have a line which must n't be crossed . 
If it were , he 'd run at your father with a knife . 
But your father 's a drunken and abandoned old sinner , who can never draw the line - if they both themselves go , they 'll both come to grief . '' 
`` No , Misha , no . 
If that 's all , you 've reassured me . 
It wo n't come to that . '' 
`` But why are you trembling ? 
Let me tell you ; he may be honest , our Mitya -LRB- he is stupid , but honest -RRB- , but he 's - a sensualist . 
That 's the very definition and inner essence of him . 
It 's your father has handed him on his low sensuality . 
Do you know , I simply wonder at you , Alyosha , how you can have kept your purity . 
You 're a Karamazov too , you know ! 
In your family sensuality is carried to a disease . 
But now , these three sensualists are watching one another , with their knives in their belts . 
The three of them are knocking their heads together , and you may be the fourth . '' 
`` You are mistaken about that woman . 
Dmitri despises her , '' said Alyosha , with a sort of shudder . 
`` Grushenka ? 
No , brother , he does n't despise her .
