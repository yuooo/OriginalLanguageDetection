He did not belong to anyone ! '' 
he explained , to the captain , to his wife , to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha . 
`` He used to live in the Fedotovs ' backyard . 
Though he made his home there , they did not feed him . 
He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I found him ... . 
You see , old man , he could n't have swallowed what you gave him . 
If he had , he must have died , he must have ! 
So he must have spat it out , since he is alive . 
You did not see him do it . 
But the pin pricked his tongue , that is why he squealed . 
He ran away squealing and you thought he 'd swallowed it . 
He might well squeal , because the skin of dogs ' mouths is so tender ... tenderer than in men , much tenderer ! '' 
Kolya cried impetuously , his face glowing and radiant with delight . 
Ilusha could not speak . 
White as a sheet , he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya , with his great eyes almost starting out of his head . 
And if Krassotkin , who had no suspicion of it , had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child 's health , nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him . 
But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realised it . 
As for the captain he behaved like a small child . 
`` Zhutchka ! 
It 's Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried in a blissful voice , `` Ilusha , this is Zhutchka , your Zhutchka ! 
Mamma , this is Zhutchka ! '' 
He was almost weeping . 
`` And I never guessed ! '' 
cried Smurov regretfully . 
`` Bravo , Krassotkin ! 
I said he 'd find the dog and here he 's found him . '' 
`` Here he 's found him ! '' 
another boy repeated gleefully . 
`` Krassotkin 's a brick ! 
cried a third voice . 
`` He 's a brick , he 's a brick ! '' 
cried the other boys , and they began clapping . 
`` Wait , wait , '' Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all . 
`` I 'll tell you how it happened , that 's the whole point . 
I found him , I took him home and hid him at once . 
I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to anyone till to-day . 
Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight , but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess . 
And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks . 
You should only see all the things he can do ! 
I trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog , in good condition , old man , so as to be able to say to you , ` See , old man , what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now ! ' 
Have n't you a bit of meat ? 
He 'll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing . 
A piece of meat , have n't you got any ? '' 
The captain ran across the passage to the landlady , where their cooking was done . 
Not to lose precious time , Kolya , in desperate haste , shouted to Perezvon , `` Dead ! '' 
And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air . 
The boys laughed , Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile , but the person most delighted with the dog 's performance was `` mamma . '' 
She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it , `` Perezvon , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Nothing will make him get up , nothing ! '' 
Kolya cried triumphantly , proud of his success . 
`` He wo n't move for all the shouting in the world , but if I call to him , he 'll jump up in a minute . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
The dog leapt up and bounded about , whining with delight . 
The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef . 
`` Is it hot ? '' 
Kolya inquired hurriedly , with a business-like air , taking the meat . 
`` Dogs do n't like hot things . 
No , it 's all right . 
Look , everybody , look , Ilusha , look , old man ; why are n't you looking ? 
He does not look at him , now I 've brought him . '' 
The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose . 
The luckless dog had to stand without moving , with the meat on his nose , as long as his master chose to keep him , without a movement , perhaps for half an hour . 
But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment . 
`` Paid for ! '' 
cried Kolya , and the meat passed in a flash from the dog 's nose to his mouth . 
The audience , of course , expressed enthusiasm and surprise . 
`` Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha , with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice . 
`` Simply for that ! '' 
answered Kolya , with perfect simplicity . 
`` I wanted to show him in all his glory . '' 
`` Perezvon ! 
Perezvon , '' called Ilusha suddenly , snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog . 
`` What is it ? 
Let him jump up on the bed ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha . 
The boy threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek . 
Ilusha crept close to him , stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog 's shaggy coat . 
`` Dear , dear ! '' 
kept exclaiming the captain . 
Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed . 
`` Ilusha , I can show you another trick . 
I 've brought you a little cannon . 
You remember , I told you about it before and you said how much you 'd like to see it . 
Well , here , I 've brought it to you . '' 
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon . 
He hurried , because he was happy himself . 
Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off , now he hurried on , regardless of all consideration . 
`` You are all happy now , '' he felt , `` so here 's something to make you happier ! '' 
He was perfectly enchanted himself . 
`` I 've been coveting this thing for a long while ; it 's for you , old man , it 's for you . 
It belonged to Morozov , it was no use to him , he had it from his brother . 
I swopped a book from father 's book-case for it , A Kinsman of Mahomet , or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago , before they had any censorship . 
And Morozov has a taste for such things . 
He was grateful to me , too ... '' Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it . 
Ilusha raised himself , and , with his right arm still round the dog , he gazed enchanted at the toy . 
The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too , and that it could be fired off at once `` if it wo n't alarm the ladies . '' 
`` Mamma '' immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted .
