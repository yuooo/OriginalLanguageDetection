Come , tell us your story , '' Grushenka cried to Maximov . 
`` Why are you all silent ? '' 
`` There 's nothing to tell , it 's all so foolish , '' answered Maximov at once , with evident satisfaction , mincing a little . 
`` Besides , all that 's by way of allegory in Gogol , for he 's made all the names have a meaning . 
Nozdryov was really called Nosov , and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name , he was called Shkvornev . 
Fenardi really was called Fenardi , only he was n't an Italian but a Russian , and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights , and she had a little short skirt with spangles , and she kept turning round and round , only not for four hours but for four minutes only , and she bewitched everyone ... '' `` But what were you beaten for ? '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` For Piron ! '' 
answered Maximov . 
`` What Piron ? '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` The famous French writer , Piron . 
We were all drinking then , a big party of us , in a tavern at that very fair . 
They 'd invited me , and first of all I began quoting epigrams . 
` Is that you , Boileau ? 
What a funny get-up ! ' 
and Boileau answers that he 's going to a masquerade , that is to the baths , he he ! 
And they took it to themselves , so I made haste to repeat another , very sarcastic , well known to all educated people : Yes , Sappho and Phaon are we ! 
But one grief is weighing on me . 
You do n't know your way to the sea ! 
`` They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it . 
And as ill-luck would have it , to set things right , I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron , how he was not accepted into the French Academy , and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph : Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien , Pas meme academicien , * * Here lies Piron , who was nothing , not even an Academician . 
They seized me and thrashed me . '' 
`` But what for ? 
What for ? '' 
`` For my education . 
People can thrash a man for anything , '' Maximov concluded , briefly and sententiously . 
`` Eh , that 's enough ! 
That 's all stupid , I do n't want to listen . 
I thought it would be amusing , '' Grushenka cut them short , suddenly . 
Mitya started , and at once left off laughing . 
The tall Pole rose upon his feet , and with the haughty air of a man , bored and out of his element , began pacing from corner to corner of the room , his hands behind his back . 
`` Ah , he ca n't sit still , '' said Grushenka , looking at him contemptuously . 
Mitya began to feel anxious . 
He noticed besides , that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression . 
`` Panie ! '' 
cried Mitya , `` Let 's drink ! 
and the other pan , too ! 
Let us drink . '' 
In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him , and filled them with champagne . 
`` To Poland , Panovie , I drink to your Poland ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I shall be delighted , panie , '' said the Pole on the sofa , with dignity and affable condescension , and he took his glass . 
`` And the other pan , what 's his name ? 
Drink , most illustrious , take your glass ! '' 
Mitya urged . 
`` Pan Vrublevsky , '' put in the Pole on the sofa . 
Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table , swaying as he walked . 
`` To Poland , Panovie ! '' 
cried Mitya , raisin , his glass . 
`` Hurrah ! '' 
All three drank . 
Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses . 
`` Now to Russia , Panovie , and let us be brothers ! '' 
`` Pour out some for us , '' said Grushenka ; `` I 'll drink to Russia , too ! '' 
`` So will I , '' said Kalganov . 
`` And I would , too ... to Russia , the old grandmother ! '' 
tittered Maximov . 
`` All ! 
All ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Trifon Borissovitch , some more bottles ! '' 
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table . 
Mitya filled the glasses . 
`` To Russia ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
he shouted again . 
All drank the toast except the Poles , and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once . 
The Poles did not touch theirs . 
`` How 's this , Panovie ? '' 
cried Mitya , `` wo n't you drink it ? '' 
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass , raised it and said with a resonant voice : `` To Russia as she was before 1772 . '' 
`` Come , that 's better ! '' 
cried the other Pole , and they both emptied their glasses at once . 
`` You 're fools , you Panovie , '' broke suddenly from Mitya . 
`` Panie ! '' 
shouted both the Poles , menacingly , setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks . 
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious . 
`` Can one help loving one 's own country ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Be silent ! 
Do n't quarrel ! 
I wo n't have any quarrelling ! '' 
cried Grushenka imperiously , and she stamped her foot on the floor . 
Her face glowed , her eyes were shining . 
The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent . 
Mitya was terribly alarmed . 
`` Panovie , forgive me ! 
It was my fault , I 'm sorry . 
Vrublevsky , panie Vrublevsky , I 'm sorry . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , you , anyway ! 
Sit down , you stupid ! '' . 
Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance . 
Everyone sat down , all were silent , looking at one another . 
`` Gentlemen , I was the cause of it all , '' Mitya began again , unable to make anything of Grushenka 's words . 
`` Come , why are we sitting here ? 
What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again ? '' 
`` Ach , it 's certainly anything but amusing ! '' 
Kalgonov mumbled lazily . 
`` Let 's play faro again , as we did just now , '' Maximov tittered suddenly .
