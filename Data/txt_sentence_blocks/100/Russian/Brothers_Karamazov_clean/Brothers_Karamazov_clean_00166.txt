Kolya scanned him gravely . 
`` Have you been to the Church of the Ascension ? '' 
he suddenly asked him , with stern emphasis . 
`` What Church of Ascension ? 
What for ? 
No , I have n't , '' said the young man , somewhat taken aback . 
`` Do you know Sabaneyev ? '' 
Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely . 
`` What Sabaneyev ? 
No , I do n't know him . '' 
`` Well then you can go to the devil , '' said Kolya , cutting short the conversation ; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev . 
`` Stop , heigh ! 
What Sabaneyev ? '' 
the young man recovered from his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before . 
`` What did he say ? '' 
He turned to the market women with a silly stare . 
The women laughed . 
`` You can never tell what he 's after , '' said one of them . 
`` What Sabaneyev is it he 's talking about ? '' 
the young man repeated , still furious and brandishing his right arm . 
`` It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs , that 's who it must be , '' one of the women suggested . 
The young man stared at her wildly . 
`` For the Kuzmitchovs ? '' 
repeated another woman . 
`` But his name was n't Trifon . 
His name 's Kuzma , not Trifon ; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch , so it ca n't be the same . '' 
`` His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev , it 's Tchizhov , '' put in suddenly a third woman , who had hitherto been silent , listening gravely . 
`` Alexey Ivanitch is his name . 
Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch . '' 
`` Not a doubt about it , it 's Tchizhov , '' a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement . 
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another . 
`` But what did he ask for , what did he ask for , good people ? '' 
he cried almost in desperation . '' 
` Do you know Sabaneyev ? ' 
says he . 
And who the devil 's to know who is Sabaneyev ? '' 
`` You 're a senseless fellow . 
I tell you it 's not Sabaneyev , but Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov , that 's who it is ! '' 
one of the women shouted at him impressively . 
`` What Tchizhov ? 
Who is he ? 
Tell me , if you know . '' 
`` That tall , snivelling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer . '' 
`` And what 's your Tchizhov to do with me , good people , eh ? '' 
`` How can I tell what he 's to do with you ? '' 
put in another . 
`` You ought to know yourself what you want with him , if you make such a clamour about him . 
He spoke to you , he did not speak to us , you stupid . 
Do n't you really know him ? '' 
`` Know whom ? '' 
`` Tchizhov . '' 
`` The devil take Tchizhov and you with him . 
I 'll give him a hiding , that I will . 
He was laughing at me ! '' 
`` Will give Tchizhov a hiding ! 
More likely he will give you one . 
You are a fool , that 's what you are ! '' 
`` Not Tchizhov , not Tchizhov , you spiteful , mischievous woman . 
I 'll give the boy a hiding . 
Catch him , catch him , he was laughing at me The woman guffawed . 
But Kolya was by now a long way off , marching along with a triumphant air . 
Smurov walked beside him , looking round at the shouting group far behind . 
He too was in high spirits , though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya 's company . 
`` What Sabaneyev did you mean ? '' 
he asked Kolya , foreseeing what his answer would be . 
`` How do I know ? 
Now there 'll be a hubbub among them all day . 
I like to stir up fools in every class of society . 
There 's another blockhead , that peasant there . 
You know , they say ` there 's no one stupider than a stupid Frenchman , ' but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much . 
Ca n't you see it all over his face that he is a fool , that peasant , eh ? '' 
`` Let him alone , Kolya . 
Let 's go on . '' 
`` Nothing could stop me , now I am once off . 
Hey , good morning , peasant ! '' 
A sturdy-looking peasant , with a round , simple face and grizzled beard , who was walking by , raised his head and looked at the boy . 
He seemed not quite sober . 
`` Good morning , if you are not laughing at me , '' he said deliberately in reply . 
`` And if I am ? '' 
laughed Kolya . 
`` Well , a joke 's a joke . 
Laugh away . 
I do n't mind . 
There 's no harm in a joke . '' 
`` I beg your pardon , brother , it was a joke . '' 
`` Well , God forgive you ! '' 
`` Do you forgive me , too ? '' 
`` I quite forgive you . 
Go along . '' 
`` I say , you seem a clever peasant . '' 
`` Cleverer than you , '' the peasant answered unexpectedly , with the same gravity . 
`` I doubt it , '' said Kolya , somewhat taken aback . 
`` It 's true , though . '' 
`` Perhaps it is . '' 
`` It is , brother . '' 
`` Good-bye , peasant ! '' 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` There are all sorts of peasants , '' Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence . 
`` How could I tell I had hit on a clever one ? 
I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry . ''
