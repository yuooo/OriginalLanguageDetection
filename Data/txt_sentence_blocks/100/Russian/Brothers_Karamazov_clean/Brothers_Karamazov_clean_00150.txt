After resting , he went on with his story . 
But he was evidently depressed . 
He was exhausted , mortified , and morally shaken . 
To make things worse the prosecutor exasperated him , as though intentionally , by vexatious interruptions about `` trifling points . '' 
Scarcely had Mitya described how , sitting on the wall , he had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle , while the old man had hold of his left leg , and how he then jumped down to look at him , when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall . 
Mitya was surprised . 
`` Oh , I was sitting like this , astride , one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other . '' 
`` And the pestle ? '' 
`` The pestle was in my hand . '' 
`` Not in your pocket ? 
Do you remember that precisely ? 
Was it a violent blow you gave him ? '' 
`` It must have been a violent one . 
But why do you ask ? '' 
`` Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm , and in what direction ? '' 
`` You 're making fun of me , are n't you ? '' 
asked Mitya , looking haughtily at the speaker ; but the latter did not flinch . 
Mitya turned abruptly , sat astride on his chair , and swung his arm . 
`` This was how I struck him ! 
That 's how I knocked him down ! 
What more do you want ? '' 
`` Thank you . 
May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down , with what object , and what you had in view ? '' 
`` Oh , hang it ! 
... I jumped down to look at the man I 'd hurt ... I do n't know what for ! '' 
`` Though you were so excited and were running away ? '' 
`` Yes , though I was excited and running away . '' 
`` You wanted to help him ? '' 
`` Help ! 
... Yes , perhaps I did want to help him ... . 
I do n't remember . '' 
`` You do n't remember ? 
Then you did n't quite know what you were doing ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
I remember everything - every detail . 
I jumped down to look at him , and wiped his face with my handkerchief . '' 
`` We have seen your handkerchief . 
Did you hope to restore him to consciousness ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether I hoped it . 
I simply wanted to make sure whether he was alive or not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
You wanted to be sure ? 
Well , what then ? '' 
`` I 'm not a doctor . 
I could n't decide . 
I ran away thinking I 'd killed him . 
And now he 's recovered . '' 
`` Excellent , '' commented the prosecutor . 
`` Thank you . 
That 's all I wanted . 
Kindly proceed . '' 
Alas ! 
it never entered Mitya 's head to tell them , though he remembered it , that he had jumped back from pity , and standing over the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret : `` You 've come to grief , old man - there 's no help for it . 
Well , there you must lie . '' 
The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion : that the man had jumped back `` at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his crime were dead ; that he must therefore have been a man of great strength , coolness , decision , and foresight even at such a moment , '' ... and so on . 
The prosecutor was satisfied : `` I 've provoked the nervous fellow by ` trifles ' and he has said more than he meant With painful effort Mitya went on . 
But this time he was pulled up immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` How came you to run to the servant , Fedosya Markovna , with your hands so covered with blood , and , as it appears , your face , too ? '' 
`` Why , I did n't notice the blood at all at the time , '' answered Mitya . 
`` That 's quite likely . 
It does happen sometimes . '' 
The prosecutor exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` I simply did n't notice . 
You 're quite right there , prosecutor , '' Mitya assented suddenly . 
Next came the account of Mitya 's sudden determination to `` step aside '' and make way for their happiness . 
But he could not make up his mind to open his heart to them as before , and tell them about `` the queen of his soul . '' 
He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons `` who were fastening on him like bugs . '' 
And so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly : `` Well , I made up my mind to kill myself . 
What had I left to live for ? 
That question stared me in the face . 
Her first rightful lover had come back , the man who wronged her but who 'd hurried back to offer his love , after five years , and atone for the wrong with marriage ... . 
So I knew it was all over for me ... . 
And behind me disgrace , and that blood - Grigory 's ... . 
What had I to live for ? 
So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged , to load them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow . '' 
`` And a grand feast the night before ? '' 
`` Yes , a grand feast the night before . 
Damn it all , gentlemen ! 
Do make haste and finish it . 
I meant to shoot myself not far from here , beyond the village , and I 'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning . 
And I had a note in my pocket already . 
I wrote it at Perhotin 's when I loaded my pistols . 
Here 's the letter . 
Read it ! 
It 's not for you I tell it , '' he added contemptuously . 
He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table . 
The lawyers read it with curiosity , and , as is usual , added it to the papers connected with the case . 
`` And you did n't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin 's ? 
You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion ? '' 
`` What suspicion ? 
Suspicion or not , I should have galloped here just the same , and shot myself at five o'clock , and you would n't have been in time to do anything . 
If it had n't been for what 's happened to my father , you would have known nothing about it , and would n't have come here . 
Oh , it 's the devil 's doing . 
It was the devil murdered father , it was through the devil that you found it out so soon . 
How did you manage to get here so quick ? 
It 's marvellous , a dream ! '' 
`` Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him , you held in your hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a bundle of hundred-rouble notes , and that his servant-boy saw it too . '' 
`` That 's true , gentlemen . 
I remember it was so . '' 
`` Now , there 's one little point presents itself .
