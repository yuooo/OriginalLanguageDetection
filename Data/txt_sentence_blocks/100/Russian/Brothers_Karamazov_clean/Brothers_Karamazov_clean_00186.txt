You never lie to me , do n't lie now ; is it true ? 
You are not laughing ? '' 
`` It 's true . '' 
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent . 
`` Alyosha , come and see me , come and see me more often , '' she said suddenly , in a supplicating voice . 
`` I 'll always come to see you , all my life , '' answered Alyosha firmly . 
`` You are the only person I can talk to , you know , '' Lise began again . 
`` I talk to no one but myself and you . 
Only you in the whole world . 
And to you more readily than to myself . 
And I am not a bit ashamed with you , not a bit . 
Alyosha , why am I not ashamed with you , not a bit ? 
Alyosha , is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` There 's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew , who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands , and then crucified him on the wall , hammered nails into him and crucified him , and afterwards , when he was tried , he said that the child died soon , within four hours . 
That was ` soon ' ! 
He said the child moaned , kept on moaning and he stood admiring it . 
That 's nice ! '' 
`` Nice ? '' 
`` Nice ; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him . 
He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple compote . 
I am awfully fond of pineapple compote . 
Do you like it ? '' 
Alyosha looked at her in silence . 
Her pale , sallow face was suddenly contorted , her eyes burned . 
`` You know , when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night . 
I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned -LRB- a child of four years old understands , you know -RRB- , and all the while the thought of pineapple compote haunted me . 
In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person , begging him particularly to come and see me . 
He came and I suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple compote . 
All about it , all , and said that it was nice . 
He laughed and said it really was nice . 
Then he got up and went away . 
He was only here five minutes . 
Did he despise me ? 
Did he despise me ? 
Tell me , tell me , Alyosha , did he despise me or not ? '' 
She sat up on the couch , with flashing eyes . 
`` Tell me , '' Alyosha asked anxiously , `` did you send for that person ? '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` Did you send him a letter ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Simply to ask about that , about that child ? '' 
`` No , not about that at all . 
But when he came , I asked him about that at once . 
He answered , laughed , got up and went away . '' 
`` That person behaved honourably , '' Alyosha murmured . 
`` And did he despise me ? 
Did he laugh at me ? '' 
`` No , for perhaps he believes in the pineapple compote himself . 
He is very ill now , too , Lise . '' 
`` Yes , he does believe in it , '' said Lise , with flashing eyes . 
`` He does n't despise anyone , '' Alyosha went on . 
`` Only he does not believe anyone . 
If he does n't believe in people , of course , he does despise them . '' 
`` Then he despises me , me ? '' 
`` You , too . '' 
`` Good . '' 
Lise seemed to grind her teeth . 
`` When he went out laughing , I felt that it was nice to be despised . 
The child with fingers cut off is nice , and to be despised is nice ... '' And she laughed in Alyosha 's face , a feverish malicious laugh . 
`` Do you know , Alyosha , do you know , I should like - Alyosha , save me ! '' 
She suddenly jumped from the couch , rushed to him and seized him with both hands . 
`` Save me ! '' 
she almost groaned . 
`` Is there anyone in the world I could tell what I 've told you ? 
I 've told you the truth , the truth . 
I shall kill myself , because I loathe everything ! 
I do n't want to live , because I loathe everything ! 
I loathe everything , everything . 
Alyosha , why do n't you love me in the least ? '' 
she finished in a frenzy . 
`` But I do love you ! '' 
answered Alyosha warmly . 
`` And will you weep over me , will you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Not because I wo n't be your wife , but simply weep for me ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Thank you ! 
It 's only your tears I want . 
Everyone else may punish me and trample me under foot , everyone , everyone , not excepting anyone . 
For I do n't love anyone . 
Do you hear , not anyone ! 
On the contrary , I hate him ! 
Go , Alyosha ; it 's time you went to your brother '' ; she tore herself away from him suddenly . 
`` How can I leave you like this ? '' 
said Alyosha , almost in alarm . 
`` Go to your brother , the prison will be shut ; go , here 's your hat . 
Give my love to Mitya , go , go ! '' 
And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door . 
He looked at her with pained surprise , when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right hand , a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed . 
He glanced at it and instantly read the address , `` To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov . '' 
He looked quickly at Lise . 
Her face had become almost menacing . 
`` Give it to him , you must give it to him ! '' 
she ordered him , trembling and beside herself . 
`` To-day , at once , or I 'll poison myself ! 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
And she slammed the door quickly . 
The bolt clicked . 
Alyosha put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs , without going back to Madame Hohlakov ; forgetting her , in fact .
