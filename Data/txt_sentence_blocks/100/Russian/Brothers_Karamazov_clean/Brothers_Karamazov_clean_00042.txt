He seemed frantic . 
`` But you 've seen for yourself that she has n't come , '' cried Ivan . 
`` But she may have come by that other entrance . '' 
`` You know that entrance is locked , and you have the key . '' 
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room . 
He had , of course , found the other entrance locked , and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's pocket . 
The windows of all rooms were also closed , so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch , as soon as he saw him again . 
`` He 's been stealing money in my bedroom . '' 
And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri . 
But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples , tugged at them , and flung him with a crash on the floor . 
He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face . 
The old man moaned shrilly . 
Ivan , though not so strong as Dmitri , threw his arms round him , and with all his might pulled him away . 
Alyosha helped him with his slender strength , holding Dmitri in front . 
`` Madman ! 
You 've killed him ! '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Serve him right ! '' 
shouted Dmitri breathlessly . 
`` If I have n't killed him , I 'll come again and kill him . 
You ca n't protect him ! '' 
`` Dmitri ! 
Go away at once ! '' 
cried Alyosha commandingly . 
`` Alexey ! 
You tell me . 
It 's only you I can believe ; was she here just now , or not ? 
I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane . 
I shouted , she ran away . '' 
`` I swear she 's not been here , and no one expected her . '' 
`` But I saw her ... . 
So she must ... I 'll find out at once where she is ... . 
Good-bye , Alexey ! 
Not a word to Aesop about the money now . 
But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say , ` He sends his compliments to you ! ' 
Compliments , his compliments ! 
just compliments and farewell ! 
Describe the scene to her . '' 
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an arm-chair . 
His face was covered with blood , but he was conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri 's cries . 
He was still fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house . 
Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he went out . 
`` I do n't repent shedding your blood ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Beware , old man , beware of your dream , for I have my dream , too . 
I curse you , and disown you altogether . '' 
He ran out of the room . 
`` She 's here . 
She must be here . 
Smerdyakov ! 
Smerdyakov ! '' 
the old man wheezed , scarcely audibly , beckoning to him with his finger . 
`` No , she 's not here , you old lunatic ! '' 
Ivan shouted at him angrily . 
`` Here , he 's fainting ? 
Water ! 
A towel ! 
Make haste , Smerdyakov ! '' 
Smerdyakov ran for water . 
At last they got the old man undressed , and put him to bed . 
They wrapped a wet towel round his head . 
Exhausted by the brandy , by his violent emotion , and the blows he had received , he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow . 
Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room . 
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase , while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor . 
`` Should n't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed , too ? '' 
Alyosha said to him . 
`` We 'll look after him . 
My brother gave you a terrible blow - on the head . '' 
`` He 's insulted me ! '' 
Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly . 
`` He 's ` insulted ' his father , not only you , '' observed Ivan with a forced smile . 
`` I used to wash him in his tub . 
He 's insulted me , '' repeated Grigory . 
`` Damn it all , if I had n't pulled him away perhaps he 'd have murdered him . 
It would n't take much to do for Aesop , would it ? '' 
whispered Ivan to Alyosha . 
`` God forbid ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Why should He forbid ? '' 
Ivan went on in the same whisper , with a malignant grimace . 
`` One reptile will devour the other . 
And serve them both right , too . '' 
Alyosha shuddered . 
`` Of course I wo n't let him be murdered as I did n't just now . 
Stay here , Alyosha , I 'll go for a turn in the yard . 
My head 's begun to ache . '' 
Alyosha went to his father 's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour . 
The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha , evidently remembering and meditating . 
All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement . 
`` Alyosha , '' he whispered apprehensively , `` where 's Ivan ? '' 
`` In the yard . 
He 's got a headache . 
He 's on the watch . '' 
`` Give me that looking-glass . 
It stands over there . 
Give it me . '' 
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the chest of drawers . 
The old man looked at himself in it ; his nose was considerably swollen , and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise .
