The children 's faces instantly brightened . 
`` Show us the cannon , '' said Kostya , beaming all over . 
Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel , and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table . 
`` Ah , you are bound to ask that ! 
Look , it 's on wheels . '' 
He rolled the toy on along the table . 
`` And it can be fired off , too . 
It can be loaded with shot and fired off . '' 
`` And it could kill anyone ? '' 
`` It can kill anyone ; you 've only got to aim at anybody , '' and Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put , where the shot should be rolled in , showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole , and told them that it kicked when it was fired . 
The children listened with intense interest . 
What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked . 
`` And have you got any powder ? '' 
Nastya inquired . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Show us the powder , too , '' she drawled with a smile of entreaty . 
Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder . 
He had some shot , too , in a screw of paper . 
He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his hand . 
`` One has to be careful there 's no fire about , or it would blow up and kill us all , '' Krassotkin warned them sensationally . 
The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment . 
But Kostya liked the shot better . 
`` And does the shot burn ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` No , it does n't . '' 
`` Give me a little shot , '' he asked in an imploring voice . 
`` I 'll give you a little shot ; here , take it , but do n't show it to your mother till I come back , or she 'll be sure to think it 's gunpowder , and will die of fright and give you a thrashing . '' 
`` Mother never does whip us , '' Nastya observed at once . 
`` I know , I only said it to finish the sentence . 
And do n't you ever deceive your mother except just this once , until I come back . 
And so , kiddies , can I go out ? 
You wo n't be frightened and cry when I 'm gone ? '' 
`` We sha-all cry , '' drawled Kostya , on the verge of tears already . 
`` We shall cry , we shall be sure to cry , '' Nastya chimed in with timid haste . 
`` Oh , children , children , how fraught with peril are your years ! 
There 's no help for it , chickens ; I shall have to stay with you I do n't know how long . 
And time is passing , time is passing , oogh ! '' 
`` Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead ! '' 
Kostya begged . 
`` There 's no help for it , we must have recourse to Perezvon . 
Ici , Perezvon . '' 
And Kolya began giving orders to the dog , who performed all his tricks . 
He was a rough-haired dog , of medium size , with a coat of a sort of lilac-grey colour . 
He was blind in his right eye , and his left ear was torn . 
He whined and jumped , stood and walked on his hind legs , lay on his back with his paws in the air , rigid as though he were dead . 
While this last performance was going on , the door opened and Agafya , Madame Krassotkin 's servant , a stout woman of forty , marked with small-pox , appeared in the doorway . 
She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand . 
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog . 
Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return , he did not cut short the performance , and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time , at last he whistled to him . 
The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty . 
`` Only think , a dog ! '' 
Agafya observed sententiously . 
`` Why are you late , female ? '' 
asked Krassotkin sternly . 
`` Female , indeed ! 
Go on with you , you brat . '' 
`` Brat ? '' 
`` Yes , a brat . 
What is it to you if I 'm late ; if I 'm late , you may be sure I have good reason , '' muttered Agafya , busying herself about the stove , without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice . 
She seemed quite pleased , in fact , to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master . 
`` Listen , you frivolous young woman , '' Krassotkin began , getting up from the sofa , `` can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides , that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence ? 
I am going out . '' 
`` And what am I going to swear for ? '' 
laughed Agafya . 
`` I shall look after them without that . '' 
`` No , you must swear on your eternal salvation . 
Else I sha n't go . '' 
`` Well , do n't then . 
What does it matter to me ? 
It 's cold out ; stay at home . '' 
`` Kids , '' Kolya turned to the children , `` this woman will stay with you till I come back or till your mother comes , for she ought to have been back long ago . 
She will give you some lunch , too . 
You 'll give them something , Agafya , wo n't you ? '' 
`` That I can do . '' 
`` Good-bye , chickens , I go with my heart at rest . 
And you , granny , '' he added gravely , in an undertone , as he passed Agafya , `` I hope you 'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman 's nonsense about Katerina . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Get along with you ! '' 
retorted Agafya , really angry this time . 
`` Ridiculous boy ! 
You want a whipping for saying such things , that 's what you want ! '' 
The Schoolboy BUT Kolya did not hear her . 
At last he could go out . 
As he went out at the gate he looked round him , shrugged up his shoulders , and saying `` It is freezing , '' went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market-place . 
When he reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at the gate , pulled a whistle out of his pocket , and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal . 
He had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven , wearing a warm , neat and even stylish coat , darted out to meet him . 
This was Smurov , a boy in the preparatory class -LRB- two classes below Kolya Krassotkin -RRB- , son of a well-to-do official . 
Apparently he was forbidden by his parents to associate with Krassotkin , who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy , so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly . 
He was - if the reader has not forgotten one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha . 
He was the one who told Alyosha about Ilusha . 
`` I 've been waiting for you for the last hour , Krassotkin , '' said Smurov stolidly , and the boys strode towards the market-place . 
`` I am late , '' answered Krassotkin . 
`` I was detained by circumstances . 
You wo n't be thrashed for coming with me ? '' 
`` Come , I say , I 'm never thrashed ! 
And you 've got Perezvon with you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You 're taking him , too ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Ah !
