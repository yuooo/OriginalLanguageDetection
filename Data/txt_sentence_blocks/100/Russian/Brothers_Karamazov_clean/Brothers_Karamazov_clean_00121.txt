Here 's your money ... because I am in great need of them ... and I have n't a minute , a minute to spare . '' 
And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` But I sha n't have change enough . 
Have n't you less ? '' 
`` No , '' said Mitya , looking again at the bundle , and as though not trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones . 
`` No , they 're all alike , '' he added , and again he looked inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` How have you grown so rich ? '' 
the latter asked . 
`` Wait , I 'll send my boy to Plotnikov 's , they close late - to see if they wo n't change it . 
Here , Misha ! '' 
he called into the passage . 
`` To Plotnikov 's shop - first-rate ! '' 
cried Mitya , as though struck by an idea . 
`` Misha , '' he turned to the boy as he came in , `` look here , run to Plotnikov 's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings , and will be there directly ... . 
But listen , listen , tell them to have champagne , three dozen bottles , ready before I come , and packed as it was to take to Mokroe . 
I took four dozen with me then , '' he added -LRB- suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch -RRB- ; `` they know all about it , do n't you trouble , Misha , '' he turned again to the boy . 
`` Stay , listen ; tell them to put in cheese , Strasburg pies , smoked fish , ham , caviare , and everything , everything they 've got , up to a hundred roubles , or a hundred and twenty as before ... . 
But wait : do n't let them forget dessert , sweets , pears , watermelons , two or three or four - no , one melon 's enough , and chocolate , candy , toffee , fondants ; in fact , everything I took to Mokroe before , three hundred roubles ' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the same again . 
And remember , Misha , if you are called Misha - His name is Misha , is n't it ? '' 
He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again . 
`` Wait a minute , '' Pyotr Ilyitch intervened listening and watching him uneasily , `` you 'd better go yourself and tell them . 
He 'll muddle it . '' 
`` He will , I see he will ! 
Eh , Misha ! 
Why , I was going to kiss you for the commission ... . 
If you do n't make a mistake , there 's ten roubles for you , run along , make haste ... . 
Champagne 's the chief thing , let them bring up champagne . 
And brandy , too , and red and white wine , and all I had then ... . 
They know what I had then . '' 
`` But listen ! '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience . 
`` I say , let him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close , and you go and tell them ... . 
Give him your note . 
Be off , Misha ! 
Put your best leg forward ! '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose , because the boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open , apparently understanding little of Mitya 's orders , gazing up with amazement and terror at his bloodstained face and the trembling blood-stained fingers that held the notes . 
`` Well , now come and wash , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly . 
`` Put the money on the table or else in your pocket ... . 
That 's right , come along . 
But take off your coat . '' 
And beginning to help him off with his coat , he cried out again : `` Look , your coat 's covered with blood , too ! '' 
`` That ... it 's not the coat . 
It 's only a little here on the sleeve ... . 
And that 's only here where the handkerchief lay . 
It must have soaked through . 
I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya 's , and the blood 's come through , '' Mitya explained at once with a child-like unconsciousness that was astounding . 
Pyotr Ilyitch listened , frowning . 
`` Well , you must have been up to something ; you must have been fighting with someone , '' he muttered . 
They began to wash . 
Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water . 
Mitya , in desperate haste , scarcely soaped his hands -LRB- they were trembling , and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards -RRB- . 
But the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more . 
He seemed to exercise more and more sway over Mitya , as time went on . 
It may be noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character . 
`` Look , you have n't got your nails clean . 
Now rub your face ; here , on your temples , by your ear ... . 
Will you go in that shirt ? 
Where are you going ? 
Look , all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood . '' 
`` Yes , it 's all bloody , '' observed Mitya , looking at the cuff of his shirt . 
`` Then change your shirt . '' 
`` I have n't time . 
You see I 'll ... '' Mitya went on with the same confiding ingenuousness , drying his face and hands on the towel , and putting on his coat . 
`` I 'll turn it up at the wrist . 
It wo n't be seen under the coat ... . 
You see ! '' 
`` Tell me now , what game have you been up to ? 
Have you been fighting with someone ? 
In the tavern again , as before ? 
Have you been beating that captain again ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully . 
`` Whom have you been beating now ... or killing , perhaps ? '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
said Mitya . 
`` Do n't worry , '' said Mitya , and he suddenly laughed . 
`` I smashed an old woman in the market-place just now . '' 
`` Smashed ? 
An old woman ? '' 
`` An old man ! '' 
cried Mitya , looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face , laughing , and shouting at him as though he were deaf . 
`` Confound it ! 
An old woman , an old man ... . 
Have you killed someone ? '' 
`` We made it up . 
We had a row - and made it up . 
In a place I know of . 
We parted friends . 
A fool ... . 
He 's forgiven me ... . 
He 's sure to have forgiven me by now ... if he had got up , he would n't have forgiven me '' - Mitya suddenly winked - `` only damn him , you know , I say , Pyotr Ilyitch , damn him ! 
Do n't worry about him ! 
I do n't want to just now ! '' 
Mitya snapped out , resolutely . 
`` Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with everyone for ? 
... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense ... . 
You 've been fighting and now you 're rushing off on the spree - that 's you all over ! 
Three dozen champagne - what do you want all that for ? '' 
`` Bravo ! 
Now give me the pistols . 
Upon my honour I 've no time now .
