If she were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation , it would be meanness , but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man ... Listen , Alyosha , do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married , and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read them , so you may as well be prepared . '' 
`` Yes , of course , if so - '' muttered Alyosha , `` only it 's not right . '' 
`` Ah , how contemptuous ! 
Alyosha , dear , we wo n't quarrel the very first day . 
I 'd better tell you the whole truth . 
Of course , it 's very wrong to spy on people , and , of course , I am not right and you are , only I shall spy on you all the same . '' 
`` Do , then ; you wo n't find out anything , '' laughed Alyosha . 
`` And Alyosha , will you give in to me ? 
We must decide that too . '' 
`` I shall be delighted to , Lise , and certain to , only not in the most important things . 
Even if you do n't agree with me , I shall do my duty in the most important things . '' 
`` That 's right ; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters , but in everything . 
And I am ready to vow to do so now - in everything , and for all my life ! '' 
cried Lise fervently , `` and I 'll do it gladly , gladly ! 
What 's more , I 'll swear never to spy on you , never once , never to read one of your letters . 
For you are right and I am not . 
And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy , I know that I wo n't do it since you consider it dishonourable . 
You are my conscience now ... . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch , why have you been so sad lately - both yesterday and to-day ? 
I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble , but I see you have some special grief besides , some secret one , perhaps ? '' 
`` Yes , Lise , I have a secret one , too , '' answered Alyosha mournfully . 
`` I see you love me , since you guessed that . '' 
`` What grief ? 
What about ? 
Can you tell me ? '' 
asked Lise with timid entreaty . 
`` I 'll tell you later , Lise - afterwards , '' said Alyosha , confused . 
`` Now you would n't understand it perhaps - and perhaps I could n't explain it . '' 
`` I know your brothers and your father are worrying you , too . '' 
`` Yes , my brothers too , '' murmured Alyosha , pondering . 
`` I do n't like your brother Ivan , Alyosha , '' said Lise suddenly . 
He noticed this remark with some surprise , but did not answer it . 
`` My brothers are destroying themselves , '' he went on , `` my father , too . 
And they are destroying others with them . 
It 's ` the primitive force of the Karamazovs , ' as father Paissy said the other day , a crude , unbridled , earthly force . 
Does the spirit of God move above that force ? 
Even that I do n't know . 
I only know that I , too , am a Karamazov ... . 
Me a monk , a monk ! 
Am I a monk , Lise ? 
You said just now that I was . '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` And perhaps I do n't even believe in God . '' 
`` You do n't believe ? 
What is the matter ? '' 
said Lise quietly and gently . 
But Alyosha did not answer . 
There was something too mysterious , too subjective in these last words of his , perhaps obscure to himself , but yet torturing him . 
`` And now on the top of it all , my friend , the best man in the world is going , is leaving the earth ! 
If you knew , Lise , how bound up in soul I am with him ! 
And then I shall be left alone ... . 
I shall come to you , Lise ... . 
For the future we will be together . '' 
`` Yes , together , together ! 
Henceforward we shall be always together , all our lives ! 
Listen , kiss me , I allow you . '' 
Alyosha kissed her . 
`` Come , now go . 
Christ be with you ! '' 
and she made the sign of the cross over him . 
`` Make haste back to him while he is alive . 
I see I 've kept you cruelly . 
I 'll pray to-day for him and you . 
Alyosha , we shall be happy ! 
Shall we be happy , shall we ? '' 
`` I believe we shall , Lise . '' 
Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good-bye to her . 
But no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him . 
From the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , this is awful . 
This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous . 
I trust you wo n't dream - It 's foolishness , nothing but foolishness ! '' 
she said , attacking him at once . 
`` Only do n't tell her that , '' said Alyosha , `` or she will be upset , and that 's bad for her now . '' 
`` Sensible advice from a sensible young man . 
Am I to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state , because you did n't want to irritate her by contradiction ? '' 
`` Oh no , not at all . 
I was quite serious in what I said , '' Alyosha declared stoutly . 
`` To be serious about it is impossible , unthinkable , and in the first place I shall never be at home to you again , and I shall take her away , you may be sure of that . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` It 's all so far off . 
We may have to wait another year and a half . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that 's true , of course , and you 'll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half . 
But I am so unhappy ! 
Though it 's such nonsense , it 's a great blow to me . 
I feel like Famusov in the last scene of Sorrow from Wit . 
You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya , and , only fancy , I 've run down to meet you on the stairs , and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase . 
I heard it all ; I almost dropped . 
So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late ! 
It means love to the daughter but death to the mother . 
I might as well be in my grave at once . 
And a more serious matter still , what is this letter she has written ? 
Show it me at once , at once ! '' 
`` No , there 's no need . 
Tell me , how is Katerina Ivanovna now ? 
I must know . '' 
`` She still lies in delirium ; she has not regained consciousness . 
Her aunts are here ; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs . 
Herzenstube came , and he was so alarmed that I did n't know what to do for him .
