To Nikolay Parfenovitch 's direct question , had he noticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand , as he must have been able to see the sum better than anyone when he took the note from him , Maximov , in the most positive manner , declared that there was twenty thousand . 
`` Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before , then ? '' 
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch , with a smile . 
`` To be sure I have , not twenty , but seven , when my wife mortgaged my little property . 
She 'd only let me look at it from a distance , boasting of it to me . 
It was a very thick bundle , all rainbow-coloured notes . 
And Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's were all rainbow-coloured ... '' He was not kept long . 
At last it was Grushenka 's turn . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might have on Mitya , and he muttered a few words of admonition to him , but Mitya bowed his head in silence , giving him to understand `` that he would not make a scene . '' 
Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in . 
She entered with a stern and gloomy face , that looked almost composed , and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
She was very pale , she seemed to be cold , and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl . 
She was suffering from a slight feverish chill - the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night . 
Her grave air , her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favourable impression on everyone . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit `` fascinated . '' 
He admitted himself , when talking about it afterwards , that only then had he seen `` how handsome the woman was , '' for , though he had seen her several times he had always looked upon her as something of a `` provincial hetaira . '' 
`` She has the manners of the best society , '' he said enthusiastically , gossiping about her in a circle of ladies . 
But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies , who immediately called him a `` naughty man , '' to his great satisfaction . 
As she entered the room , Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya , who looked at her uneasily . 
But her face reassured him at once . 
After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings , Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her , hesitating a little , but preserving the most courteous manner , on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied : `` He was an acquaintance . 
He came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month . '' 
To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness , that , though `` at times '' she had thought him attractive , she had not loved him , but had won his heart as well as his old father 's `` in my nasty spite , '' that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and everyone else ; but that had only amused her . 
She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch , she had simply been laughing at him . 
`` I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month . 
I was expecting another man who had wronged me . 
But I think , '' she said in conclusion , `` that there 's no need for you to inquire about that , nor for me to answer you , for that 's my own affair . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint . 
He again dismissed the `` romantic '' aspect of the case and passed to the serious one , that is , to the question of most importance , concerning the three thousand roubles . 
Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe , and , though she had not counted the money herself , she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's own lips . 
`` Did he tell you that alone , or before someone else , or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence ? '' 
the prosecutor inquired immediately . 
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people , and had heard him say so when they were alone . 
`` Did he say it to you alone once , or several times ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor , and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence . 
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew , too , where that money had come from , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` And did you never , once , hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand , but less , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use ? '' 
`` No , I never heard that , '' answered Grushenka . 
It was explained further that Mitya had , on the contrary , often told her that he had n't a farthing . 
`` He was always expecting to get some from his father , '' said Grushenka in conclusion . 
`` Did he never say before you ... casually , or in a moment of irritation , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly , `` that he intended to make an attempt on his father 's life ? '' 
`` Ach , he did say so , '' sighed Grushenka . 
`` Once or several times ? '' 
`` He mentioned it several times , always in anger . '' 
`` And did you believe he would do it ? '' 
`` No , I never believed it , '' she answered firmly . 
`` I had faith in his noble heart . '' 
`` Gentlemen , allow me , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna , in your presence . '' 
`` You can speak , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch assented . 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ! '' 
Mitya got up from his chair , `` have faith in God and in me . 
I am not guilty of my father 's murder ! '' 
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair . 
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon . 
`` Thanks be to Thee , O Lord , '' she said , in a voice thrilled with emotion , and still standing , she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added : `` As he has spoken now , believe it ! 
I know him . 
He 'll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy , but he 'll never deceive you against his conscience . 
He 's telling the whole truth , you may believe it . '' 
`` Thanks , Agrafena Alexandrovna , you 've given me fresh courage , '' Mitya responded in a quivering voice . 
As to the money spent the previous day , she declared that she did not know what sum it was , but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him . 
And to the question where he got the money , she said that he had told her that he had `` stolen '' it from Katerina Ivanovna , and that she had replied to that that he had n't stolen it , and that he must pay the money back next day . 
On the prosecutor 's asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday , or what he had squandered here a month ago , she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago , and that that was how she understood him . 
Grushenka was at last released , and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could be of any assistance to her , with horses for example , or if she would care for an escort , he ... would be - `` I thank you sincerely , '' said Grushenka , bowing to him , `` I 'm going with this old gentleman ; I am driving him back to town with me , and meanwhile , if you 'll allow me , I 'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
She went out . 
Mitya was calm , and even looked more cheerful , but only for a moment . 
He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness . 
His eyes were closing with fatigue . 
The examination of the witnesses was , at last , over . 
They procceded to a revision of the protocol . 
Mitya got up , moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain , lay down on a large chest covered with a rug , and instantly fell asleep . 
He had a strange dream , utterly out of keeping with the place and the time . 
He was driving somewhere in the steppes , where he had been stationed long ago , and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses , through snow and sleet . 
He was cold , it was early in November , and the snow was falling in big wet flakes , melting as soon as it touched the earth . 
And the peasant drove him smartly , he had a fair , long beard . 
He was not an old man , somewhere about fifty , and he had on a grey peasant 's smock . 
Not far off was a village , he could see the black huts , and half the huts were burnt down , there were only the charred beams sticking up . 
And as they drove in , there were peasant women drawn up along the road , a lot of women , a whole row , all thin and wan , with their faces a sort of brownish colour , especially one at the edge , a tall , bony woman , who looked forty , but might have been only twenty , with a long thin face . 
And in her arms was a little baby crying . 
And her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them . 
And the child cried and cried , and held out its little bare arms , with its little fists blue from cold . 
`` Why are they crying ? 
Why are they crying ? '' 
Mitya asked , as they dashed gaily by . 
`` It 's the babe , '' answered the driver , `` the babe weeping . '' 
And Mitya was struck by his saying , in his peasant way , `` the babe , '' and he liked the peasant 's calling it a `` babe . '' 
There seemed more pity in it . 
`` But why is it weeping ? '' 
Mitya persisted stupidly , `` why are its little arms bare ? 
Why do n't they wrap it up ? '' 
`` The babe 's cold , its little clothes are frozen and do n't warm it . '' 
`` But why is it ? 
Why ? '' 
foolish Mitya still persisted . 
`` Why , they 're poor people , burnt out . 
They 've no bread . 
They 're begging because they 've been burnt out . '' 
`` No , no , '' Mitya , as it were , still did not understand . 
`` Tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there ?
