Alyosha flushed , and faint , imperceptible shivers kept running down him . 
`` You make so much of me , dear young lady , and perhaps I am not at all worthy of your kindness . '' 
`` Not worthy ! 
She 's not worthy of it ! '' 
Katerina Ivanovna cried again with the same warmth . 
`` You know , Alexey Fyodorovitch , we 're fanciful , we 're self-willed , but proudest of the proud in our little heart . 
We 're noble , we 're generous , Alexey Fyodorovitch , let me tell you . 
We have only been unfortunate . 
We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy , perhaps , or fickle man . 
There was one man - one , an officer too , we loved him , we sacrificed everything to him . 
That was long ago , five years ago , and he has forgotten us , he has married . 
Now he is a widower , he has written , he is coming here , and , do you know , we 've loved him , none but him , all this time , and we 've loved him all our life ! 
He will come , and Grushenka will be happy again . 
For the last five years she 's been wretched . 
But who can reproach her , who can boast of her favour ? 
Only that bedridden old merchant , but he is more like her father , her friend , her protector . 
He found her then in despair , in agony , deserted by the man she loved . 
She was ready to drown herself then , but the old merchant saved her - saved her ! '' 
`` You defend me very kindly , dear young lady . 
You are in a great hurry about everything , '' Grushenka drawled again . 
`` Defend you ! 
Is it for me to defend you ? 
Should I dare to defend you ? 
Grushenka , angel , give me your hand . 
Look at that charming soft little hand , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
Look at it ! 
It has brought me happiness and has lifted me up , and I 'm going to kiss it , outside and inside , here , here , here ! '' 
And three times she kissed the certainly charming , though rather fat , hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture . 
She held out her hand with a charming musical , nervous little laugh , watched the `` sweet young lady , '' and obviously liked having her hand kissed . 
`` Perhaps there 's rather too much rapture , '' thought Alyosha . 
He blushed . 
He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time . 
`` You wo n't make me blush , dear young lady , kissing my hand like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Do you think I meant to make you blush ? '' 
said Katerina Ivanovna , somewhat surprised . 
`` Ah my dear , how little you understand me ! 
`` Yes , and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me , dear young lady . 
Maybe I 'm not so good as I seem to you . 
I 've a bad heart ; I will have my own way . 
I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun . '' 
`` But now you 'll save him . 
You 've given me your word . 
You 'll explain it all to him . 
You 'll break to him that you have long loved another man , who is now offering you his hand . '' 
`` Oh , no I did n't give you my word to do that . 
It was you kept talking about that . 
I did n't give you my word . '' 
`` Then I did n't quite understand you , '' said Katerina Ivanovna slowly , turning a little pale . 
`` You promised - '' `` Oh no , angel lady , I 've promised nothing , '' Grushenka interrupted softly and evenly , still with the same gay and simple expression . 
`` You see at once , dear young lady , what a wilful wretch I am compared with you . 
If I want to do a thing I do it . 
I may have made you some promise just now . 
But now again I 'm thinking : I may take Mitya again . 
I liked him very much once - liked him for almost a whole hour . 
Now maybe I shall go and tell him to stay with me from this day forward . 
You see , I 'm so changeable . '' 
`` Just now you said - something quite different , '' Katerina Ivanovna whispered faintly . 
`` Ah , just now ! 
But , you know , I 'm such a soft-hearted , silly creature . 
Only think what he 's gone through on my account ! 
What if when I go home I feel sorry for him ? 
What then ? '' 
`` I never expected - '' `` Ah , young lady , how good and generous you are compared with me ! 
Now perhaps you wo n't care for a silly creature like me , now you know my character . 
Give me your sweet little hand , angelic lady , '' she said tenderly , and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna 's hand . 
`` Here , dear young lady , I 'll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine . 
You kissed mine three times , but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times to be even with you . 
Well , but let that pass . 
And then it shall be as God wills . 
Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave . 
Let it be as God wills , without any agreements and promises . 
What a sweet hand - what a sweet hand you have ! 
You sweet young lady , you incredible beauty ! '' 
She slowly raised the hands to her lips , with the strange object indeed of `` being even '' with her in kisses . 
Katerina Ivanovna did not take her hand away . 
She listened with timid hope to the last words , though Grushenka 's promise to do her bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed . 
She looked intently into her eyes ; she still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted , confiding expression , the same bright gaiety . 
`` She 's perhaps too naive , '' thought Katerina Ivanovna , with a gleam of hope . 
Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the `` sweet hand . '' 
She raised it deliberately to her lips . 
But she held it for two or three minutes near her lips , as though reconsidering something . 
`` Do you know , angel lady , '' she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice , `` do you know , after all , I think I wo n't kiss your hand ? '' 
And she laughed a little merry laugh . 
`` As you please . 
What 's the matter with you ? '' 
said Katerina Ivanovna , starting suddenly . 
`` So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand , but I did n't kiss yours . '' 
There was a sudden gleam in her eyes . 
She looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Insolent creature ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , as though suddenly grasping something . 
She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat . 
Grushenka too got up , but without haste . 
`` So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand , but I did n't kiss yours at all . 
And how he will laugh ! '' 
`` Vile slut ! 
Go away ! '' 
`` Ah , for shame , young lady ! 
Ah , for shame ! 
That 's unbecoming for you , dear young lady , a word like that . ''
