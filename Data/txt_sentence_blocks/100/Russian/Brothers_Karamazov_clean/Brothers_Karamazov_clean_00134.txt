`` This is a mortal insult ! '' 
The little Pole turned as red as a crab , and he went out of the room , briskly , as though unwilling to hear another word . 
Vrublevsky swung out after him , and Mitya followed , confused and crestfallen . 
He was afraid of Grushenka , afraid that the Pan would at once raise an outcry . 
And so indeed he did . 
The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka . 
`` Pani Agrippina , I have received a mortal insult ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience , as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot . 
`` Speak Russian ! 
Speak Russian ! '' 
she cried , `` not another word of Polish ! 
You used to talk Russian . 
You ca n't have forgotten it in five years . '' 
She was red with passion . 
`` Pani Agrippina - '' `` My name 's Agrafena , Grushenka , speak Russian or I wo n't listen ! '' 
The Pole gasped with offended dignity , and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian : `` Pani Agrafena , I came here to forget the past and forgive it , to forget all that has happened till to-day - '' `` Forgive ? 
Came here to forgive me ? '' 
Grushenka cut him short , jumping up from her seat . 
`` Just so , Pani , I 'm not pusillanimous , I 'm magnanimous . 
But I was astounded when I saw your lovers . 
Pan Mitya offered me three thousand , in the other room to depart . 
I spat in the pan 's face . '' 
`` What ? 
He offered you money for me ? '' 
cried Grushenka , hysterically . 
`` Is it true , Mitya ? 
How dare you ? 
Am I for sale ? '' 
`` Panie , panie ! '' 
yelled Mitya , `` she 's pure and shining , and I have never been her lover ! 
That 's a lie ... '' `` How dare you defend me to him ? '' 
shrieked Grushenka . 
`` It was n't virtue kept me pure , and it was n't that I was afraid of Kuzma , but that I might hold up my head when I met him , and tell him he 's a scoundrel . 
And he did actually refuse the money ? '' 
`` He took it ! 
He took it ! '' 
cried Mitya ; `` only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once , and I could only give him seven hundred straight off . '' 
`` I see : he heard I had money , and came here to marry me ! '' 
`` Pani Agrippina ! '' 
cried the little Pole . 
`` I 'm - a knight , I 'm - a nobleman , and not a lajdak . 
I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman , perverse and shameless . '' 
`` Oh , go back where you came from ! 
I 'll tell them to turn you out and you 'll be turned out , '' cried Grushenka , furious . 
`` I 've been a fool , a fool , to have been miserable these five years ! 
And it was n't for his sake , it was my anger made me miserable . 
And this is n't he at all ! 
Was he like this ? 
It might be his father ! 
Where did you get your wig from ? 
He was a falcon , but this is a gander . 
He used to laugh and sing to me ... . 
And I 've been crying for five years , damned fool , abject , shameless I was ! 
She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands . 
At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left - a rollicking dance song . 
`` A regular Sodom ! '' 
Vrublevsky roared suddenly . 
`` Landlord , send the shameless hussies away ! '' 
The landlord , who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door , hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarrelling , at once entered the room . 
`` What are you shouting for ? 
D'you want to split your throat ? '' 
he said , addressing Vrublevsky , with surprising rudeness . 
`` Animal ! '' 
bellowed Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Animal ? 
And what sort of cards were you playing with just now ? 
I gave you a pack and you hid it . 
You played with marked cards ! 
I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards , d'you know that , for it 's just the same as false banknotes ... And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion , and pulled out an unopened pack of cards . 
`` Here 's my pack unopened ! '' 
He held it up and showed it to all in the room . 
`` From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away , and put his in place of it - you 're a cheat and not a gentleman ! '' 
`` And I twice saw the pan change a card ! '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` How shameful ! 
How shameful ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , clasping her hands , and blushing for genuine shame . 
`` Good Lord , he 's come to that ! '' 
`` I thought so , too ! '' 
said Mitya . 
But before he had uttered the words , Vrublevsky , with a confused and infuriated face , shook his fist at Grushenka , shouting : `` You low harlot ! '' 
Mitya flew at him at once , clutched him in both hands , lifted him in the air , and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right , from which they had just come . 
`` I 've laid him on the floor , there , '' he announced , returning at once , gasping with excitement . 
`` He 's struggling , the scoundrel ! 
But he wo n't come back , no fear of that ! 
... '' He closed one half of the folding doors , and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole : `` Most illustrious , will you please to retire as well ? '' 
`` My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' said Trifon Borissovitch , `` make them give you back the money you lost . 
It 's as good as stolen from you . '' 
`` I do n't want my fifty roubles back , '' Kalgonov declared suddenly . 
`` I do n't want my two hundred , either , '' cried Mitya , `` I would n't take it for anything ! 
Let him keep it as a consolation . '' 
`` Bravo , Mitya ! 
You 're a trump , Mitya ! '' 
cried Grushenka , and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation . 
The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity , was making for the door , but he stopped short and said suddenly , addressing Grushenka : `` Pani , if you want to come with me , come . 
If not , good-bye . '' 
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door . 
This was a man of character : he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed , he still expected that she would marry him . 
Mitya slammed the door after him .
