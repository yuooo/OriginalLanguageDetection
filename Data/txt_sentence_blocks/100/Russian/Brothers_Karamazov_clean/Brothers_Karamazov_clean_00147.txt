Your question has no bearing on the case , and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair . 
I wanted to pay a debt . 
I wanted to pay a debt of honour but to whom I wo n't say . '' 
`` Allow me to make a note of that , '' said the prosecutor . 
`` By all means . 
Write down that I wo n't say , that I wo n't . 
Write that I should think it dishonourable to say . 
Ech ! 
you can write it ; you 've nothing else to do with your time . '' 
`` Allow me to caution you , sir , and to remind you once more , if you are unaware of it , '' the prosecutor began , with a peculiar and stern impressiveness , `` that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions put to you now , and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from you , if you decline to give it for one reason or another . 
That is entirely a matter for your personal decision . 
But it is our duty , on the other hand , in such cases as the present , to explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence . 
After which I will beg you to continue . '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'm not angry ... I. . . 
`` Mitya muttered in a rather disconcerted tone . 
`` Well , gentlemen , you see , that Samsonov to whom I went then ... '' We will , of course , not reproduce his account of what is known to the reader already . 
Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest detail . 
At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over . 
But as he gave his evidence it was written down , and therefore they had continually to pull him up . 
Mitya disliked this , but submitted ; got angry , though still good-humouredly . 
He did , it is true , exclaim , from time to time , `` Gentlemen , that 's enough to make an angel out of patience ! '' 
Or , `` Gentlemen , it 's no good your irritating me . '' 
But even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially expansive mood . 
So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two days before . 
-LRB- He had completely realised by now that he had been fooled . -RRB- 
The sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers . 
They were at once greatly interested , and even , to Mitya 's intense indignation , thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time . 
Little by little Mitya began to grow surly . 
Then , after describing his journey to see Lyagavy , the night spent in the stifling hut , and so on , he came to his return to the town . 
Here he began , without being particularly urged , to give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on Grushenka 's account . 
He was heard with silent attention . 
They inquired particularly into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna 's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's garden to keep watch on Grushenka , and of Smerdyakov 's bringing him information . 
They laid particular stress on this , and noted it down . 
Of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length , and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feelings to `` public ignominy , '' so to speak , he evidently overcame his shame in order to tell the truth . 
The frigid severity with which the investigating lawyer , and still more the prosecutor , stared intently at him as he told his story , disconcerted him at last considerably . 
`` That boy , Nikolay Parfenovitch , to whom I was talking nonsense about women only a few days ago , and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my telling this to , '' he reflected mournfully . 
`` It 's ignominious . 
` Be patient , humble , hold thy peace . ' '' 
He wound up his reflections with that line . 
But he pulled himself together to go on again . 
When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov , he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case . 
But the investigating lawyer stopped him , and civilly suggested that he should pass on to `` more essential matters . '' 
At last , when he described his despair and told them how , when he left Madame Hohlakov 's , he thought that he 'd `` get three thousand if he had to murder someone to do it , '' they stopped him again and noted down that he had `` meant to murder someone . '' 
Mitya let them write it without protest . 
At last he reached the point in his story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov 's as soon as he left her there , though she had said that she would stay there till midnight . 
`` If I did n't kill Fenya then , gentlemen , it was only because I had n't time , '' broke from him suddenly at that point in his story . 
That , too , was carefully written down . 
Mitya waited gloomily , and was beginning to tell how he ran into his father 's garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him , and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass pestle . 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
he asked , showing it to Mitya . 
`` Oh , yes , '' he laughed gloomily . 
`` Of course , I recognise it . 
Let me have a look at it ... . 
Damn it , never mind ! '' 
`` You have forgotten to mention it , '' observed the investigating lawyer . 
`` Hang it all , I should n't have concealed it from you . 
Do you suppose I could have managed without it ? 
It simply escaped my memory . '' 
`` Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it . '' 
`` Certainly I will be so good , gentlemen . '' 
And Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran . 
`` But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon ? '' 
`` What object ? 
No object . 
I just picked it up and ran off . '' 
`` What for , if you had no object ? '' 
Mitya 's wrath flared up . 
He looked intently at `` the boy '' and smiled gloomily and malignantly . 
He was feeling more and more ashamed at having told `` such people '' the story of his jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously . 
`` Bother the pestle ! '' 
broke from him suddenly . 
`` But still - '' `` Oh , to keep off dogs ... Oh , because it was dark ... . 
In case anything turned up . '' 
`` But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out , since you 're afraid of the dark ? '' 
`` Ugh ! 
damn it all , gentlemen ! 
There 's positively no talking to you ! '' 
cried Mitya , exasperated beyond endurance , and turning to the secretary , crimson with anger , he said quickly , with a note of fury in his voice : `` Write down at once ... at once ... ` that I snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head with it ! ' 
Well , now are you satisfied , gentlemen ? 
Are your minds relieved ? '' 
he said , glaring defiantly at the lawyers . 
`` We quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you , which you consider trivial , though they are , in fact , essential , '' the prosecutor remarked drily in reply . 
`` Well , upon my word , gentlemen ! 
Yes , I took the pestle ... . 
What does one pick things up for at such moments ? 
I do n't know what for . 
I snatched it up and ran - that 's all . 
For to me , gentlemen , passons , or I declare I wo n't tell you any more . '' 
He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand . 
He sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall , struggling against a feeling of nausea . 
He had , in fact , an awful inclination to get up and declare that he would n't say another word , `` not if you hang me for it . '' 
`` You see , gentlemen , '' he said at last , with difficulty controlling himself , `` you see . 
I listen to you and am haunted by a dream ... . 
It 's a dream I have sometimes , you know ... . 
I often dream it - it 's always the same ... that someone is hunting me , someone I 'm awfully afraid of ... that he 's hunting me in the dark , in the night ... tracking me , and I hide somewhere from him , behind a door or cupboard , hide in a degrading way , and the worst of it is , he always knows where I am , but he pretends not to know where I am on purpose , to prolong my agony , to enjoy my terror ... . 
That 's just what you 're doing now . 
It 's just like that ! '' 
`` Is that the sort of thing you dream about ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor . 
`` Yes , it is .
