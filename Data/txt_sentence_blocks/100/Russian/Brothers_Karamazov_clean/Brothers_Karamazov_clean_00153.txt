Luckily he had them all in his trunk . 
You can keep your own socks and underclothes . '' 
Mitya flew into a passion . 
`` I wo n't have other people 's clothes ! '' 
he shouted menacingly , `` give me my own ! '' 
`` It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Give me my own . 
Damn Kalganov and his clothes , too ! '' 
It was a long time before they could persuade him . 
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down . 
They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled . 
`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before . 
He had an absurd nightmarish feeling , as though he were out of his mind . 
`` Well , what now ? 
Are you going to flog me ? 
That 's all that 's left for you , '' he said , clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor . 
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though he disdained to speak to him . 
`` He looked too closely at my socks , and turned them inside out on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were - the scoundrel ! '' 
`` Well , now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though in reply to Mitya 's question . 
`` Yes , '' said the prosecutor thoughtfully , as though reflecting on something . 
`` We 've done what we could in your interest , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on , `` but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you , we are , at the present moment - '' `` What is the stone in your ring ? '' 
Mitya interrupted suddenly , as though awakening from a reverie . 
He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it ! 
... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night ! 
... And should I have been like this on this night , and at this moment , sitting with you , could I have talked like this , could I have moved like this , could I have looked at you and at the world like this , if I had really been the murderer of my father , when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night - not from fear - oh , not simply from fear of your punishment ! 
The disgrace of it ! 
And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you , who see nothing and believe in nothing , blind moles and scoffers , and to tell you another nasty thing I 've done , another disgrace , even if that would save me from your accusation ! 
No , better Siberia ! 
The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door , he killed him , he robbed him . 
Who was he ? 
I 'm racking my brains and ca n't think who . 
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov , and that 's all I can tell you , and that 's enough , enough , leave me alone ... . 
Exile me , punish me , but do n't bother me any more . 
I 'll say no more . 
Call your witnesses ! '' 
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future . 
The prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking , observed , as though it were the most ordinary thing , with the most frigid and composed air : `` Oh , about the open door of which you spoke just now , we may as well inform you , by the way , now , of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us , that has been given us by Grigory , the old man you wounded . 
On his recovery , he clearly and emphatically stated , in reply to our questions , that when , on coming out to the steps , and hearing a noise in the garden , he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open , before he noticed you running , as you have told us already , in the dark from the open window where you saw your father , he , Grigory , glanced to the left , and , while noticing the open window , observed at the same time , much nearer to him , the door , standing wide open - that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden . 
I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door , though , of course , he did not see you do so with his own eyes , since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden , running towards the fence . '' 
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he yelled , in a sudden frenzy , `` it 's a barefaced lie . 
He could n't have seen the door open because it was shut . 
He 's lying ! '' 
`` I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement . 
He does not waver . 
He adheres to it . 
We 've cross-examined him several times . '' 
`` Precisely . 
I have cross-examined him several times , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly . 
`` It 's false , false ! 
It 's either an attempt to slander me , or the hallucination of a madman , '' Mitya still shouted . 
`` He 's simply raving , from loss of blood , from the wound . 
He must have fancied it when he came to ... . 
He 's raving . '' 
`` Yes , but he noticed the open door , not when he came to after his injuries , but before that , as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge . '' 
`` But it 's false , it 's false ! 
It ca n't be so ! 
He 's slandering me from spite ... . 
He could n't have seen it ... I did n't come from the door , '' gasped Mitya . 
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him impressively : `` Confront him with it . '' 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope , on which three seals still remained intact . 
The envelope was empty , and slit open at one end . 
Mitya stared at it with open eyes . 
`` It ... it must be that envelope of my father 's , the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there 's inscribed on it , allow me , ` For my little chicken ' ... yes - three thousand ! '' 
he shouted , `` do you see , three thousand , do you see ? '' 
`` Of course , we see . 
But we did n't find the money in it .
