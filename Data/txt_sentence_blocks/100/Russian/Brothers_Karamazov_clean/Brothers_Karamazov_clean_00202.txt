Ivan gazed at him , and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror . 
`` He 's mad ! '' 
he cried , and rapidly jumping up , he drew back , so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it , stiff and straight . 
He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov , who , entirely unaffected by his terror , continued fumbling in his stocking , as though he were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull it out . 
At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out . 
Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper , or perhaps a roll of papers . 
Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table . 
`` Here , '' he said quietly . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Ivan , trembling . 
`` Kindly look at it , '' Smerdyakov answered , still in the same low tone . 
Ivan stepped up to the table , took up the roll of paper and began unfolding it , but suddenly drew back his fingers , as though from contact with a loathsome reptile . 
`` Your hands keep twitching , '' observed Smerdyakov , and he deliberately unfolded the bundle himself . 
Under the wrapper were three packets of hundred-rouble notes . 
`` They are all here , all the three thousand roubles ; you need not count them . 
Take them , '' Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan , nodding at the notes . 
Ivan sank back in his chair . 
He was as white as a handkerchief . 
`` You frightened me ... with your stocking , '' he said , with a strange grin . 
`` Can you really not have known till now ? '' 
Smerdyakov asked once more . 
`` No , I did not know . 
I kept thinking of Dmitri . 
Brother , brother ! 
Ach ! '' 
He suddenly clutched his head in both hands . 
`` Listen . 
Did you kill him alone ? 
With my brother 's help or without ? '' 
`` It was only with you , with your help , I killed him , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch is quite innocent . '' 
`` All right , all right . 
Talk about me later . 
Why do I keep on trembling ? 
I ca n't speak properly . '' 
`` You were bold enough then . 
You said ` everything was lawful , ' and how frightened you are now , '' Smerdyakov muttered in surprise . 
`` Wo n't you have some lemonade ? 
I 'll ask for some at once . 
It 's very refreshing . 
Only I must hide this first . '' 
And again he motioned at the notes . 
He was just going to get up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them , but , looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see them , he first took out his handkerchief , and as it turned out to be very dirty , took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table , and put it over the notes . 
The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian . 
Ivan read it mechanically . 
`` I wo n't have any lemonade , '' he said . 
`` Talk of me later . 
Sit down and tell me how you did it . 
Tell me all about it . '' 
`` You 'd better take off your greatcoat , or you 'll be too hot . '' 
Ivan , as though he 'd only just thought of it , took off his coat , and , without getting up from his chair , threw it on the bench . 
`` Speak , please , speak . '' 
He seemed calmer . 
He waited , feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell him all about it . 
`` How it was done ? '' 
sighed Smerdyakov . 
`` It was done in a most natural way , following your very words . '' 
`` Of my words later , '' Ivan broke in again , apparently with complete self-possession , firmly uttering his words , and not shouting as before . 
`` Only tell me in detail how you did it . 
Everything , as it happened . 
Do n't forget anything . 
The details , above everything , the details , I beg you . '' 
`` You 'd gone away , then I fell into the cellar . '' 
`` In a fit or in a sham one ? '' 
`` A sham one , naturally . 
I shammed it all . 
I went quietly down the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly , and as I lay down I gave a scream , and struggled , till they carried me out . '' 
`` Stay ! 
And were you shamming all along , afterwards , and in the hospital ? '' 
`` No , not at all . 
Next day , in the morning , before they took me to the hospital , I had a real attack and a more violent one than I 've had for years . 
For two days I was quite unconscious . '' 
`` All right , all right . 
Go on . '' 
`` They laid me on the bed . 
I knew I 'd be the other side of the partition , for whenever I was ill , Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there , near them . 
She 's always been very kind to me , from my birth up . 
At night I moaned , but quietly . 
I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come . '' 
`` Expecting him ? 
To come to you ? '' 
`` Not to me . 
I expected him to come into the house , for I 'd no doubt that he 'd come that night , for being without me and getting no news , he 'd be sure to come and climb over the fence , as he used to , and do something . '' 
`` And if he had n't come ? '' 
`` Then nothing would have happened . 
I should never have brought myself to it without him . '' 
`` All right , all right . 
speak more intelligibly , do n't hurry ; above all , do n't leave anything out ! '' 
`` I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
I thought that was certain , for I had prepared him for it ... during the last few days ... . 
He knew about the knocks , that was the chief thing . 
With his suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in him all those days , he was bound to get into the house by means of those taps . 
That was inevitable , so I was expecting him . '' 
`` Stay , '' Ivan interrupted ; `` if he had killed him , he would have taken the money and carried it away ; you must have considered that . 
What would you have got by it afterwards ? 
I do n't see . '' 
0 `` But he would never have found the money . 
That was only what I told him , that the money was under the mattress . 
But that was n't true . 
It had been lying in a box . 
And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch , as I was the only person he trusted , to hide the envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons , for no one would have guessed that place , especially if they came in a hurry .
