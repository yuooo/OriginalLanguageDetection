`` As to yesterday , I believe you , but as for to-day , it is difficult to agree with your opinion , '' said he . 
`` Bravo , '' I cried , clapping my hands . 
`` I agree with you there too , I have deserved it ! '' 
`` Will you shoot , sir , or not ? '' 
`` No , I wo n't , '' I said ; `` if you like , fire at me again , but it would be better for you not to fire . '' 
The seconds , especially mine , were shouting too : `` Can you disgrace the regiment like this , facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness ! 
If I 'd only known this ! '' 
I stood facing them all , not laughing now . 
`` Gentlemen , '' I said , `` is it really so wonderful in these days to find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing ? '' 
`` But not in a duel , '' cried my second again . 
`` That 's what 's so strange , '' I said . 
`` For I ought to have owned my fault as soon as I got here , before he had fired a shot , before leading him into a great and deadly sin ; but we have made our life so grotesque , that to act in that way would have been almost impossible , for only after I had faced his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my words have any significance for him , and if I had spoken before , he would have said , ` He is a coward , the sight of the pistols has frightened him , no use to listen to him . ' 
Gentlemen , '' I cried suddenly , speaking straight from my heart , `` look around you at the gifts of God , the clear sky , the pure air , the tender grass , the birds ; nature is beautiful and sinless , and we , only we , are sinful and foolish , and we do n't understand that life is heaven , for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty , we shall embrace each other and weep . '' 
I would have said more but I could not ; my voice broke with the sweetness and youthful gladness of it , and there was such bliss in my heart as I had never known before in my life . 
`` All this is rational and edifying , '' said my antagonist , `` and in any case you are an original person . '' 
`` You may laugh , '' I said to him , laughing too , `` but afterwards you will approve of me . '' 
`` Oh , I am ready to approve of you now , '' said he ; `` will you shake hands ? 
for I believe you are genuinely sincere . '' 
`` No , '' I said , `` not now , later on when I have grown worthier and deserve your esteem , then shake hands and you will do well . '' 
We went home , my second upbraiding me all the way , while I kissed him . 
All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day . 
`` He has disgraced the uniform , '' they said ; `` Let him resign his commission . '' 
Some stood up for me : `` He faced the shot , '' they said . 
`` Yes , but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness . '' 
`` If he had been afraid of being shot , he would have shot his own pistol first before asking forgiveness , while he flung it loaded into the forest . 
No , there 's something else in this , something original . '' 
I enjoyed listening and looking at them . 
`` My dear friends and comrades , '' said I , `` do n't worry about my resigning my commission , for I have done so already . 
I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery - it 's with that object I am leaving the regiment . '' 
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing . 
`` You should have told us of that first , that explains everything , we ca n't judge a monk . '' 
They laughed and could not stop themselves , and not scornfully , but kindly and merrily . 
They all felt friendly to me at once , even those who had been sternest in their censure , and all the following month , before my discharge came , they could not make enough of me . 
`` Ah , you monk , '' they would say . 
And everyone said something kind to me , they began trying to dissuade me , even to pity me : `` What are you doing to yourself ? '' 
`` No , '' they would say , `` he is a brave fellow , he faced fire and could have fired his own pistol too , but he had a dream the night before that he should become a monk , that 's why he did it . '' 
It was the same thing with the society of the town . 
Till then I had been kindly received , but had not been the object of special attention , and now all came to know me at once and invited me ; they laughed at me , but they loved me . 
I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel , the authorities took no notice of it , because my antagonist was a near relation of our general , and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences , and as I resigned my commission , they took it as a joke . 
And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly , regardless of their laughter , for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter . 
These conversations mostly took place in the evenings , in the company of ladies ; women particularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen . 
`` But how can I possibly be responsible for all ? '' 
everyone would laugh in my face . 
`` Can I , for instance , be responsible for you ? '' 
`` You may well not know it , '' I would answer , `` since the whole world has long been going on a different line , since we consider the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others . 
Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and , well , you all look upon me as a madman . 
Though you are friendly to me , yet , you see , you all laugh at me . '' 
`` But how can we help being friendly to you ? '' 
said my hostess , laughing . 
The room was full of people . 
All of a sudden the young lady rose , on whose account the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to be my future wife . 
I had not noticed her coming into the room . 
She got up , came to me and held out her hand . 
`` Let me tell you , '' she said , `` that I am the first not to laugh at you , but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you for your action then . '' 
Her husband , too , came up and then they all approached me and almost kissed me . 
My heart was filled with joy , but my attention was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others . 
I knew him by name already , but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening . 
-LRB- d -RRB- The Mysterious Visitor . 
He had long been an official in the town ; he was in a prominent position , respected by all , rich and had a reputation for benevolence . 
He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum ; he was very charitable , too , in secret , a fact which only became known after his death . 
He was a man of about fifty , almost stern in appearance and not much given to conversation . 
He had been married about ten years and his wife , who was still young , had borne him three children . 
Well , I was sitting alone in my room the following evening , when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in . 
I must mention , by the way , that I was no longer living in my former quarters . 
As soon as I resigned my commission , I took rooms with an old lady , the widow of a government clerk . 
My landlady 's servant waited upon me , for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment , as I felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last interview with him . 
So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed of any righteous action . 
`` I have , '' said my visitor , `` with great interest listened to you speaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to make your personal acquaintance , so as to talk to you more intimately . 
Can you , dear sir , grant me this favour ? '' 
`` I can , with the greatest pleasure , and I shall look upon it as an honour . '' 
I said this , though I felt almost dismayed , so greatly was I impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man . 
For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention , no one had come to me before with such a serious , stern , and concentrated expression . 
And now he had come to see me in my own rooms . 
He sat down . 
`` You are , I see , a man of great strength of character '' he said ; `` as you have dared to serve the truth , even when by doing so you risked incurring the contempt of all . '' 
`` Your praise is , perhaps , excessive , '' I replied . 
`` No , it 's not excessive , '' he answered ; `` believe me , such a course of action is far more difficult than you think . 
It is that which has impressed me , and it is only on that account that I have come to you , '' he continued . 
`` Tell me , please , that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps unseemly curiosity , what were your exact sensations , if you can recall them , at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel . 
Do not think my question frivolous ; on the contrary , I have in asking the question a secret motive of my own , which I will perhaps explain to you later on , if it is God 's will that we should become more intimately acquainted . '' 
All the while he was speaking , I was looking at him straight into the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on my side also , for I felt that there was some strange secret in his soul . 
`` You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my opponent 's forgiveness , '' I answered ; `` but I had better tell you from the beginning what I have not yet told anyone else . '' 
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me , and how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet . 
`` From that you can see for yourself , '' I concluded , `` that at the time of the duel it was easier for me , for I had made a beginning already at home , and when once I had started on that road , to go farther along it was far from being difficult , but became a source of joy and happiness . '' 
I liked the way he looked at me as he listened . 
`` All that , '' he said , `` is exceedingly interesting . 
I will come to see you again and again . '' 
And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening . 
And we should have become greater friends , if only he had ever talked of himself . 
But about himself he scarcely ever said a word , yet continually asked me about myself . 
In spite of that I became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all my feelings ; `` for , '' thought I , `` what need have I to know his secrets , since I can see without that that is a good man ? 
Moreover , though he is such a serious man and my senior , he comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal . '' 
And I learned a great deal that was profitable from him , for he was a man of lofty mind . 
`` That life is heaven , '' he said to me suddenly , `` that I have long been thinking about '' ; and all at once he added , `` I think of nothing else indeed . '' 
He looked at me and smiled . 
`` I am more convinced of it than you are , I will tell you later why . '' 
I listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me something . 
`` Heaven , '' he went on , `` lies hidden within all of us - here it lies hidden in me now , and if I will it , it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all time . '' 
I looked at him ; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing mysteriously at me , as if he were questioning me . 
`` And that we are all responsible to all for all , apart from our own sins , you were quite right in thinking that , and it is wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at once .
