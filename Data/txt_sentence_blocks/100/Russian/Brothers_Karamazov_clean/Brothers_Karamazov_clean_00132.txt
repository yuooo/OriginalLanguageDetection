`` Faro ? 
Splendid ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` If only the panovie - '' `` It 's lite , panovie , '' the Pole on the sofa responded , as it were unwillingly . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Lite ? 
What do you mean by ` lite ' ? '' 
asked Grushenka . 
`` Late , pani ! ' 
A late hour ' I mean , '' the Pole on the sofa explained . 
`` It 's always late with them . 
They can never do anything ! '' 
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger . 
`` They 're dull themselves , so they want others to be dull . 
Before came , Mitya , they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me . '' 
`` My goddess ! '' 
cried the Pole on the sofa , `` I see you 're not well-disposed to me , that 's why I 'm gloomy . 
I 'm ready , panie , '' added he , addressing Mitya . 
`` Begin , panie , '' Mitya assented , pulling his notes out of his pocket , and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table . 
`` I want to lose a lot to you . 
Take your cards . 
Make the bank . '' 
`` We 'll have cards from the landlord , panie , '' said the little Pole , gravely and emphatically . 
`` That 's much the best way , '' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` From the landlord ? 
Very good , I understand , let 's get them from him . 
Cards ! '' 
Mitya shouted to the landlord . 
The landlord brought in a new , unopened pack , and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready , and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon ; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived . 
Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders , but only three girls had arrived , and Marya was not there yet . 
And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out . 
He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls , the sweets , the toffee and the fondants . 
`` And vodka for Andrey , vodka for Andrey ! '' 
he cried in haste . 
`` I was rude to Andrey ! '' 
Suddenly Maximov , who had followed him out , touched him on the shoulder . 
`` Give me five roubles , '' he whispered to Mitya . 
`` I 'll stake something at faro , too , he he ! '' 
`` Capital ! 
Splendid ! 
Take ten , here ! '' 
Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles . 
`` And if you lose that , come again , come again . '' 
`` Very good , '' Maximov whispered joyfully , and he ran back again . 
Mitya , too , returned , apologising for having kept them waiting . 
The Poles had already sat down , and opened the pack . 
They looked much more amiable , almost cordial . 
The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw . 
He wore an air of solemnity . 
`` To your places , gentlemen , '' cried Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` No , I 'm not going to play any more , '' observed Kalganov , `` I 've lost fifty roubles to them just now . '' 
`` The pan had no luck , perhaps he 'll be lucky this time , '' the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction . 
`` How much in the bank ? 
To correspond ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` That 's according , panie , maybe a hundred , maybe two hundred , as much as you will stake . '' 
`` A million ! '' 
laughed Mitya . 
`` The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky , perhaps ? '' 
`` What Podvysotsky ? '' 
`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . ' 
The banker throws the dice . 
Podvysotsky wins . 
` Take it , panie , ' says the banker , and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million . 
` Take it , panie , this is your gain . ' 
There was a million in the bank . ' 
I did n't know that , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` Panie Podvysotsky , ' said the banker , ` you pledged your honour and we pledged ours . ' 
Podvysotsky took the million . '' 
`` That 's not true , '' said Kalganov . 
`` Panie Kalganov , in gentlemanly society one does n't say such things . '' 
`` As if a Polish gambler would give away a million ! '' 
cried Mitya , but checked himself at once . 
`` Forgive me , panie , it 's my fault again ; he would , he would give away a million , for honour , for Polish honour . 
You see how I talk Polish , ha ha ! 
Here , I stake ten roubles , the knave leads . '' 
`` And I put a rouble on the queen , the queen of hearts , the pretty little panienotchka * he ! 
he ! '' 
laughed Maximov , pulling out his queen , and , as though trying to conceal it from everyone , he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table . 
Mitya won . 
The rouble won , too . 
* Little miss . 
`` A corner ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I 'll bet another rouble , a ` single ' stake , '' Maximov muttered gleefully , hugely delighted at having won a rouble . 
`` Lost ! '' 
shouted Mitya . 
`` A ` double ' on the seven ! '' 
The seven too was trumped . 
`` Stop ! '' 
cried Kalganov suddenly . 
`` Double ! 
Double ! '' 
Mitya doubled his stakes , and each time he doubled the stake , the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles . 
The rouble stakes kept winning . 
`` On the double ! ''
