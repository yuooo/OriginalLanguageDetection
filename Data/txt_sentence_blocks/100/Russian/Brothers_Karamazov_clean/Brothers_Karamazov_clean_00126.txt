But as he flew through the night , he felt no envy , no hostility even , for the man who had been her first lover ... . 
It is true he had not yet seen him . 
`` Here there was no room for dispute : it was her right and his ; this was her first love which , after five years , she had not forgotten ; so she had loved him only for those five years , and I , how do I come in ? 
What right have I ? 
Step aside , Mitya , and make way ! 
What am I now ? 
Now everything is over apart from the officer even if he had not appeared , everything would be over ... '' These words would roughly have expressed his feelings , if he had been capable of reasoning . 
But he could not reason at that moment . 
His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning . 
At Fenya 's first words , it had sprung from feeling , and been adopted in a flash , with all its consequences . 
And yet , in spite of his resolution , there was confusion in his soul , an agonising confusion : his resolution did not give him peace . 
There was so much behind that tortured him . 
And it seemed strange to him , at moments , to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper : `` I punish myself , '' and the paper was lying there in his pocket , ready ; the pistol was loaded ; he had already resolved how , next morning , he would meet the first warm ray of `` golden-haired Phoebus . '' 
And yet he could not be quit of the past , of all that he had left behind and that tortured him . 
He felt that miserably , and the thought of it sank into his heart with despair . 
There was one moment when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey , to jump out of the cart , to pull out his loaded pistol , and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn . 
But that moment flew by like a spark . 
The horses galloped on , `` devouring space , '' and as he drew near his goal , again the thought of her , of her alone , took more and more complete possession of his soul , chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it . 
Oh , how he longed to look upon her , if only for a moment , if only from a distance ! 
`` She 's now with him , '' he thought , `` now I shall see what she looks like with him , her first love , and that 's all I want . '' 
Never had this woman , who was such a fateful influence in his life , aroused such love in his breast , such new and unknown feeling , surprising even to himself , a feeling tender to devoutness , to self-effacement before her ! 
`` I will efface myself ! '' 
he said , in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy . 
They had been galloping nearly an hour . 
Mitya was silent , and though Andrey was , as a rule , a talkative peasant , he did not utter a word , either . 
He seemed afraid to talk , he only whipped up smartly his three lean , but mettlesome , bay horses . 
Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible anxiety : `` Andrey ! 
What if they 're asleep ? '' 
This thought fell upon him like a blow . 
It had not occurred to him before . 
`` It may well be that they 're gone to bed by now , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
Mitya frowned as though in pain . 
Yes , indeed ... he was rushing there ... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep , perhaps , there too ... . 
An angry feeling surged up in his heart . 
`` Drive on , Andrey ! 
Whip them up ! 
Look alive ! '' 
he cried , beside himself . 
`` But maybe they 're not in bed ! '' 
Andrey went on after a pause . 
`` Timofey said they were a lot of them there - . '' 
`` At the station ? '' 
`` Not at the posting-station , but at Plastunov 's , at the inn , where they let out horses , too . '' 
`` I know . 
So you say there are a lot of them ? 
How 's that ? 
Who are they ? '' 
cried Mitya , greatly dismayed at this unexpected news . 
`` Well , Timofey was saying they 're all gentlefolk . 
Two from our town - who they are I ca n't say - and there are two others , strangers , maybe more besides . 
I did n't ask particularly . 
They 've set to playing cards , so Timofey said . '' 
`` Cards ? '' 
`` So , maybe they 're not in bed if they 're at cards . 
It 's most likely not more than eleven . '' 
`` Quicker , Andrey ! 
Quicker ! '' 
Mitya cried again , nervously . 
`` May I ask you something , sir ? '' 
said Andrey , after a pause . 
`` Only I 'm afraid of angering you , sir . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Why , Fenya threw herself at your feet just now , and begged you not to harm her mistress , and someone else , too ... so you see , sir - It 's I am taking you there ... forgive me , sir , it 's my conscience ... maybe it 's stupid of me to speak of it - . '' 
Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind . 
`` Are you a driver ? '' 
he asked frantically . 
`` Yes sir . '' 
`` Then you know that one has to make way . 
What would you say to a driver who would n't make way for anyone , but would just drive on and crush people ? 
No , a driver must n't run over people . 
One ca n't run over a man . 
One ca n't spoil people 's lives . 
And if you have spoilt a life - punish yourself ... . 
If only you 've spoilt , if only you 've ruined anyone 's life - punish yourself and go away . '' 
These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically . 
Though Andrey was surprised at him , he kept up the conversation . 
`` That 's right , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you 're quite right , one must n't crush or torment a man , or any kind of creature , for every creature is created by God . 
Take a horse , for instance , for some folks , even among us drivers , drive anyhow . 
Nothing will restrain them , they just force it along . '' 
`` To hell ? '' 
Mitya interrupted , and went off into his abrupt , short laugh . 
`` Andrey , simple soul , '' he seized him by the shoulders again , `` tell me , will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell , or not , what do you think ? '' 
`` I do n't know , darling , it depends on you , for you are ... you see , sir , when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died , He went straight down to hell from the Cross , and set free all sinners that were in agony . 
And the devil groaned , because he thought that he would get no more sinners in hell . 
And God said to him , then , ` Do n't groan , for you shall have all the mighty of the earth , the rulers , the chief judges , and the rich men , and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I come again . ' 
Those were His very words ... '' `` A peasant legend ! 
Capital ! 
Whip up the left , Andrey ! '' 
`` So you see , sir , who it is hell 's for , '' said Andrey , whipping up the left horse , `` but you 're like a little child ... that 's how we look on you ... and though you 're hasty-tempered , sir , yet God will forgive you for your kind heart . '' 
`` And you , do you forgive me , Andrey ? '' 
`` What should I forgive you for , sir ? 
You 've never done me any harm . '' 
`` No , for everyone , for everyone , you here alone , on the road , will you forgive me for everyone ? 
Speak , simple peasant heart ! '' 
`` Oh , sir ! 
I feel afraid of driving you , your talk is so strange . '' 
But Mitya did not hear . 
He was frantically praying and muttering to himself . 
`` Lord , receive me , with all my lawlessness , and do not condemn me . 
Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me , for I have condemned myself , do not condemn me , for I love Thee , O Lord .
