What an eye you 've got , I say ! 
I bet that was when I was talking about the goose . 
That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off , and for a moment I quite hated you for it , and began talking like a fool . 
Then I fancied - just now , here - when I said that if there were no God He would have to be invented , that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge , especially as I got that phrase out of a book . 
But I swear I was n't showing off out of vanity , though I really do n't know why . 
Because I was so pleased ? 
Yes , I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it 's perfectly disgraceful for anyone to be gushing directly they are pleased , I know that . 
But I am convinced now that you do n't despise me ; it was all my imagination . 
Oh , Karamazov , I am profoundly unhappy . 
I sometimes fancy all sorts of things , that everyone is laughing at me , the whole world , and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things . '' 
`` And you worry everyone about you , '' smiled Alyosha . 
`` Yes , I worry everyone about me , especially my mother . 
Karamazov , tell me , am I very ridiculous now ? '' 
`` Do n't think about that , do n't think of it at all ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` And what does ridiculous mean ? 
Is n't everyone constantly being or seeming ridiculous ? 
Besides , nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous , and that makes them unhappy . 
All I am surprised at is that you should be feeling that so early , though I 've observed it for some time past , , not only in you . 
Nowadays the very children have begun to suffer from it . 
It 's almost a sort of insanity . 
The devil has taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation ; it 's simply the devil , '' added Alyosha , without a trace of the smile that Kolya , staring at him , expected to see . 
`` You are like everyone else , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , `` that is , like very many others . 
Only you must not be like everybody else , that 's all . '' 
`` Even if everyone is like that ? '' 
`` Yes , even if everyone is like that . 
You be the only one not like it . 
You really are not like everyone else , here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad and even ridiculous . 
And who will admit so much in these days ? 
No one . 
And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self-criticism . 
Do n't be like everyone else , even if you are the only one . '' 
`` Splendid ! 
I was not mistaken in you . 
You know how to console one . 
Oh , how I have longed to know you , Karamazov ! 
I 've long been eager for this meeting . 
Can you really have thought about me , too ? 
You said just now that you thought of me , too ? '' 
`` Yes , I 'd heard of you and had thought of you , too ... and if it 's partly vanity that makes you ask , it does n't matter . '' 
`` Do you know , Karamazov , our talk has been like a declaration of love , '' said Kolya , in a bashful and melting voice . 
`` That 's not ridiculous , is it ? '' 
`` Not at all ridiculous , and if it were , it would n't matter , because it 's been a good thing . '' 
Alyosha smiled brightly . 
`` But do you know , Karamazov , you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself , now ... . 
I see it by your eyes . '' 
Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness . 
`` Why ashamed ? '' 
`` Well , why are you blushing ? '' 
`` It was you made me blush , '' laughed Alyosha , and he really did blush . 
`` Oh , well , I am a little , goodness knows why , I do n't know ... '' he muttered , almost embarrassed . 
`` Oh , how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed ! 
Because you are just like me , '' cried Kolya , in positive ecstasy . 
His cheeks glowed , his eyes beamed . 
`` You know , Kolya , you will be very unhappy in your life , '' something made Alyosha say suddenly . 
`` I know , I know . 
How you know it all before hand ! '' 
Kolya agreed at once . 
`` But you will bless life on the whole , all the same . '' 
`` Just so , hurrah ! 
You are a prophet . 
Oh , we shall get on together , Karamazov ! 
Do you know , what delights me most , is that you treat me quite like an equal . 
But we are not equals , no , we are not , you are better ! 
But we shall get on . 
Do you know , all this last month , I 've been saying to myself , ` Either we shall be friends at once , for ever , or we shall part enemies to the grave ! ' '' 
`` And saying that , of course , you loved me , '' Alyosha laughed gaily . 
`` I did . 
I loved you awfully . 
I 've been loving and dreaming of you . 
And how do you know it all beforehand ? 
Ah , here 's the doctor . 
Goodness ! 
What will he tell us ? 
Look at his face ! '' 
Ilusha THE doctor came out of the room again , muffled in his fur coat and with his cap on his head . 
His face looked almost angry and disgusted , as though he were afraid of getting dirty . 
He cast a cursory glance round the passage , looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so . 
Alyosha waved from the door to the coachman , and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up . 
The captain darted out after the doctor , and , bowing apologetically , stopped him to get the last word . 
The poor fellow looked utterly crushed ; there was a scared look in his eyes . 
`` Your Excellency , your Excellency ... is it possible ? '' 
he began , but could not go on and clasped his hands in despair . 
Yet he still gazed imploringly at the doctor , as though a word from him might still change the poor boy 's fate . 
`` I ca n't help it , I am not God ! '' 
the doctor answered offhand , though with the customary impressiveness . 
`` Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon , soon ? '' 
`` You must be prepared for anything , '' said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones , and dropping his eyes , he was about to step out to the coach . 
`` Your Excellency , for Christ 's sake ! '' 
the terror-stricken captain stopped him again . 
`` Your Excellency ! 
But can nothing , absolutely nothing save him now ? '' 
`` It 's not in my hands now , '' said the doctor impatiently , `` but h 'm ! 
... '' he stopped suddenly . 
`` If you could , for instance ... send ... your patient ... at once , without delay '' -LRB- the words `` at once , without delay , '' the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start -RRB- `` to Syracuse , the change to the new be-ne-ficial `` To Syracuse ! '' 
cried the captain , unable to grasp what was said . 
`` Syracuse is in Sicily , '' Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation . 
The doctor looked at him . 
`` Sicily ! 
Your Excellency , '' faltered the captain , `` but you 've seen '' - he spread out his hands , indicating his surroundings - `` mamma and my family ? ''
