Chemist or what ? '' 
`` He must be a savant , '' answered Alyosha ; `` but I confess I ca n't tell you much about him , either . 
I 've heard of him as a savant , but what sort I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , damn him , then ! 
I do n't know either , '' swore Mitya . 
`` A scoundrel of some sort , most likely . 
They are all scoundrels . 
And Rakitin will make his way . 
Rakitin will get on anywhere ; he is another Bernard . 
Ugh , these Bernards ! 
They are all over the place . '' 
`` But what is the matter ? '' 
Alyosha asked insistently . 
`` He wants to write an article about me , about my case , and so begin his literary career . 
That 's what he comes for ; he said so himself . 
He wants to prove some theory . 
He wants to say ` he could n't help murdering his father , he was corrupted by his environment , ' and so on . 
He explained it all to me . 
He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism , he says . 
But there , damn the fellow , he can put in a tinge if he likes , I do n't care . 
He ca n't bear Ivan , he hates him . 
He 's not fond of you , either . 
But I do n't turn him out , for he is a clever fellow . 
Awfully conceited , though . 
I said to him just now , ' The Karamazovs are not blackguards , but philosophers ; for all true Russians are philosophers , and though you 've studied , you are not a philosopher - you are a low fellow . ' 
He laughed , so maliciously . 
And I said to him , ` De ideabus non est disputandum . ' 
* Is n't that rather good ? 
I can set up for being a classic , you see ! '' 
Mitya laughed suddenly . 
* There 's no disputing ideas . 
`` Why is it all over with you ? 
You said so just now , '' Alyosha interposed . 
`` Why is it all over with me ? 
H 'm ! 
... The fact of it is ... if you take it as a whole , I am sorry to lose God - that 's why it is . '' 
`` What do you mean by ` sorry to lose God ' ? '' 
`` Imagine : inside , in the nerves , in the head - that is , these nerves are there in the brain ... -LRB- damn them ! -RRB- 
there are sort of little tails , the little tails of those nerves , and as soon as they begin quivering ... that is , you see , I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering , those little tails ... and when they quiver , then an image appears ... it does n't appear at once , but an instant , a second , passes ... and then something like a moment appears ; that is , not a moment - devil take the moment ! 
- but an image ; that is , an object , or an action , damn it ! 
That 's why I see and then think , because of those tails , not at all because I 've got a soul , and that I am some sort of image and likeness . 
All that is nonsense ! 
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday , brother , and it simply bowled me over . 
It 's magnificent , Alyosha , this science ! 
A new man 's arising - that I understand ... . 
And yet I am sorry to lose God ! '' 
`` Well , that 's a good thing , anyway , '' said Alyosha . 
`` That I am sorry to lose God ? 
It 's chemistry , brother , chemistry ! 
There 's no help for it , your reverence , you must make way for chemistry . 
And Rakitin does dislike God . 
Ough ! 
does n't he dislike Him ! 
That 's the sore point with all of them . 
But they conceal it . 
They tell lies . 
They pretend . 
` Will you preach this in your reviews ? ' 
I asked him . 
` Oh , well , if I did it openly , they wo n't let it through , ` he said . 
He laughed . 
` But what will become of men then ? ' 
I asked him , ` without God and immortal life ? 
All things are lawful then , they can do what they like ? ' 
` Did n't you know ? ' 
he said laughing , ' a clever man can do what he likes , ' he said . ' 
A clever man knows his way about , but you 've put your foot in it , committing a murder , and now you are rotting in prison . ' 
He says that to my face ! 
A regular pig ! 
I used to kick such people out , but now I listen to them . 
He talks a lot of sense , too . 
Writes well . 
He began reading me an article last week . 
I copied out three lines of it . 
Wait a minute . 
Here it is . '' 
Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read : '' ` In order to determine this question , it is above all essential to put one 's personality in contradiction to one 's reality . ' 
Do you understand that ? '' 
`` No , I do n't , '' said Alyosha . 
He looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity . 
`` I do n't understand either . 
It 's dark and obscure , but intellectual . 
` Everyone writes like that now , ' he says , ` it 's the effect of their environment . ' 
They are afraid of the environment . 
He writes poetry , too , the rascal . 
He 's written in honour of Madame Hohlakov 's foot . 
Ha ha ha ! '' 
`` I 've heard about it , '' said Alyosha . 
`` Have you ? 
And have you heard the poem ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I 've got it . 
Here it is . 
I 'll read it to you . 
You do n't know - I have n't told you - there 's quite a story about it . 
He 's a rascal ! 
Three weeks ago he began to tease me . 
` You 've got yourself into a mess , like a fool , for the sake of three thousand , but I 'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand . 
I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg . ' 
And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov .
