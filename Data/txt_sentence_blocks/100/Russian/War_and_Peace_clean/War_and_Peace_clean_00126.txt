-- But I have to tell you ... '' Natasha put her hand on her mother 's mouth . 
`` About Boris ... I know , '' she said seriously ; `` that 's what I have come about . 
Do n't say it -- I know . 
No , do tell me ! '' 
and she removed her hand . 
`` Tell me , Mamma ! 
He 's nice ? '' 
`` Natasha , you are sixteen . 
At your age I was married . 
You say Boris is nice . 
He is very nice , and I love him like a son . 
But what then ? 
... What are you thinking about ? 
You have quite turned his head , I can see that ... '' As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter . 
Natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead , so that the countess only saw her daughter 's face in profile . 
That face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression . 
Natasha was listening and considering . 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
said she . 
`` You have quite turned his head , and why ? 
What do you want of him ? 
You know you ca n't marry him . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
said Natasha , without changing her position . 
`` Because he is young , because he is poor , because he is a relation ... and because you yourself do n't love him . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` I know . 
It is not right , darling ! '' 
`` But if I want to ... '' said Natasha . 
`` Leave off talking nonsense , '' said the countess . 
`` But if I want to ... '' `` Natasha , I am in earnest ... '' Natasha did not let her finish . 
She drew the countess ' large hand to her , kissed it on the back and then on the palm , then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle , then the space between the knuckles , then the next knuckle , whispering , `` January , February , March , April , May . 
Speak , Mamma , why do n't you say anything ? 
Speak ! '' 
said she , turning to her mother , who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say . 
`` It wo n't do , my love ! 
Not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days , and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us , and above all it torments him for nothing . 
He may already have found a suitable and wealthy match , and now he 's half crazy . '' 
`` Crazy ? '' 
repeated Natasha . 
`` I 'll tell you some things about myself . 
I had a cousin ... '' `` I know ! 
Cyril Matveich ... but he is old . '' 
`` He was not always old . 
But this is what I 'll do , Natasha , I 'll have a talk with Boris . 
He need not come so often ... '' `` Why not , if he likes to ? '' 
`` Because I know it will end in nothing ... '' `` How can you know ? 
No , Mamma , do n't speak to him ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
said Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property . 
`` Well , I wo n't marry , but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it . '' 
Natasha smiled and looked at her mother . 
`` Not to marry , but just so , '' she added . 
`` How so , my pet ? '' 
`` Just so . 
There 's no need for me to marry him . 
But ... just so . '' 
`` Just so , just so , '' repeated the countess , and shaking all over , she went off into a good humored , unexpected , elderly laugh . 
`` Do n't laugh , stop ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` You 're shaking the whole bed ! 
You 're awfully like me , just such another giggler ... . 
Wait ... '' and she seized the countess ' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger , saying , `` June , '' and continued , kissing , `` July , August , '' on the other hand . 
`` But , Mamma , is he very much in love ? 
What do you think ? 
Was anybody ever so much in love with you ? 
And he 's very nice , very , very nice . 
Only not quite my taste -- he is so narrow , like the dining-room clock ... . 
Do n't you understand ? 
Narrow , you know -- gray , light gray ... '' `` What rubbish you 're talking ! '' 
said the countess . 
Natasha continued : `` Do n't you really understand ? 
Nicholas would understand ... . 
Bezukhov , now , is blue , dark-blue and red , and he is square . '' 
`` You flirt with him too , '' said the countess , laughing . 
`` No , he is a Freemason , I have found out . 
He is fine , dark-blue and red ... . 
How can I explain it to you ? '' 
`` Little countess ! '' 
the count 's voice called from behind the door . 
`` You 're not asleep ? '' 
Natasha jumped up , snatched up her slippers , and ran barefoot to her own room . 
It was a long time before she could sleep . 
She kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her . 
`` Sonya ? '' 
she thought , glancing at that curled-up , sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair . 
`` No , how could she ? 
She 's virtuous . 
She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more . 
Even Mamma does not understand . 
It is wonderful how clever I am and how ... charming she is , '' she went on , speaking of herself in the third person , and imagining it was some very wise man -- the wisest and best of men -- who was saying it of her . 
`` There is everything , everything in her , '' continued this man . 
`` She is unusually intelligent , charming ... and then she is pretty , uncommonly pretty , and agile -- she swims and rides splendidly ... and her voice ! 
One can really say it 's a wonderful voice ! '' 
She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini , threw herself on her bed , laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep , called Dunyasha the maid to put out the candle , and before Dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams , where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality , and even more so because it was different . 
Next day the countess called Boris aside and had a talk with him , after which he ceased coming to the Rostovs ' . 
On the thirty-first of December , New Year 's Eve , 1809 -- 10 an old grandee of Catherine 's day was giving a ball and midnight supper . 
The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present . 
The grandee 's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with innumerable lights . 
Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize , and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch .
