You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles ' worth of things in the house . 
I do n't consent , my dear , I do n't ! 
Do as you please ! 
It 's the government 's business to look after the wounded ; they know that . 
Look at the Lopukhins opposite , they cleared out everything two days ago . 
That 's what other people do . 
It 's only we who are such fools . 
If you have no pity on me , have some for the children . '' 
Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying . 
`` Papa , what are you doing that for ? '' 
asked Natasha , who had followed him into her mother 's room . 
`` Nothing ! 
What business is it of yours ? '' 
muttered the count angrily . 
`` But I heard , '' said Natasha . 
`` Why does Mamma object ? '' 
`` What business is it of yours ? '' 
cried the count . 
Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered . 
`` Papa ! 
Here 's Berg coming to see us , '' said she , looking out of the window . 
Berg , the Rostovs ' son-in-law , was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vladimir and Anna , and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army . 
On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army . 
He had nothing to do in Moscow , but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there . 
So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons . 
Berg drove up to his father-in-law 's house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans , exactly like those of a certain prince . 
He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it . 
From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room , where he embraced the count , kissed the hands of Natasha and Sonya , and hastened to inquire after `` Mamma 's '' health . 
`` Health , at a time like this ? '' 
said the count . 
`` Come , tell us the news ! 
Is the army retreating or will there be another battle ? '' 
`` God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland , Papa , '' said Berg . 
`` The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders , so to say , have now assembled in council . 
No one knows what is coming . 
But in general I can tell you , Papa , that such a heroic spirit , the truly antique valor of the Russian army , which they -- which it '' -LRB- he corrected himself -RRB- `` has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth -- there are no words worthy to do it justice ! 
I tell you , Papa '' -LRB- he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done , but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words `` Russian army '' -RRB- , `` I tell you frankly that we , the commanders , far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind , could hardly restrain those ... those ... yes , those exploits of antique valor , '' he went on rapidly . 
`` General Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops , I can assure you . 
Our corps was stationed on a hillside . 
You can imagine ! '' 
And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days . 
Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him , as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question . 
`` Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors can not be imagined or adequately praised ! '' 
said Berg , glancing round at Natasha , and as if anxious to conciliate her , replying to her intent look with a smile . '' 
` Russia is not in Moscow , she lives in the hearts of her sons ! ' 
Is n't it so , Papa ? '' 
said he . 
Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression . 
Berg hurriedly jumped up , kissed her hand , asked about her health , and , swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy , remained standing beside her . 
`` Yes , Mamma , I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every Russian . 
But why are you so anxious ? 
You have still time to get away ... '' `` I ca n't think what the servants are about , '' said the countess , turning to her husband . 
`` I have just been told that nothing is ready yet . 
Somebody after all must see to things . 
One misses Mitenka at such times . 
There wo n't be any end to it . '' 
The count was about to say something , but evidently restrained himself . 
He got up from his chair and went to the door . 
At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and , seeing the knot in it , pondered , shaking his head sadly and significantly . 
`` And I have a great favor to ask of you , Papa , '' said he . 
`` Hm ... '' said the count , and stopped . 
`` I was driving past Yusupov 's house just now , '' said Berg with a laugh , `` when the steward , a man I know , ran out and asked me whether I would n't buy something . 
I went in out of curiosity , you know , and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table . 
You know how dear Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it . '' 
-LRB- At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements . -RRB- 
`` And it 's such a beauty ! 
It pulls out and has a secret English drawer , you know ! 
And dear Vera has long wanted one . 
I wish to give her a surprise , you see . 
I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard . 
Please let me have one , I will pay the man well , and ... '' The count frowned and coughed . 
`` Ask the countess , I do n't give orders . '' 
`` If it 's inconvenient , please do n't , '' said Berg . 
`` Only I so wanted it , for dear Vera 's sake . '' 
`` Oh , go to the devil , all of you ! 
To the devil , the devil , the devil ... '' cried the old count . 
`` My head 's in a whirl ! '' 
And he left the room . 
The countess began to cry . 
`` Yes , Mamma ! 
Yes , these are very hard times ! '' 
said Berg . 
Natasha left the room with her father and , as if finding it difficult to reach some decision , first followed him and then ran downstairs . 
Petya was in the porch , engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave Moscow . 
The loaded carts were still standing in the yard . 
Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly . 
`` Do you know what it 's about ? '' 
Petya asked Natasha . 
She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about . 
She did not answer . 
`` It 's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded , '' said Petya . 
`` Vasilich told me . 
I consider ... '' `` I consider , '' Natasha suddenly almost shouted , turning her angry face to Petya , `` I consider it so horrid , so abominable , so ... I do n't know what . 
Are we despicable Germans ? '' 
Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and , afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste , she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs . 
Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative . 
The count , pipe in hand , was pacing up and down the room , when Natasha , her face distorted by anger , burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps . 
`` It 's horrid ! 
It 's abominable ! '' 
she screamed .
