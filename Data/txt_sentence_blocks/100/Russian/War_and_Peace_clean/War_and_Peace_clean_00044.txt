he exclaimed in German . 
`` What a calamity ! 
What a calamity ! '' 
Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew , evidently considering something . 
`` Ah what a calamity ! 
You say the affair was decisive ? 
But Mortier is not captured . '' 
Again he pondered . 
`` I am very glad you have brought good news , though Schmidt 's death is a heavy price to pay for the victory . 
His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you , but not today . 
I thank you ! 
You must have a rest . 
Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade . 
However , I will let you know . '' 
The stupid smile , which had left his face while he was speaking , reappeared . 
`` Au revoir ! 
Thank you very much . 
His Majesty will probably desire to see you , '' he added , bowing his head . 
When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant . 
The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed ; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past . 
Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin , a Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service . 
`` Ah , my dear prince ! 
I could not have a more welcome visitor , '' said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew . 
`` Franz , put the prince 's things in my bedroom , '' said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski in . 
`` So you 're a messenger of victory , eh ? 
Splendid ! 
And I am sitting here ill , as you see . '' 
After washing and dressing , Prince Andrew came into the diplomat 's luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him . 
Bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire . 
After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life , Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood . 
Besides it was pleasant , after his reception by the Austrians , to speak if not in Russian -LRB- for they were speaking French -RRB- at least with a Russian who would , he supposed , share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong . 
Bilibin was a man of thirty-five , a bachelor , and of the same circle as Prince Andrew . 
They had known each other previously in Petersburg , but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutuzov . 
Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession , so to an even greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career . 
He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat , as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen , had been in Paris and Copenhagen , and now held a rather important post in Vienna . 
Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him . 
He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities , avoid doing certain things , and speak French . 
He was one of those , who , liking work , knew how to do it , and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table . 
He worked well whatever the import of his work . 
It was not the question `` What for ? '' 
but the question `` How ? '' 
that interested him . 
What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care , but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular , memorandum , or report , skillfully , pointedly , and elegantly . 
Bilibin 's services were valued not only for what he wrote , but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres . 
Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work , only when it could be made elegantly witty . 
In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible . 
His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original , finished phrases of general interest . 
These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally , so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room . 
And , in fact , Bilibin 's witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important . 
His thin , worn , sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles , which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one 's fingers after a Russian bath . 
The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face . 
Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted , then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks . 
His small , deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight . 
`` Well , now tell me about your exploits , '' said he . 
Bolkonski , very modestly without once mentioning himself , described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War . 
`` They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles , '' said he in conclusion . 
Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared . 
`` Cependant , mon cher , '' he remarked , examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye , `` malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army , j' avoue que votre victoire n'est pas des plus victorieuses . '' 
* * `` But my dear fellow , with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army , I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious . '' 
He went on talking in this way in French , uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis . 
`` Come now ! 
You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division , and even then Mortier slips through your fingers ! 
Where 's the victory ? '' 
`` But seriously , '' said Prince Andrew , `` we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm ... '' `` Why did n't you capture one , just one , marshal for us ? '' 
`` Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade . 
We had expected , as I told you , to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon . '' 
`` And why did n't you do it at seven in the morning ? 
You ought to have been there at seven in the morning , '' returned Bilibin with a smile . 
`` You ought to have been there at seven in the morning . '' 
`` Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone ? '' 
retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone . 
`` I know , '' interrupted Bilibin , `` you 're thinking it 's very easy to take marshals , sitting on a sofa by the fire ! 
That is true , but still why did n't you capture him ? 
So do n't be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your victory . 
Even I , a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy , do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler , or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater ... True , we have no Prater here ... '' He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead . 
`` It is now my turn to ask you ` why ? ' 
mon cher , '' said Bolkonski . 
`` I confess I do not understand : perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence , but I ca n't make it out . 
Mack loses a whole army , the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder . 
Kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory , destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French , and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details . '' 
`` That 's just it , my dear fellow . 
You see it 's hurrah for the Tsar , for Russia , for the Orthodox Greek faith ! 
All that is beautiful , but what do we , I mean the Austrian court , care for your victories ? 
Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand -LRB- one archduke 's as good as another , as you know -RRB- and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte 's , that will be another story and we 'll fire off some cannon ! 
But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us . 
The Archduke Karl does nothing , the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself . 
You abandon Vienna , give up its defense -- as much as to say : ` Heaven is with us , but heaven help you and your capital ! ' 
The one general whom we all loved , Schmidt , you expose to a bullet , and then you congratulate us on the victory ! 
Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived . 
It 's as if it had been done on purpose , on purpose . 
Besides , suppose you did gain a brilliant victory , if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory , what effect would that have on the general course of events ? 
It 's too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army ! '' 
`` What ? 
Occupied ? 
Vienna occupied ? '' 
`` Not only occupied , but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn , and the count , our dear Count Vrbna , goes to him for orders . '' 
After the fatigues and impressions of the journey , his reception , and especially after having dined , Bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard . 
`` Count Lichtenfels was here this morning , '' Bilibin continued , `` and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully described : Prince Murat et tout le tremblement ... You see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you ca n't be received as a savior . '' 
`` Really I do n't care about that , I do n't care at all , '' said Prince Andrew , beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria 's capital . 
`` How is it Vienna was taken ?
