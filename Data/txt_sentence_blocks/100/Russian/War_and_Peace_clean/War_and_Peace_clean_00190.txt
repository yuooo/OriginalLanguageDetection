said Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` Go and get it for me , '' said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` You know -- under the paperweight on the little table . '' 
Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly . 
`` No , do n't ! '' 
he exclaimed with a frown . 
`` You go , Michael Ivanovich . '' 
Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study . 
But as soon as he had left the room the old prince , looking uneasily round , threw down his napkin and went himself . 
`` They ca n't do anything ... always make some muddle , '' he muttered . 
While he was away Princess Mary , Dessalles , Mademoiselle Bourienne , and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence . 
The old prince returned with quick steps , accompanied by Michael Ivanovich , bringing the letter and a plan . 
These he put down beside him -- not letting anyone read them at dinner . 
On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and , spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it , told her to read the letter aloud . 
When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father . 
He was examining the plan , evidently engrossed in his own ideas . 
`` What do you think of it , Prince ? '' 
Dessalles ventured to ask . 
`` I ? 
I ? 
... '' said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened , and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building . 
`` Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that ... '' `` Ha ha ha ! 
The theater of war ! '' 
said the prince . 
`` I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen . '' 
Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince , who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper , but Princess Mary , forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen , thought that what her father was saying was correct . 
`` When the snow melts they 'll sink in the Polish swamps . 
Only they could fail to see it , '' the prince continued , evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent . 
`` Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner , then things would have taken a different turn ... '' `` But , Prince , '' Dessalles began timidly , `` the letter mentions Vitebsk ... '' `` Ah , the letter ? 
Yes ... '' replied the prince peevishly . 
`` Yes ... yes ... '' His face suddenly took on a morose expression . 
He paused . 
`` Yes , he writes that the French were beaten at ... at ... what river is it ? '' 
Dessalles dropped his eyes . 
`` The prince says nothing about that , '' he remarked gently . 
`` Does n't he ? 
But I did n't invent it myself . '' 
No one spoke for a long time . 
`` Yes ... yes ... Well , Michael Ivanovich , '' he suddenly went on , raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building , `` tell me how you mean to alter it ... '' Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan , and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room . 
Princess Mary saw Dessalles ' embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father , noticed his silence , and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son 's letter on the drawing-room table ; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence , but was afraid even to think about it . 
In the evening Michael Ivanovich , sent by the prince , came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew 's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room . 
She gave it to him and , unpleasant as it was to her to do so , ventured to ask him what her father was doing . 
`` Always busy , '' replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale . 
`` He 's worrying very much about the new building . 
He has been reading a little , but now '' -- Michael Ivanovich went on , lowering his voice -- `` now he 's at his desk , busy with his will , I expect . '' 
-LRB- One of the prince 's favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his `` will . '' -RRB- 
`` And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk ? '' 
asked Princess Mary . 
`` Oh , yes , he has been waiting to start for some time . '' 
When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter , the old prince , with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes , was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles , holding a paper in his outstretched hand , and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript -- his `` Remarks '' as he termed it -- which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death . 
When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince 's eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written . 
He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich 's hand , put it in his pocket , folded up his papers , and called in Alpatych who had long been waiting . 
The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and , walking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door , he gave his instructions . 
`` First , notepaper -- do you hear ? 
Eight quires , like this sample , gilt-edged ... it must be exactly like the sample . 
Varnish , sealing wax , as in Michael Ivanovich 's list . '' 
He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes . 
`` Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed . '' 
Next , bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed , and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the `` will '' in . 
The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go . 
He sat down , sank into thought , closed his eyes , and dozed off . 
Alpatych made a slight movement . 
`` Well , go , go ! 
If anything more is wanted I 'll send after you . '' 
Alpatych went out . 
The prince again went to his bureau , glanced into it , fingered his papers , closed the bureau again , and sat down at the table to write to the governor . 
It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter . 
He wished to sleep , but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed . 
So he called Tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night . 
He went about looking at every corner . 
Every place seemed unsatisfactory , but worst of all was his customary couch in the study . 
That couch was dreadful to him , probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there . 
It was unsatisfactory everywhere , but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places : he had never slept there yet . 
With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up . 
`` That 's not right ! 
That 's not right ! '' 
cried the prince , and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again . 
`` Well , at last I 've finished , now I 'll rest , '' thought the prince , and let Tikhon undress him . 
Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers , the prince undressed , sat down heavily on the bed , and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs . 
He was not meditating , but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed . 
`` Ugh , how hard it is ! 
Oh , that this toil might end and you would release me ! '' 
thought he . 
Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down . 
But hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting . 
This happened to him almost every night . 
He opened his eyes as they were closing . 
`` No peace , damn them ! '' 
he muttered , angry he knew not with whom . 
`` Ah yes , there was something else important , very important , that I was keeping till I should be in bed . 
The bolts ? 
No , I told him about them . 
No , it was something , something in the drawing room . 
Princess Mary talked some nonsense . 
Dessalles , that fool , said something . 
Something in my pocket -- ca n't remember ... '' `` Tikhon , what did we talk about at dinner ? '' 
`` About Prince Michael ... '' `` Be quiet , quiet ! '' 
The prince slapped his hand on the table . 
`` Yes , I know , Prince Andrew 's letter ! 
Princess Mary read it .
