They say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them . 
But in that case , if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves , what significance have those leaders ? 
The leaders , these historians tell us , express the will of the people : the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people . 
But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people 's will or only some part of it . 
If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people 's will , as some historians suppose , then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation , which is evident nonsense ; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people 's life , as other so-called `` philosophical '' historians believe , then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation 's life , we have first of all to know in what the nation 's life consists . 
Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure , impalpable , and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences , and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity 's movement . 
The most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are : freedom , equality , enlightenment , progress , civilization , and culture . 
Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity , the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained : kings , ministers , generals , authors , reformers , popes , and journalists , to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction . 
But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom , equality , enlightenment , or civilization , and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed , it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate , burn houses , abandon agriculture , and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses , practice agriculture , or slay their fellow creatures . 
History proves this at every turn . 
Is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV , XV , and XVI , their mistresses and ministers , and by the lives of Napoleon , Rousseau , Diderot , Beaumarchais , and others ? 
Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the Terrible and by his correspondence with Kurbski ? 
Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies ? 
For us that movement of the peoples from west to east , without leaders , with a crowd of vagrants , and with Peter the Hermit , remains incomprehensible . 
And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade -- the deliverance of Jerusalem -- had been clearly defined by historic leaders . 
Popes , kings , and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land ; but the people did not go , for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed . 
The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples . 
And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers , but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown . 
Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples . 
The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer . 
We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things ; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books ; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another , nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined one another . 
If we unite both these kinds of history , as is done by the newest historians , we shall have the history of monarchs and writers , but not the history of the life of the peoples . 
The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men , for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found . 
The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history . 
The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes , but in its application to history , as soon as revolutions , conquests , or civil wars occur -- that is , as soon as history begins -- that theory explains nothing . 
The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people 's will can not be verified , for it never occurred . 
Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs , the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him . 
The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who , watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field , or to the driving of the herdsman , should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head . 
`` The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader . '' 
This is what historians of the first class say -- those who assume the unconditional transference of the people 's will . 
`` If the animals leading the herd change , this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another , according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd . '' 
Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known . 
-LRB- With this method of observation it often happens that the observer , influenced by the direction he himself prefers , regards those as leaders who , owing to the people 's change of direction , are no longer in front , but on one side , or even in the rear . -RRB- 
`` If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered , this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention , and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd . '' 
So say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons , from monarchs to journalists , as the expression of their age . 
The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase -- a restatement of the question in other words . 
What causes historical events ? 
Power . 
What is power ? 
Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person . 
Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person ? 
On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people . 
That is , power is power : in other words , power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand . 
If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning , then having subjected to criticism the explanation of `` power '' that juridical science gives us , humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence . 
But to understand phenomena man has , besides abstract reasoning , experience by which he verifies his reflections . 
And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon . 
Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power , the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events . 
Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear , by whose will the event seems to have taken place . 
Napoleon III issues a decree and the French go to Mexico . 
The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an army enters Bohemia . 
Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia . 
Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the Bourbons . 
Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it . 
The historians , in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs , want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power , but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience . 
On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man 's will -- his words -- are only part of the general activity expressed in an event , as for instance in a war or a revolution , and so without assuming an incomprehensible , supernatural force -- a miracle -- one can not admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men . 
On the other hand , even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events , history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect , that is to say , their commands are often not executed , and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs . 
Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we can not regard `` power '' as the cause of events . 
Power , from the standpoint of experience , is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone 's will and the execution of that will by others . 
To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will , referring it to man and not to the Deity . 
If the Deity issues a command , expresses His will , as ancient history tells us , the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything , for the Divinity is not controlled by an event . 
But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another , to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the condition of all that takes place : the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command . 
Only the expression of the will of the Deity , not dependent on time , can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries , and only the Deity , independent of everything , can by His sole will determine the direction of humanity 's movement ; but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs . 
Reinstating the first condition omitted , that of time , we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible . 
No command ever appears spontaneously , or itself covers a whole series of occurrences ; but each command follows from another , and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event . 
When , for instance , we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war , we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another . 
Napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so . 
Today he ordered such and such papers to be written to Vienna , to Berlin , and to Petersburg ; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army , the fleet , the commissariat , and so on and so on -- millions of commands , which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into Russia . 
If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort , and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia , with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance -LRB- a conviction he repeatedly expressed -RRB- -- this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case , but did so correspond in the latter . 
For an order to be certainly executed , it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed . 
But to know what can and what can not be executed is impossible , not only in the case of Napoleon 's invasion of Russia in which millions participated , but even in the simplest event , for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution . 
Every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted . 
All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted . 
Only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events , and are executed . 
Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed , we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be . 
Apart from that , the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable , diverse , and petty events , such for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia , is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events , and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will . 
We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it . 
In reality in all Napoleon 's activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish , but find a series of orders , or expressions of his will , very variously and indefinitely directed . 
Amid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon 's one series , for the campaign of 1812 , was carried out -- not because those orders differed in any way from the other , unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French army into Russia ; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way , but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil . 
So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events , we find that a command can never be the cause of the event , but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two . 
To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the Deity but from a man , which is , that the man who gives the command himself takes part in . 
This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power . 
This relation consists in the following : For common action people always unite in certain combinations , in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action , the relation between those taking part in it is always the same . 
Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share , and the smaller number a less direct share , in the collective action for which they have combined . 
Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army . 
Every army is composed of lower grades of the service -- the rank and file -- of whom there are always the greatest number ; of the next higher military rank -- corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer , and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer , and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person . 
A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone , of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file ; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army , and so on to the apex , the point of which will represent the commander in chief . 
The soldiers , of whom there are the most , form the lower section of the cone and its base . 
The soldier himself does the stabbing , hacking , burning , and pillaging , and always receives orders for these actions from men above him ; he himself never gives an order . 
The noncommissioned officers -LRB- of whom there are fewer -RRB- perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers , but they already give commands . 
An officer still less often acts directly himself , but commands still more frequently . 
A general does nothing but command the troops , indicates the objective , and hardly ever uses a weapon himself . 
The commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself , but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops . 
A similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity -- in agriculture , trade , and every administration . 
And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army , or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest , we see a law by which men , to take associated action , combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are , while the less their direct participation in the action itself , the more they command and the fewer of them there are ; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top , who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding . 
This relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power . 
Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur , find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events . 
Restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute , we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding . 
When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it , and as the event results from the collective activity of many people , some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately . 
When one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled , that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it . 
Men are hauling a log .
