`` I am at your disposal , '' she murmured . 
Natasha knew that she ought to go away , but was unable to do so : something gripped her throat , and regardless of manners she stared straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes . 
`` At once ? 
This instant ! 
... No , it ca n't be ! '' 
she thought . 
Again he glanced at her , and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken . 
Yes , at once , that very instant , her fate would be decided . 
`` Go , Natasha ! 
I will call you , '' said the countess in a whisper . 
Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at her mother and went out . 
`` I have come , Countess , to ask for your daughter 's hand , '' said Prince Andrew . 
The countess ' face flushed hotly , but she said nothing . 
`` Your offer ... '' she began at last sedately . 
He remained silent , looking into her eyes . 
`` Your offer ... '' -LRB- she grew confused -RRB- `` is agreeable to us , and I accept your offer . 
I am glad . 
And my husband ... I hope ... but it will depend on her ... '' `` I will speak to her when I have your consent ... . 
Do you give it to me ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Yes , '' replied the countess . 
She held out her hand to him , and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand . 
She wished to love him as a son , but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man . 
`` I am sure my husband will consent , '' said the countess , `` but your father ... '' `` My father , to whom I have told my plans , has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year . 
And I wished to tell you of that , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` It is true that Natasha is still young , but -- so long as that ? 
... '' `` It is unavoidable , '' said Prince Andrew with a sigh . 
`` I will send her to you , '' said the countess , and left the room . 
`` Lord have mercy upon us ! '' 
she repeated while seeking her daughter . 
Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom . 
Natasha was sitting on the bed , pale and dry eyed , and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself . 
Seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her . 
`` Well , Mamma ? 
... Well ? 
... '' `` Go , go to him . 
He is asking for your hand , '' said the countess , coldly it seemed to Natasha . 
`` Go ... go , '' said the mother , sadly and reproachfully , with a deep sigh , as her daughter ran away . 
Natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room . 
When she came in and saw him she paused . 
`` Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me ? '' 
she asked herself , and immediately answered , `` Yes , everything ! 
He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world . '' 
Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes . 
`` I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you . 
May I hope ? '' 
He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face . 
Her face said : `` Why ask ? 
Why doubt what you can not but know ? 
Why speak , when words can not express what one feels ? '' 
She drew near to him and stopped . 
He took her hand and kissed it . 
`` Do you love me ? '' 
`` Yes , yes ! '' 
Natasha murmured as if in vexation . 
Then she sighed loudly and , catching her breath more and more quickly , began to sob . 
`` What is it ? 
What 's the matter ? '' 
`` Oh , I am so happy ! '' 
she replied , smiled through her tears , bent over closer to him , paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might , and then kissed him . 
Prince Andrew held her hands , looked into her eyes , and did not find in his heart his former love for her . 
Something in him had suddenly changed ; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire , but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness , fear at her devotion and trustfulness , and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever . 
The present feeling , though not so bright and poetic as the former , was stronger and more serious . 
`` Did your mother tell you that it can not be for a year ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew , still looking into her eyes . 
`` Is it possible that I -- the ` chit of a girl , ' as everybody called me , '' thought Natasha -- `` is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange , dear , clever man whom even my father looks up to ? 
Can it be true ? 
Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life , that now I am grown up , that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed ? 
Yes , but what did he ask me ? '' 
`` No , '' she replied , but she had not understood his question . 
`` Forgive me ! '' 
he said . 
`` But you are so young , and I have already been through so much in life . 
I am afraid for you , you do not yet know yourself . '' 
Natasha listened with concentrated attention , trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words . 
`` Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be , '' continued Prince Andrew , `` it will give you time to be sure of yourself . 
I ask you to make me happy in a year , but you are free : our engagement shall remain a secret , and should you find that you do not love me , or should you come to love ... '' said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile . 
`` Why do you say that ? '' 
Natasha interrupted him . 
`` You know that from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you , '' she cried , quite convinced that she spoke the truth . 
`` In a year you will learn to know yourself ... '' `` A whole year ! '' 
Natasha repeated suddenly , only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year . 
`` But why a year ? 
Why a year ? 
... '' Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay . 
Natasha did not hear him . 
`` And ca n't it be helped ? '' 
she asked . 
Prince Andrew did not reply , but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision . 
`` It 's awful ! 
Oh , it 's awful ! 
awful ! '' 
Natasha suddenly cried , and again burst into sobs . 
`` I shall die , waiting a year : it 's impossible , it 's awful ! '' 
She looked into her lover 's face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity . 
`` No , no ! 
I 'll do anything ! '' 
she said , suddenly checking her tears . 
`` I am so happy . '' 
The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing .
