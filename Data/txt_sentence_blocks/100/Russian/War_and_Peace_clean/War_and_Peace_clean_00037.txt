Really I have some , '' Rostov repeated . 
`` No , I tell you . '' 
And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow . 
`` Where have you put it , Wostov ? '' 
`` Under the lower pillow . '' 
`` It 's not there . '' 
Denisov threw both pillows on the floor . 
The purse was not there . 
`` That 's a miwacle . '' 
`` Wait , have n't you dropped it ? '' 
said Rostov , picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them . 
He pulled off the quilt and shook it . 
The purse was not there . 
`` Dear me , can I have forgotten ? 
No , I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure , '' said Rostov . 
`` I put it just here . 
Where is it ? '' 
he asked , turning to Lavrushka . 
`` I have n't been in the room . 
It must be where you put it . '' 
`` But it is n't ? 
... '' `` You 're always like that ; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it . 
Feel in your pockets . '' 
`` No , if I had n't thought of it being a treasure , '' said Rostov , `` but I remember putting it there . '' 
Lavrushka turned all the bedding over , looked under the bed and under the table , searched everywhere , and stood still in the middle of the room . 
Denisov silently watched Lavrushka 's movements , and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denisov glanced at Rostov . 
`` Wostov , you 've not been playing schoolboy twicks ... '' Rostov felt Denisov 's gaze fixed on him , raised his eyes , and instantly dropped them again . 
All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes . 
He could not draw breath . 
`` And there has n't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves . 
It must be here somewhere , '' said Lavrushka . 
`` Now then , you devil 's puppet , look alive and hunt for it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture . 
`` If the purse is n't found I 'll flog you , I 'll flog you all . '' 
Rostov , his eyes avoiding Denisov , began buttoning his coat , buckled on his saber , and put on his cap . 
`` I must have that purse , I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall . 
`` Denisov , let him alone , I know who has taken it , '' said Rostov , going toward the door without raising his eyes . 
Denisov paused , thought a moment , and , evidently understanding what Rostov hinted at , seized his arm . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he cried , and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords . 
`` You are mad , I tell you . 
I wo n't allow it . 
The purse is here ! 
I 'll flay this scoundwel alive , and it will be found . '' 
`` I know who has taken it , '' repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice , and went to the door . 
`` And I tell you , do n't you dahe to do it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , rushing at the cadet to restrain him . 
But Rostov pulled away his arm and , with as much anger as though Denisov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face . 
`` Do you understand what you 're saying ? '' 
he said in a trembling voice . 
`` There was no one else in the room except myself . 
So that if it is not so , then ... '' He could not finish , and ran out of the room . 
`` Ah , may the devil take you and evewybody , '' were the last words Rostov heard . 
Rostov went to Telyanin 's quarters . 
`` The master is not in , he 's gone to headquarters , '' said Telyanin 's orderly . 
`` Has something happened ? '' 
he added , surprised at the cadet 's troubled face . 
`` No , nothing . '' 
`` You 've only just missed him , '' said the orderly . 
The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck , and Rostov , without returning home , took a horse and rode there . 
There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented . 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin 's horse at the porch . 
In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine . 
`` Ah , you 've come here too , young man ! '' 
he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows . 
`` Yes , '' said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word ; and he sat down at the nearest table . 
Both were silent . 
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room . 
No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant . 
When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and , drawing its rings aside with his small , white , turned-up fingers , drew out a gold imperial , and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter . 
`` Please be quick , '' he said . 
The coin was a new one . 
Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin . 
`` Allow me to look at your purse , '' he said in a low , almost inaudible , voice . 
With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised , Telyanin handed him the purse . 
`` Yes , it 's a nice purse . 
Yes , yes , '' he said , growing suddenly pale , and added , `` Look at it , young man . '' 
Rostov took the purse in his hand , examined it and the money in it , and looked at Telyanin . 
The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry . 
`` If we get to Vienna I 'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there 's nowhere to spend it , '' said he . 
`` Well , let me have it , young man , I 'm going . '' 
Rostov did not speak . 
`` And you ? 
Are you going to have lunch too ? 
They feed you quite decently here , '' continued Telyanin . 
`` Now then , let me have it . '' 
He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse . 
Rostov let go of it . 
Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches , with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open , as if to say , `` Yes , yes , I am putting my purse in my pocket and that 's quite simple and is no else 's business . '' 
`` Well , young man ? '' 
he said with a sigh , and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostov 's eyes . 
Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin 's eyes to Rostov 's and back , and back again and again in an instant . 
`` Come here , '' said Rostov , catching hold of Telyanin 's arm and almost dragging him to the window . 
`` That money is Denisov 's ; you took it ... '' he whispered just above Telyanin 's ear . 
`` What ? 
What ? 
How dare you ? 
What ? '' 
said Telyanin . 
But these words came like a piteous , despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon .
