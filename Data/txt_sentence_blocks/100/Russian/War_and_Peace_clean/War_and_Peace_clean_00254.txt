Was it for this I nursed you ... . 
Ooh ! '' 
`` Do n't , Mary Nikolievna ! '' 
said her husband to her in a low voice , evidently only to justify himself before the stranger . 
`` Sister must have taken her , or else where can she be ? '' 
he added . 
`` Monster ! 
Villain ! '' 
shouted the woman angrily , suddenly ceasing to weep . 
`` You have no heart , you do n't feel for your own child ! 
Another man would have rescued her from the fire . 
But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father ! 
You , honored sir , are a noble man , '' she went on , addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs . 
`` The fire broke out alongside , and blew our way , the maid called out ` Fire ! ' 
and we rushed to collect our things . 
We ran out just as we were ... . 
This is what we have brought away ... . 
The icons , and my dowry bed , all the rest is lost . 
We seized the children . 
But not Katie ! 
Ooh ! 
O Lord ! 
... '' and again she began to sob . 
`` My child , my dear one ! 
Burned , burned ! '' 
`` But where was she left ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her . 
`` Oh , dear sir ! '' 
she cried , seizing him by the legs . 
`` My benefactor , set my heart at ease ... . 
Aniska , go , you horrid girl , show him the way ! '' 
she cried to the maid , angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth . 
`` Show me the way , show me , I. . . 
I 'll do it , '' gasped Pierre rapidly . 
The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk , put up her plait , sighed , and went on her short , bare feet along the path . 
Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon . 
He held his head higher , his eyes shone with the light of life , and with swift steps he followed the maid , overtook her , and came out on the Povarskoy . 
The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke . 
Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud . 
A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration . 
In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him . 
Pierre , accompanied by the maid , was advancing to the spot where the general stood , but the French soldiers stopped him . 
`` On ne passe pas ! '' 
* cried a voice . 
* `` You ca n't pass ! 
`` This way , uncle , '' cried the girl . 
`` We 'll pass through the side street , by the Nikulins ' ! '' 
Pierre turned back , giving a spring now and then to keep up with her . 
She ran across the street , turned down a side street to the left , and , passing three houses , turned into a yard on the right . 
`` It 's here , close by , '' said she and , running across the yard , opened a gate in a wooden fence and , stopping , pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house , which was burning brightly and fiercely . 
One of its sides had fallen in , another was on fire , and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof . 
As Pierre passed through the fence gate , he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped . 
`` Which is it ? 
Which is your house ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Ooh ! '' 
wailed the girl , pointing to the wing . 
`` That 's it , that was our lodging . 
You 've burned to death , our treasure , Katie , my precious little missy ! 
Ooh ! '' 
lamented Aniska , who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings . 
Pierre rushed to the wing , but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end , just below the roof , and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen . 
At first Pierre did not realize what these men , who were dragging something out , were about ; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat , he vaguely understood that looting was going on there , but he had no time to dwell on that idea . 
The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings , the whistle and hiss of the flames , the excited shouts of the people , and the sight of the swaying smoke , now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks , with here and there dense sheaves of flame -LRB- now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls -RRB- , and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion , produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration . 
It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down . 
He felt young , bright , adroit , and resolute . 
He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing , when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him . 
Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest , filled with metal articles . 
Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer . 
`` What does this fellow want ? '' 
shouted one of them referring to Pierre . 
`` There 's a child in that house . 
Have n't you seen a child ? '' 
cried Pierre . 
`` What 's he talking about ? 
Get along ! '' 
said several voices , and one of the soldiers , evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer , moved threateningly toward him . 
`` A child ? '' 
shouted a Frenchman from above . 
`` I did hear something squealing in the garden . 
Perhaps it 's his brat that the fellow is looking for . 
After all , one must be human , you know ... '' `` Where is it ? 
Where ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` There ! 
There ! '' 
shouted the Frenchman at the window , pointing to the garden at the back of the house . 
`` Wait a bit -- I 'm coming down . '' 
And a minute or two later the Frenchman , a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek , in shirt sleeves , really did jump out of a window on the ground floor , and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden . 
`` Hurry up , you others ! '' 
he called out to his comrades . 
`` It 's getting hot . '' 
When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round , graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat . 
`` There is your child ! 
Oh , a girl , so much the better ! '' 
said the Frenchman . 
`` Good-by , Fatty . 
We must be human , we are all mortal you know ! '' 
and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades .
