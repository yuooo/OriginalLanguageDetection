`` You do n't know what love is ... '' `` But , Natasha , can that be all over ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question . 
`` Well , then , are you refusing Prince Andrew ? '' 
said Sonya . 
`` Oh , you do n't understand anything ! 
Do n't talk nonsense , just listen ! '' 
said Natasha , with momentary vexation . 
`` But I ca n't believe it , '' insisted Sonya . 
`` I do n't understand . 
How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly ... Why , you have only seen him three times ! 
Natasha , I do n't believe you , you 're joking ! 
In three days to forget everything and so ... '' `` Three days ? '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It seems to me I 've loved him a hundred years . 
It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before . 
You ca n't understand it ... . 
Sonya , wait a bit , sit here , '' and Natasha embraced and kissed her . 
`` I had heard that it happens like this , and you must have heard it too , but it 's only now that I feel such love . 
It 's not the same as before . 
As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave , and that I could not help loving him . 
Yes , his slave ! 
Whatever he orders I shall do . 
You do n't understand that . 
What can I do ? 
What can I do , Sonya ? '' 
cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened expression . 
`` But think what you are doing , '' cried Sonya . 
`` I ca n't leave it like this . 
This secret correspondence ... How could you let him go so far ? '' 
she went on , with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal . 
`` I told you that I have no will , '' Natasha replied . 
`` Why ca n't you understand ? 
I love him ! '' 
`` Then I wo n't let it come to that ... I shall tell ! '' 
cried Sonya , bursting into tears . 
`` What do you mean ? 
For God 's sake ... If you tell , you are my enemy ! '' 
declared Natasha . 
`` You want me to be miserable , you want us to be separated ... '' When she saw Natasha 's fright , Sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend . 
`` But what has happened between you ? '' 
she asked . 
`` What has he said to you ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
Natasha did not answer her questions . 
`` For God 's sake , Sonya , do n't tell anyone , do n't torture me , '' Natasha entreated . 
`` Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters ! 
I have confided in you ... '' `` But why this secrecy ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
asked Sonya . 
`` Why does n't he openly ask for your hand ? 
You know Prince Andrew gave you complete freedom -- if it is really so ; but I do n't believe it ! 
Natasha , have you considered what these secret reasons can be ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment . 
Evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it . 
`` I do n't know what the reasons are . 
But there must be reasons ! '' 
Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously . 
`` If there were reasons ... '' she began . 
But Natasha , guessing her doubts , interrupted her in alarm . 
`` Sonya , one ca n't doubt him ! 
One ca n't , one ca n't ! 
Do n't you understand ? '' 
she cried . 
`` Does he love you ? '' 
`` Does he love me ? '' 
Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend 's lack of comprehension . 
`` Why , you have read his letter and you have seen him . '' 
`` But if he is dishonorable ? '' 
`` He ! 
dishonorable ? 
If you only knew ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you ; and if you wo n't do this , I will . 
I will write to him , and I will tell Papa ! '' 
said Sonya resolutely . 
`` But I ca n't live without him ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I do n't understand you . 
And what are you saying ! 
Think of your father and of Nicholas . '' 
`` I do n't want anyone , I do n't love anyone but him . 
How dare you say he is dishonorable ? 
Do n't you know that I love him ? '' 
screamed Natasha . 
`` Go away , Sonya ! 
I do n't want to quarrel with you , but go , for God 's sake go ! 
You see how I am suffering ! '' 
Natasha cried angrily , in a voice of despair and repressed irritation . 
Sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room . 
Natasha went to the table and without a moment 's reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning . 
In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end ; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom , she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her , but that she could not be his wife . 
At that moment this all seemed quite easy , simple , and clear to Natasha . 
On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country , but on Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow . 
On the day the count left , Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the Karagins ' , and Marya Dmitrievna took them there . 
At that party Natasha again met Anatole , and Sonya noticed that she spoke to him , trying not to be overheard , and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever . 
When they got home Natasha was the first to begin the explanation Sonya expected . 
`` There , Sonya , you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him , '' Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised . 
`` We have had an explanation today . '' 
`` Well , what happened ? 
What did he say ?
