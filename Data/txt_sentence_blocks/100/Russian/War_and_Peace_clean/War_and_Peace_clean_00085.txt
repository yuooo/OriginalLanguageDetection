That 's a whole long story ! 
How are you going to speak to her -- thou or you ? '' 
`` As may happen , '' said Rostov . 
`` No , call her you , please ! 
I 'll tell you all about it some other time . 
No , I 'll tell you now . 
You know Sonya 's my dearest friend . 
Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake . 
Look here ! '' 
She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long , slender , delicate arm , high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress . 
`` I burned this to prove my love for her . 
I just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there ! '' 
Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms , in what used to be his old schoolroom , and looking into Natasha 's wildly bright eyes , Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else , but gave him some of the best joys of his life ; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless , he understood and was not surprised at it . 
`` Well , and is that all ? '' 
he asked . 
`` We are such friends , such friends ! 
All that ruler business was just nonsense , but we are friends forever . 
She , if she loves anyone , does it for life , but I do n't understand that , I forget quickly . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Well , she loves me and you like that . '' 
Natasha suddenly flushed . 
`` Why , you remember before you went away ? 
... Well , she says you are to forget all that ... . 
She says : ' I shall love him always , but let him be free . ' 
Is n't that lovely and noble ! 
Yes , very noble ? 
Is n't it ? '' 
asked Natasha , so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked of before , with tears . 
Rostov became thoughtful . 
`` I never go back on my word , '' he said . 
`` Besides , Sonya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness . '' 
`` No , no ! '' 
cried Natasha , `` she and I have already talked it over . 
We knew you 'd say so . 
But it wo n't do , because you see , if you say that -- if you consider yourself bound by your promise -- it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously . 
It makes it as if you were marrying her because you must , and that would n't do at all . '' 
Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them . 
Sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day . 
Today , when he had caught a glimpse of her , she seemed still more lovely . 
She was a charming girl of sixteen , evidently passionately in love with him -LRB- he did not doubt that for an instant -RRB- . 
Why should he not love her now , and even marry her , Rostov thought , but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him ! 
`` Yes , they have taken a wise decision , '' he thought , `` I must remain free . '' 
`` Well then , that 's excellent , '' said he . 
`` We 'll talk it over later on . 
Oh , how glad I am to have you ! '' 
`` Well , and are you still true to Boris ? '' 
he continued . 
`` Oh , what nonsense ! '' 
cried Natasha , laughing . 
`` I do n't think about him or anyone else , and I do n't want anything of the kind . '' 
`` Dear me ! 
Then what are you up now ? '' 
`` Now ? '' 
repeated Natasha , and a happy smile lit up her face . 
`` Have you seen Duport ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Not seen Duport -- the famous dancer ? 
Well then , you wo n't understand . 
That 's what I 'm up to . '' 
Curving her arms , Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do , ran back a few steps , turned , cut a caper , brought her little feet sharply together , and made some steps on the very tips of her toes . 
`` See , I 'm standing ! 
See ! '' 
she said , but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer . 
`` So that 's what I 'm up to ! 
I 'll never marry anyone , but will be a dancer . 
Only do n't tell anyone . '' 
Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov , in his bedroom , felt envious and Natasha could not help joining in . 
`` No , but do n't you think it 's nice ? '' 
she kept repeating . 
`` Nice ! 
And so you no longer wish to marry Boris ? '' 
Natasha flared up . 
`` I do n't want to marry anyone . 
And I 'll tell him so when I see him ! '' 
`` Dear me ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` But that 's all rubbish , '' Natasha chattered on . 
`` And is Denisov nice ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Yes , indeed ! '' 
`` Oh , well then , good-by : go and dress . 
Is he very terrible , Denisov ? '' 
`` Why terrible ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` No , Vaska is a splendid fellow . '' 
`` You call him Vaska ? 
That 's funny ! 
And is he very nice ? '' 
`` Very . '' 
`` Well then , be quick . 
We 'll all have breakfast together . '' 
And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe , like a ballet dancer , but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile . 
When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room , he reddened . 
He did not know how to behave with her . 
The evening before , in the first happy moment of meeting , they had kissed each other , but today they felt it could not be done ; he felt that everybody , including his mother and sisters , was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her . 
He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you - Sonya . 
But their eyes met and said thou , and exchanged tender kisses . 
Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared , by Natasha 's intermediacy , to remind him of his promise , and then thanked him for his love . 
His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her , for that would be impossible . 
`` How strange it is , '' said Vera , selecting a moment when all were silent , `` that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers . ''
