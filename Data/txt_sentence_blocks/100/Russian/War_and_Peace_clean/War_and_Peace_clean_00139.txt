Come on ! 
... I was sure of it , '' began `` Uncle . '' 
-LRB- He was a distant relative of the Rostovs ' , a man of small means , and their neighbor . -RRB- 
`` I knew you would n't be able to resist it and it 's a good thing you 're going . 
That 's it ! 
Come on ! 
-LRB- This was `` Uncle 's '' favorite expression . -RRB- 
`` Take the covert at once , for my Girchik says the Ilagins are at Korniki with their hounds . 
That 's it . 
Come on ! 
... They 'll take the cubs from under your very nose . '' 
`` That 's where I 'm going . 
Shall we join up our packs ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
The hounds were joined into one pack , and `` Uncle '' and Nicholas rode on side by side . 
Natasha , muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes , galloped up to them . 
She was followed by Petya who always kept close to her , by Michael , a huntsman , and by a groom appointed to look after her . 
Petya , who was laughing , whipped and pulled at his horse . 
Natasha sat easily and confidently on her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand . 
`` Uncle '' looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha . 
He did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting . 
`` Good morning , Uncle ! 
We are going too ! '' 
shouted Petya . 
`` Good morning , good morning ! 
But do n't go overriding the hounds , '' said `` Uncle '' sternly . 
`` Nicholas , what a fine dog Trunila is ! 
He knew me , '' said Natasha , referring to her favorite hound . 
`` In the first place , Trunila is not a ` dog , ' but a harrier , '' thought Nicholas , and looked sternly at his sister , trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment . 
Natasha understood it . 
`` You must n't think we 'll be in anyone 's way , Uncle , '' she said . 
`` We 'll go to our places and wo n't budge . '' 
`` A good thing too , little countess , '' said `` Uncle , '' `` only mind you do n't fall off your horse , '' he added , `` because -- that 's it , come on ! 
- you 've nothing to hold on to . '' 
The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off , the huntsmen were already nearing it . 
Rostov , having finally settled with `` Uncle '' where they should set on the hounds , and having shown Natasha where she was to stand -- a spot where nothing could possibly run out -- went round above the ravine . 
`` Well , nephew , you 're going for a big wolf , '' said `` Uncle . '' 
`` Mind and do n't let her slip ! '' 
`` That 's as may happen , '' answered Rostov . 
`` Karay , here ! '' 
he shouted , answering `` Uncle 's '' remark by this call to his borzoi . 
Karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl , famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided . 
They all took up their places . 
The old count , knowing his son 's ardor in the hunt , hurried so as not to be late , and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ilya Rostov , cheerful , flushed , and with quivering cheeks , drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him , where a wolf might come out . 
Having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn , he mounted his good , sleek , well-fed , and comfortable horse , Viflyanka , which was turning gray , like himself . 
His horses and trap were sent home . 
Count Ilya Rostov , though not at heart a keen sportsman , knew the rules of the hunt well , and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand , arranged his reins , settled himself in the saddle , and , feeling that he was ready , looked about with a smile . 
Beside him was Simon Chekmar , his personal attendant , an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle . 
Chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds , who had , however , grown fat like their master and his horse . 
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed . 
Some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka , the count 's other groom , a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds . 
Before the hunt , by old custom , the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy , taken a snack , and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux . 
He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive . 
His eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual , and as he sat in his saddle , wrapped up in his fur coat , he looked like a child taken out for an outing . 
The thin , hollow-cheeked Chekmar , having got everything ready , kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years , and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat . 
A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood -LRB- it was plain that he had had a lesson -RRB- and stopped behind the count . 
This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman 's cloak , with a tall peaked cap on his head . 
He was the buffoon , who went by a woman 's name , Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Well , Nastasya Ivanovna ! '' 
whispered the count , winking at him . 
`` If you scare away the beast , Daniel 'll give it you ! '' 
`` I know a thing or two myself ! '' 
said Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Hush ! '' 
whispered the count and turned to Simon . 
`` Have you seen the young countess ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` With young Count Peter , by the Zharov rank grass , '' answered Simon , smiling . 
`` Though she 's a lady , she 's very fond of hunting . '' 
`` And you 're surprised at the way she rides , Simon , eh ? '' 
said the count . 
`` She 's as good as many a man ! '' 
`` Of course ! 
It 's marvelous . 
So bold , so easy ! '' 
`` And Nicholas ? 
Where is he ? 
By the Lyadov upland , is n't he ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . 
He knows where to stand . 
He understands the matter so well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded , '' said Simon , well knowing what would please his master . 
`` Rides well , eh ? 
And how well he looks on his horse , eh ? '' 
`` A perfect picture ! 
How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the Zavarzinsk thicket the other day ! 
Leaped a fearful place ; what a sight when they rushed from the covert ... the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price ! 
Yes , one would have to search far to find another as smart . '' 
`` To search far ... '' repeated the count , evidently sorry Simon had not said more . 
`` To search far , '' he said , turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox . 
`` The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform , Michael Sidorych ... '' Simon did not finish , for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue . 
He bent down his head and listened , shaking a warning finger at his master . 
`` They are on the scent of the cubs ... '' he whispered , `` straight to the Lyadov uplands . '' 
The count , forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face , looked into the distance straight before him , down the narrow open space , holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any . 
After the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel 's hunting horn ; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry , with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf . 
The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds , but changed to the cry of ulyulyu , and above the others rose Daniel 's voice , now a deep bass , now piercingly shrill . 
His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field . 
After listening a few moments in silence , the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs : the sound of the larger pack , eagerly giving tongue , began to die away in the distance , the other pack rushed by the wood past the count , and it was with this that Daniel 's voice was heard calling ulyulyu . 
The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again , but both were becoming more distant . 
Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled ; the count too sighed and , noticing the snuffbox in his hand , opened it and took a pinch .
