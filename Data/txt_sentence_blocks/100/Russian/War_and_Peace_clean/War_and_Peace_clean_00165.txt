`` I 'm not joking , I 'm talking sense . 
Come here , come here ! '' 
Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov , trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily . 
`` Now listen to me . 
I 'm telling you this for the last time . 
Why should I joke about it ? 
Did I hinder you ? 
Who arranged everything for you ? 
Who found the priest and got the passport ? 
Who raised the money ? 
I did it all . '' 
`` Well , thank you for it . 
Do you think I am not grateful ? '' 
And Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov . 
`` I helped you , but all the same I must tell you the truth ; it is a dangerous business , and if you think about it -- a stupid business . 
Well , you 'll carry her off -- all right ! 
Will they let it stop at that ? 
It will come out that you 're already married . 
Why , they 'll have you in the criminal court ... '' `` Oh , nonsense , nonsense ! '' 
Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace . 
`` Did n't I explain to you ? 
What ? '' 
And Anatole , with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning , repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov a hundred times . 
`` Did n't I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion : if this marriage is invalid , '' he went on , crooking one finger , `` then I have nothing to answer for ; but if it is valid , no matter ! 
Abroad no one will know anything about it . 
Is n't that so ? 
And do n't talk to me , do n't , do n't . '' 
`` Seriously , you 'd better drop it ! 
You 'll only get yourself into a mess ! '' 
`` Go to the devil ! '' 
cried Anatole and , clutching his hair , left the room , but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dolokhov with his feet turned under him . 
`` It 's the very devil ! 
What ? 
Feel how it beats ! '' 
He took Dolokhov 's hand and put it on his heart . 
`` What a foot , my dear fellow ! 
What a glance ! 
A goddess ! '' 
he added in French . 
`` What ? '' 
Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him -- evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him . 
`` Well and when the money 's gone , what then ? '' 
`` What then ? 
Eh ? '' 
repeated Anatole , sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future . 
`` What then ? 
... Then , I do n't know ... . 
But why talk nonsense ! '' 
He glanced at his watch . 
`` It 's time ! '' 
Anatole went into the back room . 
`` Now then ! 
Nearly ready ? 
You 're dawdling ! '' 
he shouted to the servants . 
Dolokhov put away the money , called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey , and went into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting . 
Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively , while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself . 
`` Come and eat something . 
Have a drink ! '' 
Dolokhov shouted to him from the other room . 
`` I do n't want to , '' answered Anatole continuing to smile . 
`` Come ! 
Balaga is here . '' 
Anatole rose and went into the dining room . 
Balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas . 
More than once when Anatole 's regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening , brought him to Moscow by daybreak , and driven him back again the next night . 
More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape when pursued . 
More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and `` ladykins '' as he called the cocottes . 
More than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by `` my gentlemen '' as he called them . 
He had ruined more than one horse in their service . 
More than once they had beaten him , and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira , which he loved ; and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia . 
They often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies ' , and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands . 
In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year , and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy . 
But he liked them ; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour , liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian , and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets . 
He liked to hear those wild , tipsy shouts behind him : `` Get on ! 
Get on ! '' 
when it was impossible to go any faster . 
He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who , more dead than alive , was already hurrying out of his way . 
`` Real gentlemen ! '' 
he considered them . 
Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked . 
With others Balaga bargained , charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours ' drive , and rarely drove himself , generally letting his young men do so . 
But with `` his gentlemen '' he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work . 
Only a couple of times a year -- when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand -- he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him . 
The gentlemen always made him sit down . 
`` Do help me out , Theodore Ivanych , sir , '' or `` your excellency , '' he would say . 
`` I am quite out of horses . 
Let me have what you can to go to the fair . '' 
And Anatole and Dolokhov , when they had money , would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles . 
Balaga was a fair-haired , short , and snub-nosed peasant of about twenty-seven ; red-faced , with a particularly red thick neck , glittering little eyes , and a small beard . 
He wore a fine , dark-blue , silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin . 
On entering the room now he crossed himself , turning toward the front corner of the room , and went up to Dolokhov , holding out a small , black hand . 
`` Theodore Ivanych ! '' 
he said , bowing . 
`` How d'you do , friend ? 
Well , here he is ! '' 
`` Good day , your excellency ! '' 
he said , again holding out his hand to Anatole who had just come in . 
`` I say , Balaga , '' said Anatole , putting his hands on the man 's shoulders , `` do you care for me or not ? 
Eh ?
