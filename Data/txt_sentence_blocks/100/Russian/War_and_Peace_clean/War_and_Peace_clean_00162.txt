`` That is perfectly true . 
And I am sorry I went to see him and took her , '' said the old count . 
`` No , why be sorry ? 
Being here , you had to pay your respects . 
But if he wo n't -- that 's his affair , '' said Marya Dmitrievna , looking for something in her reticule . 
`` Besides , the trousseau is ready , so there is nothing to wait for ; and what is not ready I 'll send after you . 
Though I do n't like letting you go , it is the best way . 
So go , with God 's blessing ! '' 
Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to Natasha . 
It was a letter from Princess Mary . 
`` She has written to you . 
How she torments herself , poor thing ! 
She 's afraid you might think that she does not like you . '' 
`` But she does n't like me , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense ! '' 
cried Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` I sha n't believe anyone , I know she does n't like me , '' replied Natasha boldly as she took the letter , and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown . 
`` Do n't answer like that , my good girl ! '' 
she said . 
`` What I say is true ! 
Write an answer ! '' 
Natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary 's letter . 
Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them . 
Whatever her father 's feelings might be , she begged Natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother , for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything . 
`` Do not think , however , '' she wrote , `` that my father is ill-disposed toward you . 
He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven ; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy . '' 
Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time when she could see her again . 
After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it . 
`` Dear Princess , '' she wrote in French quickly and mechanically , and then paused . 
What more could she write after all that had happened the evening before ? 
`` Yes , yes ! 
All that has happened , and now all is changed , '' she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her . 
`` Must I break off with him ? 
Must I really ? 
That 's awful ... '' and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her . 
After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary 's letter . 
`` Can it be that it is all over ? '' 
she thought . 
`` Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before ? '' 
She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength , and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin . 
She vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew 's wife , and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination , and at the same time , aglow with excitement , recalled every detail of yesterday 's interview with Anatole . 
`` Why could that not be as well ? '' 
she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment . 
`` Only so could I be completely happy ; but now I have to choose , and I ca n't be happy without either of them . 
Only , '' she thought , `` to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible . 
But with that one nothing is spoiled . 
But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew 's love , in which I have lived so long ? '' 
`` Please , Miss ! '' 
whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air . 
`` A man told me to give you this - '' and she handed Natasha a letter . 
`` Only , for Christ 's sake ... '' the girl went on , as Natasha , without thinking , mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from Anatole , of which , without taking in a word , she understood only that it was a letter from him -- from the man she loved . 
Yes , she loved him , or else how could that have happened which had happened ? 
And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand ? 
With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter which Dolokhov had composed for Anatole , and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling . 
`` Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed ; to be loved by you or to die . 
There is no other way for me , '' the letter began . 
Then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him -- for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her -- but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes , and no human power could hinder their bliss . 
Love would conquer all . 
He would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth . 
`` Yes , yes ! 
I love him ! '' 
thought Natasha , reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it . 
That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs ' and proposed to take the girls with her . 
Natasha , pleading a headache , remained at home . 
On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha 's room , and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa . 
Open on the table , beside her lay Anatole 's letter . 
Sonya picked it up and read it . 
As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha , trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading , but did not find it . 
Her face was calm , gentle , and happy . 
Clutching her breast to keep herself from choking , Sonya , pale and trembling with fear and agitation , sat down in an armchair and burst into tears . 
`` How was it I noticed nothing ? 
How could it go so far ? 
Can she have left off loving Prince Andrew ? 
And how could she let Kuragin go to such lengths ? 
He is a deceiver and a villain , that 's plain ! 
What will Nicholas , dear noble Nicholas , do when he hears of it ? 
So this is the meaning of her excited , resolute , unnatural look the day before yesterday , yesterday , and today , '' thought Sonya . 
`` But it ca n't be that she loves him ! 
She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from . 
Probably she is offended by it . 
She could not do such a thing ! '' 
Sonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha , again scanning her face . 
`` Natasha ! '' 
she said , just audibly . 
Natasha awoke and saw Sonya . 
`` Ah , you 're back ? '' 
And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening , she embraced her friend , but noticing Sonya 's look of embarrassment , her own face expressed confusion and suspicion . 
`` Sonya , you 've read that letter ? '' 
she demanded . 
`` Yes , '' answered Sonya softly . 
Natasha smiled rapturously . 
`` No , Sonya , I ca n't any longer ! '' 
she said . 
`` I ca n't hide it from you any longer . 
You know , we love one another ! 
Sonya , darling , he writes ... Sonya ... '' Sonya stared open-eyed at Natasha , unable to believe her ears . 
`` And Bolkonski ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Ah , Sonya , if you only knew how happy I am ! '' 
cried Natasha .
