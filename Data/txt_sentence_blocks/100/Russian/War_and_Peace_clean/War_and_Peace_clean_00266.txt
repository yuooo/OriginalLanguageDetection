-LRB- This was Sonya . -RRB- 
Princess Mary ran up the steps . 
`` This way , this way ! '' 
said the girl , with the same artificial smile , and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type , who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion . 
This was the countess . 
She embraced Princess Mary and kissed her . 
`` Mon enfant ! '' 
she muttered , `` je vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps . '' 
* * `` My child ! 
I love you and have known you a long time . '' 
Despite her excitement , Princess Mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her . 
Hardly knowing how she did it , she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her , and asked : `` How is he ? '' 
`` The doctor says that he is not in danger , '' said the countess , but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh , and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words . 
`` Where is he ? 
Can I see him -- can I ? '' 
asked the princess . 
`` One moment , Princess , one moment , my dear ! 
Is this his son ? '' 
said the countess , turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles . 
`` There will be room for everybody , this is a big house . 
Oh , what a lovely boy ! '' 
The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room , where Sonya was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
The countess caressed the boy , and the old count came in and welcomed the princess . 
He had changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him . 
Then he had been a brisk , cheerful , self-assured old man ; now he seemed a pitiful , bewildered person . 
While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing . 
After the destruction of Moscow and of his property , thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life . 
In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible , and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew , the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting , for a time , to this new order of things which she had entered . 
She knew it to be necessary , and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people . 
`` This is my niece , '' said the count , introducing Sonya -- `` You do n't know her , Princess ? '' 
Princess Mary turned to Sonya and , trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl , she kissed her . 
But she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
she asked again , addressing them all . 
`` He is downstairs . 
Natasha is with him , '' answered Sonya , flushing . 
`` We have sent to ask . 
I think you must be tired , Princess . '' 
Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary 's eyes . 
She turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him , when light , impetuous , and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door . 
The princess looked round and saw Natasha coming in , almost running -- that Natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long since . 
But hardly had the princess looked at Natasha 's face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief , and consequently a friend . 
She ran to meet her , embraced her , and began to cry on her shoulder . 
As soon as Natasha , sitting at the head of Prince Andrew 's bed , heard of Princess Mary 's arrival , she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary . 
There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room -- that of love -- boundless love for him , for her , and for all that was near to the man she loved ; and of pity , suffering for others , and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them . 
It was plain that at that moment there was in Natasha 's heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew . 
Princess Mary , with her acute sensibility , understood all this at the first glance at Natasha 's face , and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure . 
`` Come , come to him , Mary , '' said Natasha , leading her into the other room . 
Princess Mary raised her head , dried her eyes , and turned to Natasha . 
She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything . 
`` How ... '' she began her question but stopped short . 
She felt that it was impossible to ask , or to answer , in words . 
Natasha 's face eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly . 
Natasha was gazing at her , but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not ; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart , it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw . 
And suddenly , Natasha 's lips twitched , ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth , and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs . 
Princess Mary understood . 
But she still hoped , and asked , in words she herself did not trust : `` But how is his wound ? 
What is his general condition ? '' 
`` You , you ... will see , '' was all Natasha could say . 
They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces . 
`` How has his whole illness gone ? 
Is it long since he grew worse ? 
When did this happen ? '' 
Princess Mary inquired . 
Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered , but at Troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene . 
That danger had also passed . 
When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester -LRB- Natasha knew all about such things as festering -RRB- and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course . 
Then fever set in , but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious . 
`` But two days ago this suddenly happened , '' said Natasha , struggling with her sobs . 
`` I do n't know why , but you will see what he is like . '' 
`` Is he weaker ? 
Thinner ? '' 
asked the princess . 
`` No , it 's not that , but worse . 
You will see . 
O , Mary , he is too good , he can not , can not live , because ... '' When Natasha opened Prince Andrew 's door with a familiar movement and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her , the princess felt the sobs in her throat . 
Hard as she had tried to prepare herself , and now tried to remain tranquil , she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears . 
The princess understood what Natasha had meant by the words : `` two days ago this suddenly happened . '' 
She understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death . 
As she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination Andrew 's face as she remembered it in childhood , a gentle , mild , sympathetic face which he had rarely shown , and which therefore affected her very strongly . 
She was sure he would speak soft , tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death , and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence . 
Yet sooner or later it had to be , and she went in . 
The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features , and then she saw his face and met his gaze . 
He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan , surrounded by pillows . 
He was thin and pale . 
In one thin , translucently white hand he held a handkerchief , while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown , moving his fingers slowly . 
His eyes gazed at them as they entered . 
On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary 's pace suddenly slackened , she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased . 
She suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes . 
`` But in what am I to blame ? '' 
she asked herself . 
And his cold , stern look replied : `` Because you are alive and thinking of the living , while I. . . '' 
In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and Natasha . 
He kissed his sister , holding her hand in his as was their wont . 
`` How are you , Mary ? 
How did you manage to get here ? '' 
said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look . 
Had he screamed in agony , that scream would not have struck such horror into Princess Mary 's heart as the tone of his voice . 
`` And have you brought little Nicholas ? '' 
he asked in the same slow , quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember .
