Natasha too , with her quick instinct , had instantly noticed her brother 's condition . 
But , though she noticed it , she was herself in such high spirits at that moment , so far from sorrow , sadness , or self-reproach , that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do . 
`` No , I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone 's sorrow , '' she felt , and she said to herself : `` No , I must be mistaken , he must be feeling happy , just as I am . '' 
`` Now , Sonya ! '' 
she said , going to the very middle of the room , where she considered the resonance was best . 
Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly , as ballet dancers do , Natasha , rising energetically from her heels to her toes , stepped to the middle of the room and stood still . 
`` Yes , that 's me ! '' 
she seemed to say , answering the rapt gaze with which Denisov followed her . 
`` And what is she so pleased about ? '' 
thought Nicholas , looking at his sister . 
`` Why is n't she dull and ashamed ? '' 
Natasha took the first note , her throat swelled , her chest rose , her eyes became serious . 
At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings , and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same intervals hold for the same time , but which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep . 
Natasha , that winter , had for the first time begun to sing seriously , mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing . 
She no longer sang as a child , there was no longer in her singing that comical , childish , painstaking effect that had been in it before ; but she did not yet sing well , as all the connoisseurs who heard her said : `` It is not trained , but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained . '' 
Only they generally said this some time after she had finished singing . 
While that untrained voice , with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions , was sounding , even the connoisseurs said nothing , but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again . 
In her voice there was a virginal freshness , an unconsciousness of her own powers , and an as yet untrained velvety softness , which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it . 
`` What is this ? '' 
thought Nicholas , listening to her with widely opened eyes . 
`` What has happened to her ? 
How she is singing today ! '' 
And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note , the next phrase , and everything in the world was divided into three beats : `` Oh mio crudele affetto . '' 
... One , two , three ... one , two , three ... One ... `` Oh mio crudele affetto . '' 
... One , two , three ... One . 
`` Oh , this senseless life of ours ! '' 
thought Nicholas . 
`` All this misery , and money , and Dolokhov , and anger , and honor -- it 's all nonsense ... but this is real ... . 
Now then , Natasha , now then , dearest ! 
Now then , darling ! 
How will she take that si ? 
She 's taken it ! 
Thank God ! '' 
And without noticing that he was singing , to strengthen the si he sung a second , a third below the high note . 
`` Ah , God ! 
How fine ! 
Did I really take it ? 
How fortunate ! '' 
he thought . 
Oh , how that chord vibrated , and how moved was something that was finest in Rostov 's soul ! 
And this something was apart from everything else in the world and above everything in the world . 
`` What were losses , and Dolokhov , and words of honor ? 
... All nonsense ! 
One might kill and rob and yet be happy ... '' It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that day . 
But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself . 
He got up without saying a word and went downstairs to his own room . 
A quarter of an hour later the old count came in from his Club , cheerful and contented . 
Nicholas , hearing him drive up , went to meet him . 
`` Well -- had a good time ? '' 
said the old count , smiling gaily and proudly at his son . 
Nicholas tried to say `` Yes , '' but could not : and he nearly burst into sobs . 
The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son 's condition . 
`` Ah , it ca n't be avoided ! '' 
thought Nicholas , for the first and last time . 
And suddenly , in the most casual tone , which made him feel ashamed feel of himself , he said , as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town : `` Papa , I have come on a matter of business . 
I was nearly forgetting . 
I need some money . '' 
`` Dear me ! '' 
said his father , who was in a specially good humor . 
`` I told you it would not be enough . 
How much ? '' 
`` Very much , '' said Nicholas flushing , and with a stupid careless smile , for which he was long unable to forgive himself , `` I have lost a little , I mean a good deal , a great deal -- forty three thousand . '' 
`` What ! 
To whom ? 
... Nonsense ! '' 
cried the count , suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do . 
`` I promised to pay tomorrow , '' said Nicholas . 
`` Well ! 
... '' said the old count , spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa . 
`` It ca n't be helped It happens to everyone ! '' 
said the son , with a bold , free , and easy tone , while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime . 
He longed to kiss his father 's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness , but said , in a careless and even rude voice , that it happens to everyone ! 
The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son 's words and began bustlingly searching for something . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he muttered , `` it will be difficult , I fear , difficult to raise ... happens to everybody ! 
Yes , who has not done it ? '' 
And with a furtive glance at his son 's face , the count went out of the room ... . 
Nicholas had been prepared for resistance , but had not at all expected this . 
`` Papa ! 
Pa-pa ! '' 
he called after him , sobbing , `` forgive me ! '' 
And seizing his father 's hand , he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears . 
While father and son were having their explanation , the mother and daughter were having one not less important . 
Natasha came running to her mother , quite excited . 
`` Mamma ! 
... Mamma ! 
... He has made me ... '' `` Made what ? '' 
`` Made , made me an offer , Mamma ! 
Mamma ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
The countess did not believe her ears . 
Denisov had proposed . 
To whom ? 
To this chit of a girl , Natasha , who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons . 
`` Do n't , Natasha ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
she said , hoping it was a joke . 
`` Nonsense , indeed ! 
I am telling you the fact , '' said Natasha indignantly . 
`` I come to ask you what to do , and you call it ` nonsense ! ' '' 
The countess shrugged her shoulders .
