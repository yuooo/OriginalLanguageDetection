To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch-coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and can not freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing -LRB- like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter -RRB- ; so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you .
