Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow 's - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow 's - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the `` local attraction '' of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship 's planks , and in the Glacier 's case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned `` binnacle deviations , '' `` azimuth compass observations , '' and `` approximate errors , '' he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow 's nest , within easy reach of his hand .
