For when Jonah , not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts , -- when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship .
