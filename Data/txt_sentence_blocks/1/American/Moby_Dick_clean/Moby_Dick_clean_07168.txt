To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber .
