One morning , when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw , we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show .
