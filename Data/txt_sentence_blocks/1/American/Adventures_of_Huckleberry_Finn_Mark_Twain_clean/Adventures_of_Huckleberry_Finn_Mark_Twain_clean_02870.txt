I would thou couldst ; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , The law 's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take , In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i ' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care , And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action .
