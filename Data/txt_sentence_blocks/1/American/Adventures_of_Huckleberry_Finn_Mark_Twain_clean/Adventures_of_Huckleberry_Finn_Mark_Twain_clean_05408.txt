The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but had n't got no answer , because there war n't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and I see we had n't no time to lose .
