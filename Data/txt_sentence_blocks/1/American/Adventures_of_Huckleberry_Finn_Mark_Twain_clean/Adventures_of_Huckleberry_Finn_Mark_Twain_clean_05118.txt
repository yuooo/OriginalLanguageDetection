So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard , where they keep the old boots , and rags , and pieces of bottles , and wore-out tin things , and all such truck , and scratched around and found an old tin washpan , and stopped up the holes as well as we could , to bake the pie in , and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast , and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with , and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally 's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair , and t ` other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas 's hat , which was on the bureau , because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger 's house this morning , and then went to breakfast , and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas 's coat-pocket , and Aunt Sally was n't come yet , so we had to wait a little while .
