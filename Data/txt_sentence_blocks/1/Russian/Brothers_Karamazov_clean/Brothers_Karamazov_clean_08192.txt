Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere , just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye , and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it , yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realises , and removes the offending object , often quite a trifling and ridiculous one - some article left about in the wrong place , a handkerchief on the floor , a book not replaced on the shelf , and so on .
