Let me tell you , stupid , that we here are all of little faith , only from carelessness , because we have n't time ; things are too much for us , and , in the second place , the Lord God has given us so little time , only twenty-four hours in the day , so that one has n't even time to get sleep enough , much less to repent of one 's sins .
