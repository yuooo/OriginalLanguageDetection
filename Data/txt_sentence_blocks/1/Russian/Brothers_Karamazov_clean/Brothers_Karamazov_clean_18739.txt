there are sort of little tails , the little tails of those nerves , and as soon as they begin quivering ... that is , you see , I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering , those little tails ... and when they quiver , then an image appears ... it does n't appear at once , but an instant , a second , passes ... and then something like a moment appears ; that is , not a moment - devil take the moment !
