This novitiate , this terrible school of abnegation , is undertaken voluntarily , in the hope of self-conquest , of self-mastery , in order , after a life of obedience , to attain perfect freedom , that is , from self ; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves in themselves .
