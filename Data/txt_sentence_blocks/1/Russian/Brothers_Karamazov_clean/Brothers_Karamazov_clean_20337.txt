For if a man had known all about it , as I did for instance , if he 'd seen those notes before , and perhaps had put them in that envelope himself , and had seen the envelope sealed up and addressed , with his own eyes , if such a man had done the murder , what should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards , especially in such desperate haste , since he 'd know for certain the notes must be in the envelope ?
