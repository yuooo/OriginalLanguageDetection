I bless the rising sun each day , and , as before , my heart sings to meet it , but now I love even more its setting , its long slanting rays and the soft , tender , gentle memories that come with them , the dear images from the whole of my long , happy life - and over all the Divine Truth , softening , reconciling , forgiving !
