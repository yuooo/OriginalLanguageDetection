`` It is not enough for me to know what I have in me -- everyone must know it : Pierre , and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky , everyone must know me , so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it , but so that it may be reflected in them all , and they and I may live in harmony ! ''
