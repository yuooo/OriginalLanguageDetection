Every army is composed of lower grades of the service -- the rank and file -- of whom there are always the greatest number ; of the next higher military rank -- corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer , and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer , and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person .
