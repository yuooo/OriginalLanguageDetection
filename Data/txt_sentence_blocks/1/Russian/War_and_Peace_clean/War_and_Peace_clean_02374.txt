As to the last meeting between father and son , it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears , and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments -- the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son , or Pierre , whom it had been pitiful to see , so stricken was he with grief , though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father .
