By a strange coincidence , this task , which turned out to be a most difficult and important one , was entrusted to Dokhturov -- that same modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles , dashing about in front of regiments , showering crosses on batteries , and so on , and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning -- but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813 .
