Create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us , strengthen us all in Thy faith , fortify our hope , inspire us with true love one for another , arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers , and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified .
