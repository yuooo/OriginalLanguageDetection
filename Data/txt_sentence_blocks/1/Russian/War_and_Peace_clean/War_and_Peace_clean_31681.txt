To these questions three answers are possible : Either to assume -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen , and that therefore every emergence of a new power , every struggle against the power once appointed , should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally , under definite and known conditions , and to show that all limitations , conflicts , and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally , but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite , and that the appearance of several authorities , their struggles and their falls , result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others .
