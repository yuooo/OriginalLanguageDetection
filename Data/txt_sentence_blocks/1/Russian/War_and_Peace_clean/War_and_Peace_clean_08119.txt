On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling , while his grandson , with shirt sleeves rolled up , handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can , on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts -- on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon , under the horses ' hoofs and between the wagon wheels , men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together , crushing one another , dying , stepping over the dying and killing one another , only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way .
