Each instrument -- now resembling a violin and now a horn , but better and clearer than violin or horn - played its own part , and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air , and then with a third and a fourth ; and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended , now into solemn church music , now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant .
