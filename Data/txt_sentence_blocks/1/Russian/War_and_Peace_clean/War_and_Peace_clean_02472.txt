I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance ; but I do know that since this young man , whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre , has become Count Bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia , I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters , and of the young ladies themselves , toward him , though , between you and me , he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow .
