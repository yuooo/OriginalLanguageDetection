I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy 's ranks , but should victory be in doubt , even for a moment , you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy , for there must be no doubt of victory , especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry , so necessary to the honor of our nation .
