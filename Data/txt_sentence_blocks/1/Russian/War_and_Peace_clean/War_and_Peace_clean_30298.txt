We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European convulsions and that we know only the facts -- that is , the murders , first in France , then in Italy , in Africa , in Prussia , in Austria , in Spain , and in Russia -- and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events , and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander , but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men , and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were , but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable .
