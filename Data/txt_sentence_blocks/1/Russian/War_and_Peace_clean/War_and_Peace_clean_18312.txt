`` O Lord our God , in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust , let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy , and give us a token of Thy blessing , that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish , and may all the nations know that Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people .
