And tomorrow I shall be killed , perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men , by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday , and the French will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses , and new conditions of life will arise , which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing .
