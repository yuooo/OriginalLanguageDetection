The ocean defends the water , the hurricane defends the air , the King defends Royalty , the democracy defends the people ; the relative , which is the monarchy , resists the absolute , which is the republic ; society bleeds in this conflict , but that which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety later on ; and , in any case , those who combat are not to be blamed ; one of the two parties is evidently mistaken ; the right is not , like the Colossus of Rhodes , on two shores at once , with one foot on the republic , and one in Royalty ; it is indivisible , and all on one side ; but those who are in error are so sincerely ; a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian .
