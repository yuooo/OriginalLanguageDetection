Marius related the adventure to him : That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight , was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening ; that , as he occupied the room adjoining the den , he , Marius Pontmercy , a lawyer , had heard the whole plot through the partition ; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette ; that there would be accomplices , probably some prowlers of the barriers , among others a certain Panchaud , alias Printanier , alias Bigrenaille ; that Jondrette 's daughters were to lie in wait ; that there was no way of warning the threatened man , since he did not even know his name ; and that , finally , all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening , at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital , in house No. 50-52 .
