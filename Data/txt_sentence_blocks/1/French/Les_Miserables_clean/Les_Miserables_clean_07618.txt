As for us , we leave the historians at loggerheads ; we are but a distant witness , a passer-by on the plain , a seeker bending over that soil all made of human flesh , taking appearances for realities , perchance ; we have no right to oppose , in the name of science , a collection of facts which contain illusions , no doubt ; we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorize a system ; in our opinion , a chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo ; and when it becomes a question of destiny , that mysterious culprit , we judge like that ingenious judge , the populace .
