To attempt , to brave , to persist , to persevere , to be faithful to one 's self , to grasp fate bodily , to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us , now to affront unjust power , again to insult drunken victory , to hold one 's position , to stand one 's ground ; that is the example which nations need , that is the light which electrifies them .
