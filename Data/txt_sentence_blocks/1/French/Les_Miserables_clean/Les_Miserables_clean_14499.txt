There existed in that light and that shadow , a complete little new and old world , comic and sad , juvenile and senile , which was rubbing its eyes ; nothing resembles an awakening like a return ; a group which regarded France with ill-temper , and which France regarded with irony ; good old owls of marquises by the streetful , who had returned , and of ghosts , the `` former '' subjects of amazement at everything , brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in France but wept also , delighted to behold their country once more , in despair at not finding their monarchy ; the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire , that is to say , the nobility of the sword , with scorn ; historic races who had lost the sense of history ; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon .
