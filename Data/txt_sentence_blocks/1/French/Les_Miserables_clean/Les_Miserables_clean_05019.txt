Madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor , anger , nor distrust ; he halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor 's arm-chair , and there he stood , perfectly erect , in an attitude almost of discipline , with the cold , ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient ; he waited without uttering a word , without making a movement , in genuine humility and tranquil resignation , calm , serious , hat in hand , with eyes cast down , and an expression which was half-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge , until it should please the mayor to turn round .
