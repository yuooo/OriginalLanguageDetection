That moon in the sky , that slumbering nature , that garden without a quiver , that house which was so calm , the hour , the moment , the silence , added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man , and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair , those closed eyes , that face in which all was hope and all was confidence , that head of an old man , and that slumber of an infant .
