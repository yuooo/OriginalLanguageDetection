The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent , has not yet sounded for him ; the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king ; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict ; Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called the 221 and 1830 , that is to say , by a half-Parliament , and a half-revolution ; and in any case , from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself , we can not judge him here , as the reader has seen above , except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle ; in the eyes of the absolute , outside these two rights , the right of man in the first place , the right of the people in the second , all is usurpation ; but what we can say , even at the present day , that after making these reserves is , that to sum up the whole , and in whatever manner he is considered , Louis Philippe , taken in himself , and from the point of view of human goodness , will remain , to use the antique language of ancient history , one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne .
