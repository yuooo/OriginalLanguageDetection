Sister Perpetue was a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise , who chattered her patois , droned , grumbled , sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid , treated her patients abruptly , roughly , was crabbed with the dying , almost flung God in their faces , stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage ; was bold , honest , and ruddy .
