The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek : no one sleeps more soundly than he , no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he , no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness ; let him not be trusted nevertheless ; he is ready for any sort of cool deed ; but when there is glory at the end of it , he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury .
