There comes an hour , nevertheless , when the gale breaks that sixty-foot yard like a straw , when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall , when that anchor , which weighs tens of thousands , is twisted in the jaws of the waves like a fisherman 's hook in the jaws of a pike , when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars , which the hurricane bears forth into the void and into night , when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior .
