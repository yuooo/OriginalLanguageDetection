In Floreal -LSB- 34 -RSB- this enormous thicket , free behind its gate and within its four walls , entered upon the secret labor of germination , quivered in the rising sun , almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love , and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins , and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks , sprinkled on the damp earth , on the defaced statues , on the crumbling steps of the pavilion , and even on the pavement of the deserted street , flowers like stars , dew like pearls , fecundity , beauty , life , joy , perfumes .
