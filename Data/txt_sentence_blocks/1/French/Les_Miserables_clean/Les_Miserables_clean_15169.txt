They assembled in Paris in two localities , near the fish-market , in a wine-shop called Corinthe , of which more will be heard later on , and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe Musain , now torn down ; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman , the second to the students .
