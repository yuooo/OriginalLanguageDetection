A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had , in fact , at the very first instant , hastened to the officer of the watch , and , in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew , while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back , he had asked the officer 's permission to risk his life to save the topman ; at an affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer , then he had caught up a rope , and had dashed into the rigging : no one noticed , at the instant , with what ease that chain had been broken ; it was only later on that the incident was recalled .
