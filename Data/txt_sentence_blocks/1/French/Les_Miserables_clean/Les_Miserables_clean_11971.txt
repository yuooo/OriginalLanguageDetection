Superstitions , bigotries , affected devotion , prejudices , those forms all forms as they are , are tenacious of life ; they have teeth and nails in their smoke , and they must be clasped close , body to body , and war must be made on them , and that without truce ; for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms .
