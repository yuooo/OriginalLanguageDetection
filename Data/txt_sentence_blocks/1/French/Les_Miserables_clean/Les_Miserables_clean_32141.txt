A pile of Cassandras , Harlequins and Columbines , jolted along high above the passers-by , all possible grotesquenesses , from the Turk to the savage , Hercules supporting Marquises , fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears just as the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his eyes , tow wigs , pink tights , dandified hats , spectacles of a grimacer , three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly , shouts directed at pedestrians , fists on hips , bold attitudes , bare shoulders , immodesty unchained ; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers ; this is what that institution was like .
