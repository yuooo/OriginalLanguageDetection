In short , one day , M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres , abdicated the functions of warden , gave up Saint-Sulpice , sold not a part of his books , but of his prints , -- that to which he was the least attached , -- and installed himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse , where , however , he remained but one quarter for two reasons : in the first place , the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs , and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent ; in the second , being near Faton 's shooting-gallery , he could hear the pistol-shots ; which was intolerable to him .
