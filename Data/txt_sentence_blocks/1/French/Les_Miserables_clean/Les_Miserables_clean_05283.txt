Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words , in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude : `` They shall have for their convent only the house of the sick ; for cell only a hired room ; for chapel only their parish church ; for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals ; for enclosure only obedience ; for gratings only the fear of God ; for veil only modesty . ''
