This rough , squat , heavy , hard , austere , almost misshapen , but assuredly majestic monument , stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity , has disappeared , and left to reign in peace , a sort of gigantic stove , ornamented with its pipe , which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers , very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes .
