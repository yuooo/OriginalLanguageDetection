ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this epoch , and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge , which will soon be succeeded , let us hope , by some hideous iron cable bridge , might have observed , had he dropped his eyes over the parapet , a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap , and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth , to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon , was sewn , shod with wooden sabots , tanned by the sun , his face nearly black and his hair nearly white , a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek , bowed , bent , prematurely aged , who walked nearly every day , hoe and sickle in hand , in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge , and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces , charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say , were they much larger : `` these are gardens , '' and were they a little smaller : `` these are bouquets .
