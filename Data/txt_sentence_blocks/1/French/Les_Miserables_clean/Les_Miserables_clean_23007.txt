The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine , after passing the barracks of the firemen , in front of the porte-cochere of the bathing establishment , beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes , at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings , brightened up with green shutters , the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques .
