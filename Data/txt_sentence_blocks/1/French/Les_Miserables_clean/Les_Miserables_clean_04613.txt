These are beings of the great neuter species : impotent men , parasites , cyphers , who have a little land , a little folly , a little wit ; who would be rustics in a drawing-room , and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop ; who say , `` My fields , my peasants , my woods '' ; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste ; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war ; hunt , smoke , yawn , drink , smell of tobacco , play billiards , stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence , live at the cafe , dine at the inn , have a dog which eats the bones under the table , and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table ; who stick at a sou , exaggerate the fashions , admire tragedy , despise women , wear out their old boots , copy London through Paris , and Paris through the medium of Pont-A-Mousson , grow old as dullards , never work , serve no use , and do no great harm .
