Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap , a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck , the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house , a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff , with large , short sleeves , an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks , knotted round the waist with a green ribbon , with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners , coarse shoes on her feet , and yellow stockings , like the women of Marseilles .
