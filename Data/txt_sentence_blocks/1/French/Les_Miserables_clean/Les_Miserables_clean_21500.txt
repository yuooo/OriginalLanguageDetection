Twenty-four on each vehicle , twelve on a side , back to back , facing the passers-by , their legs dangling in the air , -- this was the manner in which these men were travelling , and behind their backs they had something which clanked , and which was a chain , and on their necks something which shone , and which was an iron collar .
