In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living , the mayor and his scarf , the priest and his chasuble , the law and God no longer suffice ; they must be eked out by the Postilion de Lonjumeau ; a blue waistcoat turned up with red , and with bell buttons , a plaque like a vantbrace , knee-breeches of green leather , oaths to the Norman horses with their tails knotted up , false galloons , varnished hat , long powdered locks , an enormous whip and tall boots .
