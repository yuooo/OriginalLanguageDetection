brave as a grenadier , courageous as a thinker ; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up , and unfitted for great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life , never his work ; disguising his will in influence , in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king ; endowed with observation and not with divination ; not very attentive to minds , but knowing men , that is to say requiring to see in order to judge ; prompt and penetrating good sense , practical wisdom , easy speech , prodigious memory ; drawing incessantly on this memory , his only point of resemblance with Caesar , Alexander , and Napoleon ; knowing deeds , facts , details , dates , proper names , ignorant of tendencies , passions , the diverse geniuses of the crowd , the interior aspirations , the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls , in a word , all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences ; accepted by the surface , but little in accord with France lower down ; extricating himself by dint of tact ; governing too much and not enough ; his own first minister ; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas ; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization , of order and organization , an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery , the founder and lawyer of a dynasty ; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney ; in short , a lofty and original figure , a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France , and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe .
