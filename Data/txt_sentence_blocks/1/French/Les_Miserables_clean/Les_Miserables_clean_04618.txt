At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar , a big cravat , a watch with trinkets , three vests of different colors , worn one on top of the other -- the red and blue inside ; of a short-waisted olive coat , with a codfish tail , a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder ; and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive , ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite , but always uneven , number of lines , varying from one to eleven -- a limit which was never exceeded .
