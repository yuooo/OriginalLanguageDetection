It was evident that to-morrow , that an hour hence , a pouring rain might descend , that it might be followed by another and another , and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched , that once soaked , these men would not get dry again , that once chilled , they would not again get warm , that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour , that the water would fill their shoes , that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering , that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck , that their legs would continue to dangle , and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn , and delivered over to the rain , to the blast , to all the furies of the air , like trees and stones .
