Bahorel was a good-natured mortal , who kept bad company , brave , a spendthrift , prodigal , and to the verge of generosity , talkative , and at times eloquent , bold to the verge of effrontery ; the best fellow possible ; he had daring waistcoats , and scarlet opinions ; a wholesale blusterer , that is to say , loving nothing so much as a quarrel , unless it were an uprising ; and nothing so much as an uprising , unless it were a revolution ; always ready to smash a window-pane , then to tear up the pavement , then to demolish a government , just to see the effect of it ; a student in his eleventh year .
