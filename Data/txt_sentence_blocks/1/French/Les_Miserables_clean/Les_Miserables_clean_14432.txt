With these phantoms , priests were sometimes mingled , frequenters of this ancient salon , and some gentlemen ; the Marquis de Sass **** , private secretary to Madame de Berry , the Vicomte de Val *** , who published , under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine , monorhymed odes , the Prince de Beauff ******* , who , though very young , had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife , whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows , the Marquis de C ***** d' E ****** , the man in all France who best understood `` proportioned politeness , '' the Comte d'Am ***** , the kindly man with the amiable chin , and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy , a pillar of the library of the Louvre , called the King 's cabinet , M. de Port-de-Guy , bald , and rather aged than old , was wont to relate that in 1793 , at the age of sixteen , he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian , the Bishop of Mirepoix , also refractory , but as a priest , while he was so in the capacity of a soldier .
