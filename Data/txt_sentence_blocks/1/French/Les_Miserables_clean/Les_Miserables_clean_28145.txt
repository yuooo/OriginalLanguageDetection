On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished , and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimaera of antiquity , the hydra , the dragon and the griffin , he will be the master of water , fire , and of air , and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him .
