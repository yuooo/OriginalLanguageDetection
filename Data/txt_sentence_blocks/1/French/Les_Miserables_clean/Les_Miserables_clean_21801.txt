He goes down stairs ; you will tear up your sheets , little by little you will make of them a rope , then you will climb out of your window , and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss , and it will be night , amid storm , rain , and the hurricane , and if the rope is too short , but one way of descending will remain to you , to fall .
