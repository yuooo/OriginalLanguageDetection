cried the musketeer , `` only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across plowed lands ; there is but one Fouquet , a financier , to ride thus in open day upon a white horse ; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make his escape towards the sea , while there are such thick forests on land , and there is but one D'Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet , who has half an hour 's start , and who will have gained his boat within an hour . ''
