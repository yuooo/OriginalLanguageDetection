The king issued from an infancy imprisoned like yours , obscure as yours , and confined as yours ; only , instead of ending , like yourself , this slavery in a prison , this obscurity in solitude , these straightened circumstances in concealment , he was fain to bear all these miseries , humiliations , and distresses , in full daylight , under the pitiless sun of royalty ; on an elevation flooded with light , where every stain appears a blemish , every glory a stain .
