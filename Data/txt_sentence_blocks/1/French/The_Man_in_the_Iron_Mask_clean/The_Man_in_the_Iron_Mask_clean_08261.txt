I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone , because I am ambitious , and , above all , because I have the most entire confidence in my own merit ; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes , and I love to look at the king 's gold ; because , if I live thirty years , in thirty years not a denir of it will remain in my hands ; because , with that gold , I will build granaries , castles , cities , and harbors ; because I will create a marine , I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people ; because I will create libraries and academies ; because I will make France the first country in the world , and the wealthiest .
