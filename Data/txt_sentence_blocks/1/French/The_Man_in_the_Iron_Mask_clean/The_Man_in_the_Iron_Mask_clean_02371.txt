Never shall I act except in such a manner that you will be the gainer ; I shall never ascend the ladder of fortune , fame , or position , until I have first seen you placed upon the round of the ladder immediately above me ; I shall always hold myself sufficiently aloof from you to escape incurring your jealousy , sufficiently near to sustain your personal advantage and to watch over your friendship .
