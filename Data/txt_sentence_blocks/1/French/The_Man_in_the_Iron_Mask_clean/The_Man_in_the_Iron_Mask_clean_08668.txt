`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth .
