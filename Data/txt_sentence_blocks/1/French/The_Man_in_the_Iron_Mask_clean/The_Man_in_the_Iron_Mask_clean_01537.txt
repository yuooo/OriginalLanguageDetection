La Fontaine placed himself at a table , and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white vellum ; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue ; Moliere contributed fifty fresh verses , with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him ; Loret , an article on the marvelous fetes he predicted ; and Aramis , laden with his booty like the king of the bees , that great black drone , decked with purple and gold , re-entered his apartment , silent and busy .
