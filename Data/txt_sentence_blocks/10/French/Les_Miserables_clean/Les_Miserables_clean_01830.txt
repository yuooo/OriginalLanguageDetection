Marius had five hours before him . 
There was but one thing to be done . 
He put on his decent coat , knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck , took his hat , and went out , without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet . 
Moreover , the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron . 
Once outside of the house , he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
He had almost reached the middle of this street , near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points , and which abuts on a waste space , and was walking slowly , in consequence of his preoccupied condition , and the snow deadened the sound of his steps ; all at once he heard voices talking very close by . 
He turned his head , the street was deserted , there was not a soul in it , it was broad daylight , and yet he distinctly heard voices . 
It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting . 
There , in fact , sat two men , flat on the snow , with their backs against the wall , talking together in subdued tones . 
These two persons were strangers to him ; one was a bearded man in a blouse , and the other a long-haired individual in rags .
