`` Hush ! 
hush ! '' 
said Jean Valjean in a low voice . 
`` Why tell all that ? '' 
`` But you ! '' 
cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration , `` why did you not tell it to me ? 
It is your own fault , too . 
You save people 's lives , and you conceal it from them ! 
You do more , under the pretext of unmasking yourself , you calumniate yourself . 
It is frightful . ''
