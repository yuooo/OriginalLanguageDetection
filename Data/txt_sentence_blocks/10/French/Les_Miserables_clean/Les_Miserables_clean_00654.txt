He had almost forgotten that door . 
His glance , calm at first , paused there , remained fixed on that brass handle , then grew terrified , and little by little became impregnated with fear . 
Beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples . 
At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion , which is intended to convey , and which does so well convey , `` Pardieu ! 
who compels me to this ? '' 
Then he wheeled briskly round , caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him , went to it , opened it , and passed out . 
He was no longer in that chamber ; he was outside in a corridor , a long , narrow corridor , broken by steps and gratings , making all sorts of angles , lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids , the corridor through which he had approached . 
He breathed , he listened ; not a sound in front , not a sound behind him , and he fled as though pursued . 
When he had turned many angles in this corridor , he still listened . 
The same silence reigned , and there was the same darkness around him .
