`` Yes , '' replied Javert . 
The six pinioned ruffians were standing , and still preserved their spectral mien ; all three besmeared with black , all three masked . 
`` Keep on your masks , '' said Javert . 
And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II . 
at a Potsdam parade , he said to the three `` chimney-builders '' : -- `` Good day , Bigrenaille ! 
good day , Brujon ! 
good day , Deuxmilliards ! '' 
Then turning to the three masked men , he said to the man with the meat-axe : -- `` Good day , Gueulemer ! '' 
And to the man with the cudgel : -- `` Good day , Babet ! '' 
And to the ventriloquist : -- `` Your health , Claquesous . ''
