They furnished the canvas to the four rascals , and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery . 
They labored at the stage setting . 
They were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder , and which were sufficiently lucrative . 
When a crime was in quest of arms , they under-let their accomplices . 
They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies . 
They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall , the hour when they woke up , on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere .

Patron-Minette , -- such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men . 
In the fantastic , ancient , popular parlance , which is vanishing day by day , Patron-Minette signifies the morning , the same as entre chien et loup -- between dog and wolf -- signifies the evening .
