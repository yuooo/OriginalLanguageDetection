It was rallying , but hiding itself . 
The Emperor half rose in his stirrups . 
The lightning of victory flashed from his eyes . 
Wellington , driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes and destroyed -- that was the definitive conquest of England by France ; it was Crecy , Poitiers , Malplaquet , and Ramillies avenged . 
The man of Marengo was wiping out Agincourt . 
So the Emperor , meditating on this terrible turn of fortune , swept his glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle . 
His guard , standing behind him with grounded arms , watched him from below with a sort of religion . 
He pondered ; he examined the slopes , noted the declivities , scrutinized the clumps of trees , the square of rye , the path ; he seemed to be counting each bush . 
He gazed with some intentness at the English barricades of the two highways , -- two large abatis of trees , that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte , armed with two cannon , the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle , and that on the road to Nivelles where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chasse 's brigade . 
Near this barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas , painted white , which stands at the angle of the cross-road near Braine-l'Alleud ; he bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste .
