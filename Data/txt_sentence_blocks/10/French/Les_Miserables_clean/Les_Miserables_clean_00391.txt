That was all that could be said about him . 
Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably re-constructed , M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade . 
Spain , which consumes a good deal of black jet , made enormous purchases there each year . 
M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this branch of commerce . 
Father Madeleine 's profits were such , that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory , in which there were two vast workrooms , one for the men , and the other for women . 
Any one who was hungry could present himself there , and was sure of finding employment and bread . 
Father Madeleine required of the men good will , of the women pure morals , and of all , probity . 
He had separated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes , and so that the women and girls might remain discreet . 
On this point he was inflexible . 
It was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant .
