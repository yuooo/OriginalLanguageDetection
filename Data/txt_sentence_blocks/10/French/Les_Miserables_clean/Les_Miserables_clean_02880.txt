Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors , oversight is supposed to continue , but it grows slack and reposes ; and the inspectors , moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside , no longer glanced into the garden , and had not seen the two delinquents . 
It had rained the night before , and even a little in the morning . 
But in June , showers do not count for much . 
An hour after a storm , it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept . 
The earth , in summer , is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child . 
At that period of the solstice , the light of full noonday is , so to speak , poignant . 
It takes everything . 
It applies itself to the earth , and superposes itself with a sort of suction . 
One would say that the sun was thirsty . 
A shower is but a glass of water ; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up .
