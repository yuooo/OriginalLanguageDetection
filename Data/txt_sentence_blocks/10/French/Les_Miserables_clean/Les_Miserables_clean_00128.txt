In our day , a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service , wears the livery of success , and performs the service of its antechamber . 
Succeed : theory . 
Prosperity argues capacity . 
Win in the lottery , and behold ! 
you are a clever man . 
He who triumphs is venerated . 
Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth ! 
everything lies in that . 
Be lucky , and you will have all the rest ; be happy , and people will think you great . 
Outside of five or six immense exceptions , which compose the splendor of a century , contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness .
