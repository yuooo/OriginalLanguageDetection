From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates . 
An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him , forgetfulness of self and pity for all . 
As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers , gives , and lavishes to souls which stand open , and refuses to souls that are closed , he comes to pity , he the millionnaire of the mind , the millionnaire of money . 
All hatred departs from his heart , in proportion as light penetrates his spirit . 
And is he unhappy ? 
No . 
The misery of a young man is never miserable . 
The first young lad who comes to hand , however poor he may be , with his strength , his health , his rapid walk , his brilliant eyes , his warmly circulating blood , his black hair , his red lips , his white teeth , his pure breath , will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor . 
And then , every morning , he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread ; and while his hands earn his bread , his dorsal column gains pride , his brain gathers ideas . 
His task finished , he returns to ineffable ecstasies , to contemplation , to joys ; he beholds his feet set in afflictions , in obstacles , on the pavement , in the nettles , sometimes in the mire ; his head in the light .
