Le dab est sinve , la dabuge est merloussiere , la fee est bative , the bourgeois is stupid , the bourgeoise is cunning , the daughter is pretty . 
Generally , to throw listeners off the track , slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction , an ignoble tail , a termination in aille , in orgue , in iergue , or in uche . 
Thus : Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche ? 
Do you think that leg of mutton good ? 
A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him . 
The termination in mar has been added recently . 
Slang , being the dialect of corruption , quickly becomes corrupted itself . 
Besides this , as it is always seeking concealment , as soon as it feels that it is understood , it changes its form . 
Contrary to what happens with every other vegetation , every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches . 
Thus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition ; an obscure and rapid work which never pauses .
