The Bishop looked at him , and said , -- `` You have suffered much ? '' 
`` Oh , the red coat , the ball on the ankle , a plank to sleep on , heat , cold , toil , the convicts , the thrashings , the double chain for nothing , the cell for one word ; even sick and in bed , still the chain ! 
Dogs , dogs are happier ! 
Nineteen years ! 
I am forty-six . 
Now there is the yellow passport . 
That is what it is like . '' 
`` Yes , '' resumed the Bishop , `` you have come from a very sad place . 
Listen . 
There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men .
