`` The hearing has just been begun again , '' replied the usher , `` but the door will not be opened again . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because the hall is full . '' 
`` What ! 
There is not room for one more ? '' 
`` Not another one . 
The door is closed . 
No one can enter now . '' 
The usher added after a pause : `` There are , to tell the truth , two or three extra places behind Monsieur le President , but Monsieur le President only admits public functionaries to them . '' 
So saying , the usher turned his back .
