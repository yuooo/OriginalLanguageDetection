He shut the door , leaned his back against it , and listened to Fantine 's despairing supplications . 
At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman , who would not rise , he emerged from the shadow , and said : -- `` One moment , if you please . '' 
Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine . 
He removed his hat , and , saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness : -- `` Excuse me , Mr. Mayor -- '' The words `` Mr. Mayor '' produced a curious effect upon Fantine . 
She rose to her feet with one bound , like a spectre springing from the earth , thrust aside the soldiers with both arms , walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one could prevent her , and gazing intently at him , with a bewildered air , she cried : -- `` Ah ! 
so it is you who are M. le Maire ! '' 
Then she burst into a laugh , and spit in his face . 
M. Madeleine wiped his face , and said : -- `` Inspector Javert , set this woman at liberty . '' 
Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad . 
He experienced at that moment , blow upon blow and almost simultaneously , the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life .
