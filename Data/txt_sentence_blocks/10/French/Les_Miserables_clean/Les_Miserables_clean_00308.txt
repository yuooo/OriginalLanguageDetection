It was a perfect delirium . 
From time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men . 
Matutinal intoxication of life ! 
adorable years ! 
the wings of the dragonfly quiver . 
Oh , whoever you may be , do you not remember ? 
Have you rambled through the brushwood , holding aside the branches , on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you ?

what a state they are in ! '' 
Let us say at once that that merry obstacle , a shower , was lacking in the case of this good-humored party , although Favourite had said as they set out , with a magisterial and maternal tone , `` The slugs are crawling in the paths , -- a sign of rain , children . ''
