`` Ah ! 
Do not say that even in jest ! 
If you were to cease to love me , I would spring after you , I would scratch you , I should rend you , I would throw you into the water , I would have you arrested . '' 
Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love . 
Favourite resumed : -- `` Yes , I would scream to the police ! 
Ah ! 
I should not restrain myself , not at all ! 
Rabble ! '' 
Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair , in an ecstasy , and closed both eyes proudly . 
Dahlia , as she ate , said in a low voice to Favourite , amid the uproar : -- `` So you really idolize him deeply , that Blachevelle of yours ? ''
