Fantine earned too little . 
Her debts had increased . 
The Thenardiers , who were not promptly paid , wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair , and whose carriage ruined her . 
One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather , that she needed a woollen skirt , and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this . 
She received the letter , and crushed it in her hands all day long . 
That evening she went into a barber 's shop at the corner of the street , and pulled out her comb . 
Her admirable golden hair fell to her knees . 
`` What splendid hair ! '' 
exclaimed the barber . 
`` How much will you give me for it ? ''
