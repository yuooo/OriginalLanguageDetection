At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois , and spurs the pedestrian . 
The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches . 
It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with the King of Spain , of Bolivar against Morillo . 
Narrow-brimmed hats were royalist , and were called morillos ; liberals wore hats with wide brims , which were called bolivars . 
Eight or ten months , then , after that which is related in the preceding pages , towards the first of January , 1823 , on a snowy evening , one of these dandies , one of these unemployed , a `` right thinker , '' for he wore a morillo , and was , moreover , warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather , was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress , with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair , in front of the officers ' cafe . 
This dandy was smoking , for he was decidedly fashionable . 
Each time that the woman passed in front of him , he bestowed on her , together with a puff from his cigar , some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful , such as , `` How ugly you are ! 
-- Will you get out of my sight ? 
-- You have no teeth ! '' 
etc. , etc. .
