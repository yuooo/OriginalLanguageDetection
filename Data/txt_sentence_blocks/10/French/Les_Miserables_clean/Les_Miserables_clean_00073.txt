he exclaimed . 
`` What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism ! 
Not every one who wants it can have it . 
Ah ! 
when one does have it , one is no longer a dupe , one does not stupidly allow one 's self to be exiled like Cato , nor stoned like Stephen , nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc . 
Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible , and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness , -- places , sinecures , dignities , power , whether well or ill acquired , lucrative recantations , useful treacheries , savory capitulations of conscience , -- and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished . 
How agreeable that is ! 
I do not say that with reference to you , senator . 
Nevertheless , it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you . 
You great lords have , so you say , a philosophy of your own , and for yourselves , which is exquisite , refined , accessible to the rich alone , good for all sauces , and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably .
