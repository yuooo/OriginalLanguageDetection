Follow a man who is following another man , indeed ! '' 
They retraced their steps . 
Marius had , in fact , seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard , and was spying on his proceedings . 
Jondrette walked straight ahead , without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance . 
He quitted the Rue Mouffetard , and Marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse ; he remained there about a quarter of an hour , then returned to the Rue Mouffetard . 
He halted at an ironmonger 's shop , which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard , and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop , holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle , which he concealed beneath his great-coat . 
At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
The day was declining ; the snow , which had ceased for a moment , had just begun again . 
Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier , which was deserted , as usual , and did not follow Jondrette into it . 
It was lucky that he did so , for , on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing , Jondrette turned round , made sure that no one was following him , did not see him , then sprang across the wall and disappeared .
