Terrible , toad-like tongue which goes and comes , leaps , crawls , slobbers , and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night , of hunger , of vice , of falsehood , of injustice , of nudity , of suffocation , and of winter , the high noonday of the miserable . 
Let us have compassion on the chastised . 
Alas ! 
Who are we ourselves ? 
Who am I who now address you ? 
Who are you who are listening to me ? 
And are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born ? 
The earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail . 
Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice ? 
Look closely at life .
