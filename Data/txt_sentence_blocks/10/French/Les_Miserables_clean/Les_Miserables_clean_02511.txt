This death was an affliction . 
Like everything that is bitter , affliction may turn to revolt . 
This is what took place . 
On the preceding evening , and on the morning of the 5th of June , the day appointed for Lamarque 's burial , the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , which the procession was to touch at , assumed a formidable aspect . 
This tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors . 
They armed themselves as best they might . 
Joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment `` to break down doors . '' 
One of them had made himself a dagger of a stocking-weaver 's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump . 
Another , who was in a fever `` to attack , '' slept wholly dressed for three days . 
A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade , who asked him : `` Whither are you going ? ''
