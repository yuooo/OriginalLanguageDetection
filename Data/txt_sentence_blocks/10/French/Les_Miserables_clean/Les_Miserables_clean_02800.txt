And those who have daughters ! 
what are you thinking of ? 
You get yourselves killed , you are dead , that is well . 
And tomorrow ? 
Young girls without bread -- that is a terrible thing . 
Man begs , woman sells . 
Ah ! 
those charming and gracious beings , so gracious and so sweet , who have bonnets of flowers , who fill the house with purity , who sing and prattle , who are like a living perfume , who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth , that Jeanne , that Lise , that Mimi , those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride , ah ! 
good God , they will suffer hunger ! 
What do you want me to say to you ?
