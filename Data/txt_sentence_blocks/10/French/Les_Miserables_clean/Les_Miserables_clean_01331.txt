Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless . 
Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh : -- `` He is dead ! '' 
And , drawing himself up , and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders , he cried : -- `` And this is the way I save his life ! '' 
Then the poor man fell to sobbing . 
He soliloquized the while , for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural . 
Powerful emotion often talks aloud . 
`` It is Father Mestienne 's fault . 
Why did that fool die ? 
What need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it ? 
It is he who has killed M. Madeleine .
