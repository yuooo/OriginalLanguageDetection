`` Of these men ? '' 
`` No more than yourself ! '' 
retorted Marius rudely , who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said `` monsieur '' to him . 
The inspector stared still more intently at Marius , and continued with sententious solemnity : -- `` There , you speak like a brave man , and like an honest man . 
Courage does not fear crime , and honesty does not fear authority . '' 
Marius interrupted him : -- `` That is well , but what do you intend to do ? '' 
The inspector contented himself with the remark : -- `` The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night . 
You must have one . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Marius .
