The handles are of silver at Bombarda 's and of bone at Edon 's .

`` Except for those who have a silver chin , '' observed Tholomyes . 
He was looking at the dome of the Invalides , which was visible from Bombarda 's windows .

`` Tholomyes , '' exclaimed Fameuil , `` Listolier and I were having a discussion just now . '' 
`` A discussion is a good thing , '' replied Tholomyes ; `` a quarrel is better . '' 
`` We were disputing about philosophy . '' 
`` Well ? ''
