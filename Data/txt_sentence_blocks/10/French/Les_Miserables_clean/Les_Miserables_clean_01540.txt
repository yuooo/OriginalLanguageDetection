Scepticism , that caries of the intelligence , had not left him a single whole idea . 
He lived with irony . 
This was his axiom : `` There is but one certainty , my full glass . '' 
He sneered at all devotion in all parties , the father as well as the brother , Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles . 
`` They are greatly in advance to be dead , '' he exclaimed . 
He said of the crucifix : `` There is a gibbet which has been a success . '' 
A rover , a gambler , a libertine , often drunk , he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly : `` J'aimons les filles , et j' aimons le bon vin . '' 
Air : Vive Henri IV . 
However , this sceptic had one fanaticism . 
This fanaticism was neither a dogma , nor an idea , nor an art , nor a science ; it was a man : Enjolras .
