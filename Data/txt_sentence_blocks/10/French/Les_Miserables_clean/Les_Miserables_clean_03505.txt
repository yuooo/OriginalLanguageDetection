Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange , Il vivait . 
Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange . 
La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva , Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s ` en va. -LSB- 70 -RSB- -LSB- 70 -RSB- He sleeps . 
Although his fate was very strange , he lived . 
He died when he had no longer his angel . 
The thing came to pass simply , of itself , as the night comes when day is gone . 
LETTER TO M. DAELLI Publisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in Milan . 
HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE , October 18 , 1862 . 
You are right , sir , when you tell me that Les Miserables is written for all nations . 
I do not know whether it will be read by all , but I wrote it for all .
