Madame de T. lived far from the Court ; `` a very mixed society , '' as she said , in a noble isolation , proud and poor . 
A few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth , and these constituted a purely Royalist salon . 
They sipped tea there , and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century , the charter , the Bonapartists , the prostitution of the blue ribbon , or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII. , according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs ; and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by Monsieur , afterwards Charles X . 
The songs of the fishwomen , in which Napoleon was called Nicolas , were received there with transports of joy . 
Duchesses , the most delicate and charming women in the world , went into ecstasies over couplets like the following , addressed to `` the federates '' : -- Refoncez dans vos culottes -LSB- 20 -RSB- Le bout d' chemis ' qui vous pend . 
Qu'on n ' dis ' pas qu ' les patriotes Ont arbore l' drapeau blanc ? 
-LSB- 20 -RSB- Tuck into your trousers the shirt-tail that is hanging out . 
Let it not be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag . 
There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible , with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous , with quatrains , with distiches even ; thus , upon the Dessolles ministry , a moderate cabinet , of which MM . 
Decazes and Deserre were members : -- Pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base , -LSB- 21 -RSB- Il faut changer de sol , et de serre et de case .
