He said , `` En be ! 
moussu , ses sage ? '' 
as in lower Languedoc ; `` Onte anaras passa ? '' 
as in the Basses-Alpes ; `` Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase , '' as in upper Dauphine . 
This pleased the people extremely , and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits . 
He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains . 
He understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms . 
As he spoke all tongues , he entered into all hearts . 
Moreover , he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes . 
He condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account .
