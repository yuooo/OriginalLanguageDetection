Napoleon was an artillery officer , and felt the effects of this . 
The foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who , in the report to the Directory on Aboukir , said : Such a one of our balls killed six men . 
All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles . 
The key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point . 
He treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel , and made a breach in it . 
He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot ; he joined and dissolved battles with cannon . 
There was something of the sharpshooter in his genius . 
To beat in squares , to pulverize regiments , to break lines , to crush and disperse masses , -- for him everything lay in this , to strike , strike , strike incessantly , -- and he intrusted this task to the cannon-ball . 
A redoubtable method , and one which , united with genius , rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years . 
On the 18th of June , 1815 , he relied all the more on his artillery , because he had numbers on his side .
