`` He is warning us , '' said Combeferre . 
A hasty rush troubled the deserted street ; they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus , and Gavroche bounded into the barricade , all breathless , saying : -- `` My gun ! 
Here they are ! '' 
An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade , and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible . 
`` Would you like my carbine ? '' 
said Enjolras to the lad . 
`` I want a big gun , '' replied Gavroche . 
And he seized Javert 's gun . 
Two sentinels had fallen back , and had come in almost at the same moment as Gavroche . 
They were the sentinels from the end of the street , and the vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie .
