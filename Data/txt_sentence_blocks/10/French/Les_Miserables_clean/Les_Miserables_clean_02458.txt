How much do you earn at your trade of lawyer ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' said Marius , with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce . 
`` Nothing ? 
Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that I allow you ? '' 
Marius did not reply . 
M. Gillenormand continued : -- `` Then I understand the girl is rich ? '' 
`` As rich as I am . '' 
`` What ! 
No dowry ? '' 
`` No . ''
