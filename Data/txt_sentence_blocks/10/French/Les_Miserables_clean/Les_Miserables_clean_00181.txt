I was liberated four days ago , and am on my way to Pontarlier , which is my destination . 
I have been walking for four days since I left Toulon . 
I have travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot . 
This evening , when I arrived in these parts , I went to an inn , and they turned me out , because of my yellow passport , which I had shown at the town-hall . 
I had to do it . 
I went to an inn . 
They said to me , ` Be off , ' at both places . 
No one would take me . 
I went to the prison ; the jailer would not admit me . 
I went into a dog 's kennel ; the dog bit me and chased me off , as though he had been a man .
