Down with the philosophers ! 
Wisdom consists in jubilation . 
Make merry , let us make merry . 
Are we happy because we are good , or are we good because we are happy ? 
Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy , or because it weighs six hundred carats ? 
I know nothing about it , life is full of such problems ; the important point is to possess the Sancy and happiness . 
Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking . 
Let us obey the sun blindly . 
What is the sun ? 
It is love .
