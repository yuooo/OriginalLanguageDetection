Light entered it on one side , and darkness on the other . 
Jean Valjean had not , as we have seen , an evil nature . 
He was still good when he arrived at the galleys . 
He there condemned society , and felt that he was becoming wicked ; he there condemned Providence , and was conscious that he was becoming impious . 
It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point . 
Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom ? 
Can the man created good by God be rendered wicked by man ? 
Can the soul be completely made over by fate , and become evil , fate being evil ? 
Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness , as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault ? 
Is there not in every human soul , was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular , a first spark , a divine element , incorruptible in this world , immortal in the other , which good can develop , fan , ignite , and make to glow with splendor , and which evil can never wholly extinguish ?
