One had chestnut hair ; the other , brown . 
Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises ; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them ; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood . 
Above and around these two delicate heads , all made of happiness and steeped in light , the gigantic fore-carriage , black with rust , almost terrible , all entangled in curves and wild angles , rose in a vault , like the entrance of a cavern . 
A few paces apart , crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry , the mother , not a very prepossessing woman , by the way , though touching at that moment , was swinging the two children by means of a long cord , watching them carefully , for fear of accidents , with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity . 
At every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound , which resembled a cry of rage ; the little girls were in ecstasies ; the setting sun mingled in this joy , and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim . 
As she rocked her little ones , the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated : -- `` It must be , said a warrior . '' 
Her song , and the contemplation of her daughters , prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street . 
In the meantime , some one had approached her , as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance , and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear : -- `` You have two beautiful children there , Madame . '' 
`` To the fair and tender Imogene -- '' replied the mother , continuing her romance ; then she turned her head . 
A woman stood before her , a few paces distant .
