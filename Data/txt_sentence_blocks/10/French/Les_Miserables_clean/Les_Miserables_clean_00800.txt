Ney had four horses killed under him . 
Half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau . 
This conflict lasted two hours . 
The English army was profoundly shaken . 
There is no doubt that , had they not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory . 
This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton , who had seen Talavera and Badajoz . 
Wellington , three-quarters vanquished , admired heroically . 
He said in an undertone , `` Sublime ! '' 
The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen , took or spiked sixty pieces of ordnance , and captured from the English regiments six flags , which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard bore to the Emperor , in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance . 
Wellington 's situation had grown worse .
