Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty . 
He had believed in a new life .

He had calculated that his earnings , during his sojourn in the galleys , ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs . 
It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years , which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs . 
At all events , his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous , which had been counted out to him on his departure . 
He had understood nothing of this , and had thought himself wronged .
