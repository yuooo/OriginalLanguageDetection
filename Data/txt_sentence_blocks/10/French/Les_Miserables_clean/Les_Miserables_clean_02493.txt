That which is grandest and that which is basest ; the beings who prowl outside of all bounds , awaiting an occasion , bohemians , vagrants , vagabonds of the cross-roads , those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven , those who , each day , demand their bread from chance and not from toil , the unknown of poverty and nothingness , the bare-armed , the bare-footed , belong to revolt . 
Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state , of life or of fate , is ripe for riot , and , as soon as it makes its appearance , he begins to quiver , and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind . 
Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature , and which , as it eddies about , mounts , descends , thunders , tears , razes , crushes , demolishes , uproots , bearing with it great natures and small , the strong man and the feeble mind , the tree trunk and the stalk of straw . 
Woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes ! 
It breaks the one against the other . 
It communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power . 
It fills the first-comer with the force of events ; it converts everything into projectiles . 
It makes a cannon-ball of a rough stone , and a general of a porter . 
If we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views , a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power . 
System : revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow .
