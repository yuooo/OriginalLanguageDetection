Fair days ! 
Manuel was proud and wise , Paris sat at sacred banquets , Foy launched thunderbolts , and your corsage had a pin on which I pricked myself . 
Everything gazed upon you . 
A briefless lawyer , when I took you to the Prado to dine , you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turn round , and I heard them say : Is she not beautiful ! 
How good she smells ! 
What billowing hair ! 
Beneath her mantle she hides a wing . 
Her charming bonnet is hardly unfolded . 
I wandered with thee , pressing thy supple arm . 
The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded , in our happy couple , the gentle month of April to the fair month of May .
