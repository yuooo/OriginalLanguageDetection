Being two divisions , there were two columns of them ; Wathier 's division held the right , Delort 's division was on the left . 
It seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the table-land . 
It traversed the battle like a prodigy . 
Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of the Muskowa by the heavy cavalry ; Murat was lacking here , but Ney was again present . 
It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul . 
Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp . 
They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there . 
A confusion of helmets , of cries , of sabres , a stormy heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of trumpets , a terrible and disciplined tumult ; over all , the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra . 
These narrations seemed to belong to another age . 
Something parallel to this vision appeared , no doubt , in the ancient Orphic epics , which told of the centaurs , the old hippanthropes , those Titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop , horrible , invulnerable , sublime -- gods and beasts .
