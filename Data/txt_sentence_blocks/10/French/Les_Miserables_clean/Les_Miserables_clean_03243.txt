Can there be too many perfumes , too many open rose-buds , too many nightingales singing , too many green leaves , too much aurora in life ? 
can people love each other too much ? 
can people please each other too much ? 
Take care , Estelle , thou art too pretty ! 
Have a care , Nemorin , thou art too handsome ! 
Fine stupidity , in sooth ! 
Can people enchant each other too much , cajole each other too much , charm each other too much ? 
Can one be too much alive , too happy ? 
Moderate your joys . 
Ah , indeed !
