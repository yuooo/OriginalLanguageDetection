Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine . 
A little of the Place de Greve is a good thing . 
What would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning ? 
Our laws are wisely provided , and thanks to them , this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday . 
TO SCOFF , TO REIGN There is no limit to Paris . 
No city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates . 
To please you , O Athenians ! 
exclaimed Alexander . 
Paris makes more than the law , it makes the fashion ; Paris sets more than the fashion , it sets the routine . 
Paris may be stupid , if it sees fit ; it sometimes allows itself this luxury ; then the universe is stupid in company with it ; then Paris awakes , rubs its eyes , says : `` How stupid I am ! ''
