`` Come in , '' said the Bishop . 
THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE . 
The door opened . 
It opened wide with a rapid movement , as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push . 
A man entered . 
We already know the man . 
It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter . 
He entered , advanced a step , and halted , leaving the door open behind him . 
He had his knapsack on his shoulders , his cudgel in his hand , a rough , audacious , weary , and violent expression in his eyes . 
The fire on the hearth lighted him up .
