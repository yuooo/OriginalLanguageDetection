Then he turned towards the bed , and , still seated , for he could not stand , he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects . 
These contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes . 
All at once he shivered , he felt that a child was taking possession of him ; he rested his elbows on the table , which was illuminated by the Bishop 's candles and took up the pen . 
His hand trembled . 
He wrote slowly the few following lines : `` Cosette , I bless thee . 
I am going to explain to thee . 
Thy husband was right in giving me to understand that I ought to go away ; but there is a little error in what he believed , though he was in the right . 
He is excellent . 
Love him well even after I am dead . 
Monsieur Pontmercy , love my darling child well .
