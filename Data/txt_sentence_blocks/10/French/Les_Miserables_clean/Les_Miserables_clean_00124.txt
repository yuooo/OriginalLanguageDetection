The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present . 
Every metropolis has its staff of officials . 
Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary , which goes the round , and maintains good order in the episcopal palace , and mounts guard over monseigneur 's smile . 
To please a bishop is equivalent to getting one 's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate . 
It is necessary to walk one 's path discreetly ; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship . 
Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere , there are big mitres in the Church . 
These are the bishops who stand well at Court , who are rich , well endowed , skilful , accepted by the world , who know how to pray , no doubt , but who know also how to beg , who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person , who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy , who are abbes rather than priests , prelates rather than bishops . 
Happy those who approach them ! 
Being persons of influence , they create a shower about them , upon the assiduous and the favored , and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing , of large parishes , prebends , archidiaconates , chaplaincies , and cathedral posts , while awaiting episcopal honors . 
As they advance themselves , they cause their satellites to progress also ; it is a whole solar system on the march .
