Vanity has a right and a wrong side ; the right side is stupid , it is the negro with his glass beads ; the wrong side is foolish , it is the philosopher with his rags . 
I weep over the one and I laugh over the other . 
What are called honors and dignities , and even dignity and honor , are generally of pinchbeck . 
Kings make playthings of human pride . 
Caligula made a horse a consul ; Charles II . 
made a knight of a sirloin . 
Wrap yourself up now , then , between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef . 
As for the intrinsic value of people , it is no longer respectable in the least . 
Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor . 
White on white is ferocious ; if the lily could speak , what a setting down it would give the dove !
