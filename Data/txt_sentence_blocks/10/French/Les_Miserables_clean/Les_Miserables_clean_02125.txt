Now she preferred the garden , and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence . 
Jean Valjean , who was shy , never set foot in the garden .

But what she had lost in ingenuous grace , she gained in pensive and serious charm . 
Her whole person , permeated with the joy of youth , of innocence , and of beauty , breathed forth a splendid melancholy .
