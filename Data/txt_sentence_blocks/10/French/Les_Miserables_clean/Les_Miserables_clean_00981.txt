He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace -- one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all , and which are so cold to look at . 
There was no fire in this one , there was not even ashes ; but there was something which attracted the stranger 's gaze , nevertheless . 
It was two tiny children 's shoes , coquettish in shape and unequal in size . 
The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve , there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy . 
Eponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this , and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth . 
The traveller bent over them . 
The fairy , that is to say , their mother , had already paid her visit , and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece . 
The man straightened himself up , and was on the point of withdrawing , when far in , in the darkest corner of the hearth , he caught sight of another object . 
He looked at it , and recognized a wooden shoe , a frightful shoe of the coarsest description , half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud . 
It was Cosette 's sabot .
