Close by a very young woman was nursing another child . 
The father was laughing , the child was laughing , the mother was smiling . 
The stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle . 
What was taking place within him ? 
He alone could have told . 
It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable , and that , in a place where he beheld so much happiness , he would find perhaps a little pity . 
He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock . 
They did not hear him . 
He tapped again . 
He heard the woman say , `` It seems to me , husband , that some one is knocking . ''
