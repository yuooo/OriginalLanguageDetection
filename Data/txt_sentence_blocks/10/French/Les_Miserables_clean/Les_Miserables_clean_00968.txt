What she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told , `` Little one , you are the Queen of France . '' 
It seemed to her that if she touched that doll , lightning would dart from it . 
This was true , up to a certain point , for she said to herself that the Thenardier would scold and beat her . 
Nevertheless , the attraction carried the day . 
She ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thenardier : -- `` May I , Madame ? '' 
No words can render that air , at once despairing , terrified , and ecstatic . 
`` Pardi ! '' 
cried the Thenardier , `` it is yours . 
The gentleman has given it to you . '' 
`` Truly , sir ? ''
