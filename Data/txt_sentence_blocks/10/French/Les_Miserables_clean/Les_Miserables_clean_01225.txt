At daybreak , Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes , after having done an enormous deal of thinking , and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss of straw , and watching Cosette 's slumbers . 
Fauchelevent sat up and said : -- `` Now that you are here , how are you going to contrive to enter ? '' 
This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his revery . 
The two men took counsel together . 
`` In the first place , '' ' said Fauchelevent , `` you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber , either you or the child . 
One step in the garden and we are done for . '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` Monsieur Madeleine , '' resumed Fauchelevent , `` you have arrived at a very auspicious moment , I mean to say a very inauspicious moment ; one of the ladies is very ill . 
This will prevent them from looking much in our direction . 
It seems that she is dying .
