Why had this agent preserved silence ? 
Had the man succeeded in making his escape ? 
Had he bribed the agent ? 
Why did this man give no sign of life to Marius , who owed everything to him ? 
His disinterestedness was no less tremendous than his devotion . 
Why had not that man appeared again ? 
Perhaps he was above compensation , but no one is above gratitude . 
Was he dead ? 
Who was the man ? 
What sort of a face had he ?
