`` What is your name ? '' 
inquired Laigle . 
`` Navet , Gavroche 's friend . '' 
`` Stay with us , '' said Laigle . 
`` Breakfast with us , '' said Grantaire , The child replied : -- `` I ca n't , I belong in the procession , I 'm the one to shout ` Down with Polignac ! ' '' 
And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him , which is the most respectful of all possible salutes , he took his departure . 
The child gone , Grantaire took the word : -- `` That is the pure-bred gamin . 
There are a great many varieties of the gamin species . 
The notary 's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter , the cook 's gamin is called a scullion , the baker 's gamin is called a mitron , the lackey 's gamin is called a groom , the marine gamin is called the cabin-boy , the soldier 's gamin is called the drummer-boy , the painter 's gamin is called paint-grinder , the tradesman 's gamin is called an errand-boy , the courtesan gamin is called the minion , the kingly gamin is called the dauphin , the god gamin is called the bambino . '' 
In the meantime , Laigle was engaged in reflection ; he said half aloud : -- `` A B C , that is to say : the burial of Lamarque . ''
