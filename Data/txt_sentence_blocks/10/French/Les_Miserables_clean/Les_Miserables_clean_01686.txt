The porter raised his head and said : -- `` Are you a police spy , sir ? '' 
Marius went off quite abashed , but delighted . 
He was getting on . 
`` Good , '' thought he , `` I know that her name is Ursule , that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income , and that she lives there , on the third floor , in the Rue de l'Ouest . '' 
On the following day , M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the Luxembourg ; they went away while it was still broad daylight . 
Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest , as he had taken up the habit of doing . 
On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter pass in first , then paused , before crossing the threshold , and stared intently at Marius . 
On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg . 
Marius waited for them all day in vain . 
At nightfall , he went to the Rue de l'Ouest , and saw a light in the windows of the third story .
