Marius , lowering his eyelids , in order to keep his tears from flowing , took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs : `` My father ! '' 
`` And you also , you pardon me ! '' 
Jean Valjean said to him . 
Marius could find no words , and Jean Valjean added : `` Thanks . '' 
Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed . 
`` It embarrasses me , '' said she . 
And , seating herself on the old man 's knees , she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement , and kissed his brow . 
Jean Valjean , bewildered , let her have her own way . 
Cosette , who only understood in a very confused manner , redoubled her caresses , as though she desired to pay Marius ' debt .
