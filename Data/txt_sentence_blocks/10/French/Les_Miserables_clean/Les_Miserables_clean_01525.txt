And in fact , if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view , and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings , with fire and blood in its talons , the beauty of progress lies in being spotless ; and there exists between Washington , who represents the one , and Danton , who incarnates the other , that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle . 
Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre . 
His name was Jehan , owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the Middle Ages . 
Jean Prouvaire was in love ; he cultivated a pot of flowers , played on the flute , made verses , loved the people , pitied woman , wept over the child , confounded God and the future in the same confidence , and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head , that of Andre Chenier . 
His voice was ordinarily delicate , but suddenly grew manly . 
He was learned even to erudition , and almost an Orientalist . 
Above all , he was good ; and , a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur , in the matter of poetry , he preferred the immense . 
He knew Italian , Latin , Greek , and Hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : Dante , Juvenal , AEschylus , and Isaiah . 
In French , he preferred Corneille to Racine , and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille . 
He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers , and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events .
