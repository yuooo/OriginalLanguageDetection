The Royalists of to-day are demagogues , let us record it to their credit . 
At Madame de T. 's the society was superior , taste was exquisite and haughty , under the cover of a great show of politeness . 
Manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself , buried but still alive . 
Some of these habits , especially in the matter of language , seem eccentric . 
Persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique . 
A woman was called Madame la Generale . 
Madame la Colonelle was not entirely disused . 
The charming Madame de Leon , in memory , no doubt , of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse , preferred this appellation to her title of Princesse . 
The Marquise de Crequy was also called Madame la Colonelle . 
It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the refinement of speaking to the King in private as the King , in the third person , and never as Your Majesty , the designation of Your Majesty having been `` soiled by the usurper . ''
