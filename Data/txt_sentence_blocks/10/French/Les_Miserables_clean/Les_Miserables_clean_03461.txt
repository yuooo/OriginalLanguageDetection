An unheard-of virtue , supreme and sweet , humble in its immensity , appeared to him . 
The convict was transfigured into Christ . 
Marius was dazzled by this prodigy . 
He did not know precisely what he beheld , but it was grand . 
In an instant , a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door . 
Marius helped Cosette in and darted in himself . 
`` Driver , '' said he , `` Rue de l'Homme Arme , Number 7 . '' 
The carriage drove off . 
`` Ah ! 
what happiness ! ''
