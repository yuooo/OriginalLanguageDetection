`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold ? '' 
`` Monseigneur 's dining-room ? '' 
exclaimed the stupefied director . 
The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment , and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes . 
`` It would hold full twenty beds , '' said he , as though speaking to himself . 
Then , raising his voice : -- `` Hold , Monsieur the director of the hospital , I will tell you something . 
There is evidently a mistake here . 
There are thirty-six of you , in five or six small rooms . 
There are three of us here , and we have room for sixty . 
There is some mistake , I tell you ; you have my house , and I have yours .
