Besides this , they were on the throne . 
In their toilettes , in their gayety , in the noise which they made , there was sovereignty . 
When they entered , the Thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration , `` Ah ! 
there you are , you children ! '' 
Then drawing them , one after the other to her knees , smoothing their hair , tying their ribbons afresh , and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers , she exclaimed , `` What frights they are ! '' 
They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner . 
They had a doll , which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter . 
From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting , and watched their play with a melancholy air . 
Eponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette . 
She was the same as a dog to them .
