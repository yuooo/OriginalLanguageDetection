He remained in thought for a moment , mechanically passing the tip of his fore-finger across his thumb-nail , then he lifted up his voice : `` All is nearly over . 
But one last thing remains for me ... '' `` What is it ? '' 
Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation , and , without voice , without breath , he stammered rather than said : `` Now that you know , do you think , sir , you , who are the master , that I ought not to see Cosette any more ? '' 
`` I think that would be better , '' replied Marius coldly . 
`` I shall never see her more , '' murmured Jean Valjean . 
And he directed his steps towards the door . 
He laid his hand on the knob , the latch yielded , the door opened . 
Jean Valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through , stood motionless for a second , then closed the door again and turned to Marius . 
He was no longer pale , he was livid . 
There were no longer any tears in his eyes , but only a sort of tragic flame .
