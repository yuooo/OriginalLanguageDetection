This time , it was decisive . 
The group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated in confusion . 
Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them . 
Many , finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns , did not wish to die . 
This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservation emits howls , when the beast re-appears in men . 
They were hemmed in by the lofty , six-story house which formed the background of their redoubt . 
This house might prove their salvation . 
The building was barricaded , and walled , as it were , from top to bottom . 
Before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt , there was time for a door to open and shut , the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that , and the door of that house , suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly , was life for these despairing men . 
Behind this house , there were streets , possible flight , space .
