He took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks . 
Then , although it was still broad daylight , -- it was summer , -- he lighted them . 
In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse . 
Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him , and he was obliged to sit down . 
It was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it ; it was the remnant of all movement possible to him , it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed . 
The chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirror , so fatal for him , so providential for Marius , in which he had read Cosette 's reversed writing on the blotting book . 
He caught sight of himself in this mirror , and did not recognize himself . 
He was eighty years old ; before Marius ' marriage , he would have hardly been taken for fifty ; that year had counted for thirty . 
What he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age , it was the mysterious mark of death . 
The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there .
