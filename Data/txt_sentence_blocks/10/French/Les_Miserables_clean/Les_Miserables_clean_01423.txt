Mademoiselle Vaubois , perfect in her style , was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence . 
Let us say it plainly , Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older . 
This is the case with passive natures . 
She had never been malicious , which is relative kindness ; and then , years wear away the angles , and the softening which comes with time had come to her . 
She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret . 
There breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished , and which had never had a beginning . 
She kept house for her father . 
M. Gillenormand had his daughter near him , as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him . 
These households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare , and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support . 
There was also in this house , between this elderly spinster and this old man , a child , a little boy , who was always trembling and mute in the presence of M. Gillenormand .
