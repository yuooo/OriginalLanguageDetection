He did what the wolf does : he shook himself . 
Audacity had succeeded with him once . 
`` Monsieur-I-don ` t-know-your-name , '' he said resolutely , and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony , `` I shall take back Cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns . '' 
The stranger said tranquilly : -- `` Come , Cosette . '' 
He took Cosette by his left hand , and with his right he picked up his cudgel , which was lying on the ground . 
Thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot . 
The man plunged into the forest with the child , leaving the inn-keeper motionless and speechless . 
While they were walking away , Thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders , which were a little rounded , and his great fists . 
Then , bringing his eyes back to his own person , they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands . 
`` I really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun , '' he said to himself , `` since I was going hunting ! ''
