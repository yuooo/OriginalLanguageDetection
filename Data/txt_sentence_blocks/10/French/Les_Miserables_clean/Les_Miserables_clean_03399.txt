Marius had taken Cosette to his father 's grave .

Moreover that which is called , far too harshly in certain cases , the ingratitude of children , is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed . 
It is the ingratitude of nature .

Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing . 
Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows , those who are arriving towards the light . 
Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old , and involuntary on the part of the young . 
This breach , at first insensible , increases slowly , like all separations of branches .
