Favourite exclaimed : -- `` What a row ! 
One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away . '' 
It chanced that one of these vehicles , which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms , halted for a moment , then set out again at a gallop .

`` That 's odd ! '' 
said she . 
`` I thought the diligence never stopped . '' 
Favourite shrugged her shoulders . 
`` This Fantine is surprising . 
I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity .
