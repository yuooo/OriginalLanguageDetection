He had given to Cosette a robe of Binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother . 
`` These fashions come up again , '' said he , `` ancient things are the rage , and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood . '' 
He rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer , with swelling fronts , which had not been opened for years . 
-- `` Let us hear the confession of these dowagers , '' he said , `` let us see what they have in their paunches . '' 
He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all his wives , of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers . 
Pekins , damasks , lampas , painted moires , robes of shot gros de Tours , India kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed , dauphines without a right or wrong side , in the piece , Genoa and Alencon point lace , parures in antique goldsmith 's work , ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented with microscopic battles , gewgaws and ribbons -- he lavished everything on Cosette . 
Cosette , amazed , desperately in love with Marius , and wild with gratitude towards M. Gillenormand , dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet . 
Her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim . 
Her soul flew out into the azure depths , with wings of Mechlin lace . 
The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled , as we have already said , by the ecstasy of the grandfather .
