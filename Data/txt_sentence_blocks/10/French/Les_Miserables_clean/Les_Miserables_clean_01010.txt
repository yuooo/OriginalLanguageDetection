Cosette shuddered , and pressed close to the old man . 
He replied , gazing to the very bottom of Thenardier 's eyes the while , and enunciating every syllable distinctly : -- `` You are go-ing to take back Co-sette ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , I am . 
I will tell you ; I have considered the matter .

I am an honest man , you see ; this child does not belong to me ; she belongs to her mother .
