These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth : `` It is nothing to die ; it is dreadful not to live . '' 
All at once he rose to his feet . 
These accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony . 
He walked with a firm step to the wall , thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him , detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there , and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health , and said in a loud voice , as he laid the crucifix on the table : `` Behold the great martyr . '' 
Then his chest sank in , his head wavered , as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him . 
His hands , which rested on his knees , began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers . 
Cosette supported his shoulders , and sobbed , and tried to speak to him , but could not . 
Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears , they distinguished words like the following : `` Father , do not leave us . 
Is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again ? '' 
It might be said that agony writhes .
