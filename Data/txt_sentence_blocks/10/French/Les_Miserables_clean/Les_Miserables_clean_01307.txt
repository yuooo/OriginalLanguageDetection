The hearse had set out again , and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery . 
Fauchelevent had slackened his pace . 
He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity . 
The grave-digger walked on in front of him . 
Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review . 
He was one of those men who , though very young , have the air of age , and who , though slender , are extremely strong . 
`` Comrade ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
The man turned round . 
`` I am the convent grave-digger . ''
