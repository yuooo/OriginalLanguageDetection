But without proofs , in a fit of rage , with the object of wreaking my vengeance , I have denounced you as a convict , you , a respectable man , a mayor , a magistrate ! 
That is serious , very serious . 
I have insulted authority in your person , I , an agent of the authorities ! 
If one of my subordinates had done what I have done , I should have declared him unworthy of the service , and have expelled him . 
Well ? 
Stop , Mr. Mayor ; one word more . 
I have often been severe in the course of my life towards others . 
That is just . 
I have done well . 
Now , if I were not severe towards myself , all the justice that I have done would become injustice .
