Hence the name of Corinthe . 
Nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses . 
The ellipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase . 
Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses . 
The last proprietor of the dynasty , Father Hucheloup , no longer acquainted even with the tradition , had the post painted blue . 
A room on the ground floor , where the bar was situated , one on the first floor containing a billiard-table , a wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling , wine on the tables , smoke on the walls , candles in broad daylight , -- this was the style of this cabaret . 
A staircase with a trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar . 
On the second floor were the lodgings of the Hucheloup family . 
They were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase , and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor . 
Under the roof , in two mansard attics , were the nests for the servants .
