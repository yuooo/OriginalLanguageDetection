Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been , if the stories anent his youth , and even in regard to his manhood , were to be believed , a passionate , and , possibly , a violent man . 
His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life , and had trickled there slowly , thought by thought ; for , in a character , as in a rock , there may exist apertures made by drops of water . 
These hollows are uneffaceable ; these formations are indestructible . 
In 1815 , as we think we have already said , he reached his seventy-fifth birthday , but he did not appear to be more than sixty . 
He was not tall ; he was rather plump ; and , in order to combat this tendency , he was fond of taking long strolls on foot ; his step was firm , and his form was but slightly bent , a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion . 
Gregory XVI. , at the age of eighty , held himself erect and smiling , which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop . 
Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a `` fine head , '' but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine . 
When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms , and of which we have already spoken , people felt at their ease with him , and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person . 
His fresh and ruddy complexion , his very white teeth , all of which he had preserved , and which were displayed by his smile , gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man , `` He 's a good fellow '' ; and of an old man , `` He is a fine man . '' 
That , it will be recalled , was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon .
