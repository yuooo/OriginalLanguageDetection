`` Oh , yes , sir ! '' 
said she , `` the horse has had a drink ; he drank out of a bucket , a whole bucketful , and it was I who took the water to him , and I spoke to him . '' 
It was not true ; Cosette lied . 
`` There 's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house , '' exclaimed the pedler . 
`` I tell you that he has not been watered , you little jade ! 
He has a way of blowing when he has had no water , which I know well . '' 
Cosette persisted , and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish , and which was hardly audible : -- `` And he drank heartily . '' 
`` Come , '' said the pedler , in a rage , `` this wo n't do at all , let my horse be watered , and let that be the end of it ! '' 
Cosette crept under the table again . 
`` In truth , that is fair ! ''
