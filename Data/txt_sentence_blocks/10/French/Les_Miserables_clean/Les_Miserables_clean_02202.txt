We might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf ! 
And Monsieur does not sleep in the house , to boot . 
But fear nothing , Miss , I fasten the shutters up like prisons . 
Lone women ! 
That is enough to make one shudder , I believe you ! 
Just imagine , what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say : ` Hold your tongue ! ' 
and begin to cut your throat . 
It 's not the dying so much ; you die , for one must die , and that 's all right ; it 's the abomination of feeling those people touch you . 
And then , their knives ; they ca n't be able to cut well with them ! 
Ah , good gracious ! ''
