Grantaire rose to his feet with a start , stretched out his arms , rubbed his eyes , stared , yawned , and understood . 
A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away . 
One beholds , at a single glance and as a whole , all that it has concealed . 
All suddenly presents itself to the memory ; and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last twenty-four hours , has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed . 
Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity ; the obliteration of intoxication , a sort of steam which has obscured the brain , is dissipated , and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities . 
Relegated , as he was , to one corner , and sheltered behind the billiard-table , the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras , had not even noticed Grantaire , and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order : `` Take aim ! '' 
when all at once , they heard a strong voice shout beside them : `` Long live the Republic ! 
I 'm one of them . '' 
Grantaire had risen . 
The immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed , and in which he had had no part , appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man .
