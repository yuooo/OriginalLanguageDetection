`` Ah ! 
bah ! 
But I am dying of hunger . 
I have been walking since sunrise . 
I have travelled twelve leagues . 
I pay . 
I wish to eat . '' 
`` I have nothing , '' said the landlord . 
The man burst out laughing , and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves : `` Nothing ! 
and all that ? ''
