Below ran this inscription : AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO -LRB- Au Sargent de Waterloo -RRB- . 
Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry . 
Nevertheless , the vehicle , or , to speak more accurately , the fragment of a vehicle , which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the Sergeant of Waterloo , one evening in the spring of 1818 , would certainly have attracted , by its mass , the attention of any painter who had passed that way . 
It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country , and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees . 
This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot , into which was fitted a heavy shaft , and which was supported by two huge wheels . 
The whole thing was compact , overwhelming , and misshapen . 
It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon . 
The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels , the fellies , the hub , the axle , and the shaft , a layer of mud , a hideous yellowish daubing hue , tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals . 
The wood was disappearing under mud , and the iron beneath rust . 
Under the axle-tree hung , like drapery , a huge chain , worthy of some Goliath of a convict .
