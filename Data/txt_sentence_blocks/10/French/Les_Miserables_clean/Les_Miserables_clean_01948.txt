Javert put on his hat again , and advanced a couple of paces into the room , with arms folded , his cane under one arm , his sword in its sheath . 
`` Halt there , '' said he . 
`` You shall not go out by the window , you shall go through the door . 
It 's less unhealthy . 
There are seven of you , there are fifteen of us . 
Do n't let 's fall to collaring each other like men of Auvergne . '' 
Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse , and put it in Thenardier 's hand , whispering in the latter 's ear : -- `` It 's Javert . 
I do n't dare fire at that man . 
Do you dare ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! ''
