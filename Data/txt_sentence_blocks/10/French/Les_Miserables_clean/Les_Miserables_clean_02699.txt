THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE A peculiarity of this species of war is , that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front , and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position , either because they fear ambushes , or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets . 
The insurgents ' whole attention had been directed , therefore , to the grand barricade , which was , evidently , the spot always menaced , and there the struggle would infallibly recommence . 
But Marius thought of the little barricade , and went thither . 
It was deserted and guarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones . 
Moreover , the Mondetour alley , and the branches of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm . 
As Marius was withdrawing , after concluding his inspection , he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness . 
`` Monsieur Marius ! '' 
He started , for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet . 
Only , the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath .
