Oh , implacable march of human societies ! 
Oh , losses of men and of souls on the way ! 
Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip ! 
Disastrous absence of help ! 
Oh , moral death ! 
The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned . 
The sea is the immensity of wretchedness . 
The soul , going down stream in this gulf , may become a corpse . 
Who shall resuscitate it ? 
NEW TROUBLES When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys , when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words , Thou art free !
