In spite of diminishing the length of her stops , and of walking as long as possible between them , she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in this manner , and that the Thenardier would beat her . 
This anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night ; she was worn out with fatigue , and had not yet emerged from the forest . 
On arriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted , made a last halt , longer than the rest , in order that she might get well rested ; then she summoned up all her strength , picked up her bucket again , and courageously resumed her march , but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from crying , `` O my God ! 
my God ! '' 
At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything at all : a hand , which seemed to her enormous , had just seized the handle , and lifted it vigorously . 
She raised her head . 
A large black form , straight and erect , was walking beside her through the darkness ; it was a man who had come up behind her , and whose approach she had not heard . 
This man , without uttering a word , had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying . 
There are instincts for all the encounters of life . 
The child was not afraid .
