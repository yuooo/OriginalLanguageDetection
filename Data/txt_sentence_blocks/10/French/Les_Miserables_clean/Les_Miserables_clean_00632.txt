The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun 's ear , `` Say that he is busy with the city council . '' 
Sister Simplice blushed faintly , for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her . 
On the other hand , it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would , without doubt , deal her a terrible blow , and that this was a serious matter in Fantine 's present state . 
Her flush did not last long ; the sister raised her calm , sad eyes to Fantine , and said , `` Monsieur le Maire has gone away . '' 
Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed : her eyes sparkled ; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face . 
`` Gone ! '' 
she cried ; `` he has gone to get Cosette . '' 
Then she raised her arms to heaven , and her white face became ineffable ; her lips moved ; she was praying in a low voice . 
When her prayer was finished , `` Sister , '' she said , `` I am willing to lie down again ; I will do anything you wish ; I was naughty just now ; I beg your pardon for having spoken so loud ; it is very wrong to talk loudly ; I know that well , my good sister , but , you see , I am very happy : the good God is good ; M. Madeleine is good ; just think ! 
he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little Cosette . ''
