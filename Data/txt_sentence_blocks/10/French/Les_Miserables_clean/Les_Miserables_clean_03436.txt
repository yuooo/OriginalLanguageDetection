Thenardier , for it was really he , was strangely surprised ; he would have been troubled , had he been capable of such a thing . 
He had come to bring astonishment , and it was he who had received it . 
This humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him , and , taking it all in all , he accepted it ; but he was none the less bewildered . 
He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time , and , in spite of his disguise , this Baron Pontmercy recognized him , and recognized him thoroughly . 
And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to Thenardier , but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean . 
Who was this almost beardless young man , who was so glacial and so generous , who knew people 's names , who knew all their names , and who opened his purse to them , who bullied rascals like a judge , and who paid them like a dupe ? 
Thenardier , the reader will remember , although he had been Marius ' neighbor , had never seen him , which is not unusual in Paris ; he had formerly , in a vague way , heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named Marius who lived in the house . 
He had written to him , without knowing him , the letter with which the reader is acquainted . 
No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possible in his mind . 
As for the name Pontmercy , it will be recalled that , on the battlefield of Waterloo , he had only heard the last two syllables , for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks .
