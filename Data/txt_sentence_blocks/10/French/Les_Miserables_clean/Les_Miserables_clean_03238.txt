In the antechamber , three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by Haydn . 
Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room , behind the door , the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him . 
A few moments before they sat down to table , Cosette came , as though inspired by a sudden whim , and made him a deep courtesy , spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands , and with a tenderly roguish glance , she asked him : `` Father , are you satisfied ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I am content ! '' 
`` Well , then , laugh . '' 
Jean Valjean began to laugh . 
A few moments later , Basque announced that dinner was served . 
The guests , preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm , entered the dining-room , and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table . 
Two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride , the first for M. Gillenormand , the other for Jean Valjean . 
M. Gillenormand took his seat .
