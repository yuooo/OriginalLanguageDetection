Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness . 
The long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension . 
It was the same enchantment in two souls , tinged with voluptuousness in Marius , and with modesty in Cosette . 
They said to each other in low tones : `` We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue Plumet . '' 
The folds of Cosette 's gown lay across Marius . 
Such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality . 
One possesses and one supposes . 
One still has time before one to divine . 
The emotion on that day , of being at mid-day and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable . 
The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd , and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness .
