Nevertheless , it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them . 
When the nettle is young , the leaf makes an excellent vegetable ; when it is older , it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax . 
Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth . 
Chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; pounded , they are good for horned cattle . 
The seed of the nettle , mixed with fodder , gives gloss to the hair of animals ; the root , mixed with salt , produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter . 
Moreover , it is an excellent hay , which can be cut twice . 
And what is required for the nettle ? 
A little soil , no care , no culture . 
Only the seed falls as it is ripe , and it is difficult to collect it . 
That is all .
