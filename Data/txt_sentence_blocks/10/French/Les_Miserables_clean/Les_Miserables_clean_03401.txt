On the day after that , he did not leave his bed . 
His portress , who prepared his scanty repasts , a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon , glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed : `` But you ate nothing yesterday , poor , dear man ! '' 
`` Certainly I did , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` The plate is quite full . '' 
`` Look at the water jug . 
It is empty . '' 
`` That proves that you have drunk ; it does not prove that you have eaten . '' 
`` Well , '' said Jean Valjean , `` what if I felt hungry only for water ? '' 
`` That is called thirst , and , when one does not eat at the same time , it is called fever . '' 
`` I will eat to-morrow . ''
