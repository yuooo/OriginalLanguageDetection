He added with a strange expression , and as though he were exerting an effort in speaking in this manner : `` I will wait for you here . '' 
Jean Valjean looked at Javert . 
This mode of procedure was but little in accord with Javert 's habits . 
However , he could not be greatly surprised that Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him , the confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of its claws , seeing that Jean Valjean had made up his mind to surrender himself and to make an end of it . 
He pushed open the door , entered the house , called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord from his couch : `` It is I ! '' 
and ascended the stairs . 
On arriving at the first floor , he paused .

The window on the landing-place , which was a sash-window , was open .
