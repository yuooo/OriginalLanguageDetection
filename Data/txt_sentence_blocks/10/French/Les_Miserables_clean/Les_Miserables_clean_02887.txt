The statues under the trees , white and nude , had robes of shadow pierced with light ; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight ; rays hung from them on all sides . 
Around the great fountain , the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt . 
There was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there . 
A few yellow leaves , left over from the autumn , chased each other merrily , and seemed to be playing tricks on each other . 
This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it . 
Life , sap , heat , odors overflowed ; one was conscious , beneath creation , of the enormous size of the source ; in all these breaths permeated with love , in this interchange of reverberations and reflections , in this marvellous expenditure of rays , in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold , one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible ; and , behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame , one caught a glimpse of God , that millionaire of stars . 
Thanks to the sand , there was not a speck of mud ; thanks to the rain , there was not a grain of ashes . 
The clumps of blossoms had just been bathed ; every sort of velvet , satin , gold and varnish , which springs from the earth in the form of flowers , was irreproachable . 
This magnificence was cleanly . 
The grand silence of happy nature filled the garden .
