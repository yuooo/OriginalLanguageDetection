Mademoiselle Gillenormand , who did not like books , demanded in a low tone of Nicolette . 
`` Well , '' retorted M. Gillenormand , who had overheard her , in the same tone , `` he 's a learned man . 
What then ? 
Is that his fault ? 
Monsieur Boulard , one of my acquaintances , never walked out without a book under his arm either , and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that . '' 
And , with a bow , he said aloud : `` Monsieur Tranchelevent ... '' Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally , but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his . 
`` Monsieur Tranchelevent , I have the honor of asking you , on behalf of my grandson , Baron Marius Pontmercy , for the hand of Mademoiselle . '' 
Monsieur Tranchelevent bowed . 
`` That 's settled , '' said the grandfather . 
And , turning to Marius and Cosette , with both arms extended in blessing , he cried : `` Permission to adore each other ! ''
