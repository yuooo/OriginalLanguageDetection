There was but one thing to be done , to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre . 
That was sure , efficacious , and free from danger . 
Marius made the driver a sign to halt , and called to him : -- `` By the hour ? '' 
Marius wore no cravat , he had on his working-coat , which was destitute of buttons , his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom . 
The driver halted , winked , and held out his left hand to Marius , rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` Pay in advance , '' said the coachman . 
Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him . 
`` How much ? ''
