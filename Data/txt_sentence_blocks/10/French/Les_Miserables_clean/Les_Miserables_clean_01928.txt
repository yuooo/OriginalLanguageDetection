The enigma was more impenetrable than ever . 
Who was this `` little one '' whom Thenardier had called the Lark ? 
Was she his `` Ursule '' ? 
The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word , `` the Lark , '' and had replied in the most natural manner in the world : `` I do not know what you mean . '' 
On the other hand , the two letters U. F. were explained ; they meant Urbain Fabre ; and Ursule was no longer named Ursule . 
This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all . 
A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post , from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene . 
There he stood , almost incapable of movement or reflection , as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters . 
He waited , in the hope of some incident , no matter of what nature , since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide . 
`` In any case , '' he said , `` if she is the Lark , I shall see her , for the Thenardier woman is to bring her hither .
