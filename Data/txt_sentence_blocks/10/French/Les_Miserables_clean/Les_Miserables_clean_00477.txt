It is not possible that any one could have said that . 
I did not hear aright . 
It can not have been that monster of a mayor ! 
Was it you , my good Monsieur Javert , who said that I was to be set free ? 
Oh , see here ! 
I will tell you about it , and you will let me go . 
That monster of a mayor , that old blackguard of a mayor , is the cause of all . 
Just imagine , Monsieur Javert , he turned me out ! 
all because of a pack of rascally women , who gossip in the workroom . 
If that is not a horror , what is ?
