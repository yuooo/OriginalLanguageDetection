The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner . 
A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast . 
There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Greve . 
Samson and the Abbe Montes are the truly popular names . 
They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him . 
They sometimes admire him . 
Lacenaire , when a gamin , on seeing the hideous Dautin die bravely , uttered these words which contain a future : `` I was jealous of him . '' 
In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known , but Papavoine is . 
`` Politicians '' are confused with assassins in the same legend . 
They have a tradition as to everybody 's last garment .
