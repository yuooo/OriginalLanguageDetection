Go down as quick as you can . '' 
She hastily obeyed , and Jondrette was left alone . 
He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table , turned the chisel in the brazier , set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish , then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope , and bent down as though to examine something . 
Marius then recognized the fact , that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder , with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it . 
This ladder , and some large tools , veritable masses of iron , which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door , had not been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning , and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon , during Marius ' absence . 
`` Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker , '' thought Marius . 
Had Marius been a little more learned in this line , he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker , certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock , and others which will cut or slice , the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants . 
The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius . 
The brazier being concealed , the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle ; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow . 
There was something indescribably calm , threatening , and hideous about this chamber .
