`` With whom ? '' 
he demanded . 
`` With that poor Marius . '' 
He raised his aged head , laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table , and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone : -- `` Poor Marius , do you say ! 
That gentleman is a knave , a wretched scoundrel , a vain little ingrate , a heartless , soulless , haughty , and wicked man ! '' 
And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye . 
Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours , to say to his daughter point-blank : -- `` I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him to me . '' 
Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort , and pronounced this acute diagnosis : `` My father never cared very much for my sister after her folly . 
It is clear that he detests Marius . '' 
`` After her folly '' meant : `` after she had married the colonel . ''
