Thus it was said in the town , when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure , he indulges in the cheer of a trappist . 
After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire ; then he retired to his own room and set to writing , sometimes on loose sheets , and again on the margin of some folio . 
He was a man of letters and rather learned . 
He left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts ; among others , a dissertation on this verse in Genesis , In the beginning , the spirit of God floated upon the waters . 
With this verse he compares three texts : the Arabic verse which says , The winds of God blew ; Flavius Josephus who says , A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth ; and finally , the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos , which renders it , A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters . 
In another dissertation , he examines the theological works of Hugo , Bishop of Ptolemais , great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book , and establishes the fact , that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century , under the pseudonym of Barleycourt . 
Sometimes , in the midst of his reading , no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand , he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation , whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself . 
These lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them . 
We now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton , Cornwallis , and the Admirals on the American station . 
Versailles , Poincot , book-seller ; and Paris , Pissot , bookseller , Quai des Augustins .
