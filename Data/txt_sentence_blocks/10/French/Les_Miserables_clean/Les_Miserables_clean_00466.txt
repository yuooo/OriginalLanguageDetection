On entering , Fantine fell down in a corner , motionless and mute , crouching down like a terrified dog . 
The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table . 
Javert seated himself , drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket , and began to write . 
This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police . 
The latter do what they please , punish them , as seems good to them , and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty . 
Javert was impassive ; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever . 
Nevertheless , he was seriously and deeply preoccupied . 
It was one of those moments when he was exercising without control , but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience , his redoubtable discretionary power . 
At that moment he was conscious that his police agent 's stool was a tribunal . 
He was entering judgment .
