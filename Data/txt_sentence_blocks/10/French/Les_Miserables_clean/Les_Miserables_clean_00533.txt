It was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre . 
But this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him , `` She is losing ground fast . '' 
Then he returned to the town-hall , and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study . 
He wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil . 
THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town , to a Fleming named Master Scaufflaer , French Scaufflaire , who let out `` horses and cabriolets as desired . ''

Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the street , and this person noticed this : After the mayor had passed the priest 's house he halted , stood motionless , then turned about , and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage , which had an iron knocker .
