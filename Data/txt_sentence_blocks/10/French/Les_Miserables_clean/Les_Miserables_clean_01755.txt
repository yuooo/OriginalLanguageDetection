It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall , of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side , of some pier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung . 
Near the table , upon which Marius descried a pen , ink , and paper , sat a man about sixty years of age , small , thin , livid , haggard , with a cunning , cruel , and uneasy air ; a hideous scoundrel . 
If Lavater had studied this visage , he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there , the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other ; the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble , the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible . 
This man had a long gray beard . 
He was clad in a woman 's chemise , which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms , bristling with gray hair , to be seen . 
Beneath this chemise , muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible . 
He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking . 
There was no bread in the hovel , but there was still tobacco . 
He was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius had read . 
On the corner of the table lay an ancient , dilapidated , reddish volume , and the size , which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms , betrayed a romance .
