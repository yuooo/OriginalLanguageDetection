`` The empty coffin remains . '' 
This produced a pause . 
Fauchelevent meditated . 
The prioress meditated . 
`` What is to be done with that coffin , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` It will be given to the earth . '' 
`` Empty ? '' 
Another silence . 
Fauchelevent made , with his left hand , that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject . 
`` Reverend Mother , I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church , and no one can enter there but myself , and I will cover the coffin with the pall . ''
