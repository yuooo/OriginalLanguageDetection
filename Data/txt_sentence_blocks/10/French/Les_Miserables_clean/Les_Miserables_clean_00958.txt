While dreaming and chattering , making tiny outfits , and baby clothes , while sewing little gowns , and corsages and bodices , the child grows into a young girl , the young girl into a big girl , the big girl into a woman . 
The first child is the continuation of the last doll . 
A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy , and quite as impossible , as a woman without children . 
So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword . 
Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man ; `` My husband is right , '' she thought ; `` perhaps it is M. Laffitte ; there are such queer rich men ! '' 
She came and set her elbows on the table . 
`` Monsieur , '' said she . 
At this word , Monsieur , the man turned ; up to that time , the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme . 
`` You see , sir , '' she pursued , assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien , `` I am willing that the child should play ; I do not oppose it , but it is good for once , because you are generous . 
You see , she has nothing ; she must needs work . ''
