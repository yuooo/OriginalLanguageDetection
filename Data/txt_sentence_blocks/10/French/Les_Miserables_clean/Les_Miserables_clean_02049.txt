Was he actually in hiding from the police ? 
The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind . 
It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person . 
So he disguised himself ? 
That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides . 
Why had he not called for help ? 
Why had he fled ? 
Was he , or was he not , the father of the young girl ? 
Was he , in short , the man whom Thenardier thought that he recognized ? 
Thenardier might have been mistaken .
