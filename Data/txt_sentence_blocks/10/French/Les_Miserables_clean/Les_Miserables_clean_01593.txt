To stand between two religions , from one of which you have not as yet emerged , and another into which you have not yet entered , is intolerable ; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls . 
Marius was clear-eyed , and he required the true light . 
The half-lights of doubt pained him . 
Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was , he could not halt there , he was irresistibly constrained to continue , to advance , to examine , to think , to march further . 
Whither would this lead him ? 
He feared , after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father , to now take a step which should estrange him from that father . 
His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him . 
An escarpment rose around him . 
He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends ; daring in the eyes of the one , he was behind the times in the eyes of the others , and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated , on the side of age and on the side of youth . 
He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain .
