My brother bought it while he was in Germany , at Tottlingen , near the sources of the Danube , as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at table . 
`` Madame Magloire returned immediately . 
We said our prayers in the drawing-room , where we hang up the linen , and then we each retired to our own chambers , without saying a word to each other . '' 
TRANQUILLITY After bidding his sister good night , Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table , handed the other to his guest , and said to him , -- `` Monsieur , I will conduct you to your room . '' 
The man followed him . 
As might have been observed from what has been said above , the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated , or to get out of it , it was necessary to traverse the Bishop 's bedroom . 
At the moment when he was crossing this apartment , Madame Magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed . 
This was her last care every evening before she went to bed . 
The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove . 
A fresh white bed had been prepared there .
