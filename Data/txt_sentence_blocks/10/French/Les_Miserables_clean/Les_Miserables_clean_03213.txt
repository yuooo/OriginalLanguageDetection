Such Shrove Tuesdays are no longer to be seen now-a-days . 
Everything which exists being a scattered Carnival , there is no longer any Carnival . 
The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators . 
The terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators . 
Besides the maskers , they stared at that procession -- peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps , -- of vehicles of every description , citadines , tapissieres , carioles , cabriolets marching in order , rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations , and locked into rails , as it were . 
Any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle . 
Police-sergeants maintained , on the sides of the boulevard , these two interminable parallel files , moving in contrary directions , and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current , those two brooks of carriages , flowing , the one down stream , the other up stream , the one towards the Chaussee d'Antin , the other towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine . 
The carriages of the peers of France and of the Ambassadors , emblazoned with coats of arms , held the middle of the way , going and coming freely . 
Certain joyous and magnificent trains , notably that of the Boeuf Gras , had the same privilege . 
In this gayety of Paris , England cracked her whip ; Lord Seymour 's post-chaise , harassed by a nickname from the populace , passed with great noise .
