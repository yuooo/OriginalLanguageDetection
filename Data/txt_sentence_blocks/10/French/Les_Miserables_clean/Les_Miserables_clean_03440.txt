Thenardier had caused the `` honest rustler '' to disappear in his fob , and was gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender . 
Marius broke the silence . 
`` Thenardier , I have told you your name . 
Now , would you like to have me tell you your secret -- the one that you came here to reveal to me ? 
I have information of my own , also . 
You shall see that I know more about it than you do . 
Jean Valjean , as you have said , is an assassin and a thief . 
A thief , because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer , whose ruin he brought about . 
An assassin , because he assassinated police-agent Javert . '' 
`` I do n't understand , sir , '' ejaculated Thenardier .
