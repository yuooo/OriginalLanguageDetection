One of his distant relatives , Madame la Comtesse de Lo , rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating , in his presence , what she designated as `` the expectations '' of her three sons . 
She had numerous relatives , who were very old and near to death , and of whom her sons were the natural heirs . 
The youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income ; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke , his uncle ; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather . 
The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts . 
On one occasion , however , he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual , while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these `` expectations . '' 
She interrupted herself impatiently : `` Mon Dieu , cousin ! 
What are you thinking about ? '' 
`` I am thinking , '' replied the Bishop , `` of a singular remark , which is to be found , I believe , in St. Augustine , -- ` Place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit . ' '' 
At another time , on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side , wherein not only the dignities of the dead man , but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives , spread over an entire page : `` What a stout back Death has ! '' 
he exclaimed .
