And finally , they were not even allowed their sleep ; every night , after a day of toil , they were obliged , in the weariness of their first slumber , at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm , to rouse themselves , to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel , with their knees on the stones . 
On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture , or prostrate , with face upon the pavement , and arms outstretched in the form of a cross . 
The others were men ; these were women . 
What had those men done ? 
They had stolen , violated , pillaged , murdered , assassinated . 
They were bandits , counterfeiters , poisoners , incendiaries , murderers , parricides . 
What had these women done ? 
They had done nothing whatever . 
On the one hand , highway robbery , fraud , deceit , violence , sensuality , homicide , all sorts of sacrilege , every variety of crime ; on the other , one thing only , innocence . 
Perfect innocence , almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption , attached to the earth by virtue , already possessing something of heaven through holiness .
