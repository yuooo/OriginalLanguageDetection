`` What for ? '' 
`` To sit on . '' 
Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from Jondrette . 
`` Pardieu ! 
I 'll go and get one of our neighbor 's . '' 
And with a rapid movement , she opened the door of the den , and went out into the corridor . 
Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode , reach his bed , and conceal himself beneath it . 
`` Take the candle , '' cried Jondrette . 
`` No , '' said she , `` it would embarrass me , I have the two chairs to carry . 
There is moonlight . ''
