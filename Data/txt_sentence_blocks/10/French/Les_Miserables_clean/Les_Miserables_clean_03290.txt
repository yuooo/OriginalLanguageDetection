Ten years ago , I did not know that she was in existence . 
I love her , it is true . 
One loves a child whom one has seen when very young , being old oneself . 
When one is old , one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children . 
You may , it seems to me , suppose that I have something which resembles a heart . 
She was an orphan . 
Without either father or mother . 
She needed me . 
That is why I began to love her . 
Children are so weak that the first comer , even a man like me , can become their protector .
