Martyrdom is sublimation , corrosive sublimation . 
It is a torture which consecrates . 
One can consent to it for the first hour ; one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron , one places on one 's head the crown of hot iron , one accepts the globe of red hot iron , one takes the sceptre of red hot iron , but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned , and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering ? 
At length , Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion . 
He weighed , he reflected , he considered the alternatives , the mysterious balance of light and darkness . 
Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children , or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself ? 
On one side lay the sacrifice of Cosette , on the other that of himself . 
At what solution should he arrive ? 
What decision did he come to ? 
What resolution did he take ?
