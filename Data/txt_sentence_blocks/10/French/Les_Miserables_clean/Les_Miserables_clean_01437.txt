He came and cast the flag at the Emperor 's feet . 
He was covered with blood . 
While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across his face . 
The Emperor , greatly pleased , shouted to him : `` You are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the Legion of Honor ! '' 
Pontmercy replied : `` Sire , I thank you for my widow . '' 
An hour later , he fell in the ravine of Ohain . 
Now , who was this Georges Pontmercy ? 
He was this same `` brigand of the Loire . '' 
We have already seen something of his history . 
After Waterloo , Pontmercy , who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain , as it will be remembered , had succeeded in joining the army , and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire .
