I have seen some people . 
He will come here this evening at six o'clock . 
To bring sixty francs , the rascal ! 
Did you notice how I played that game on him , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of February ? 
I do n't even owe for one quarter ! 
Is n't he a fool ! 
So he will come at six o'clock ! 
That 's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner . 
Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city . 
There 's not a soul in the house .
