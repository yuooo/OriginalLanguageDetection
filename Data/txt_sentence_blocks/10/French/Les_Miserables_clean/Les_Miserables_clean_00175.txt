Nature had made her a lamb , religion had made her an angel . 
Poor sainted virgin ! 
Sweet memory which has vanished ! 
Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening , that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details . 
At the moment when the Bishop entered , Madame Magloire was talking with considerable vivacity . 
She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also accustomed . 
The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door . 
It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper , Madame Magloire had heard things in divers places . 
People had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance ; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town , and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters . 
The police was very badly organized , moreover , because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor , who sought to injure each other by making things happen .
