There , no more than elsewhere , did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment . 
The prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney-coachman . 
They had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of June at the mouth of the Grand Sewer . 
No report of any agent had been received there upon this matter , which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable . 
The invention of this fable was attributed to the coachman . 
A coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything , even of imagination . 
The fact was assured , nevertheless , and Marius could not doubt it , unless he doubted his own identity , as we have just said . 
Everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable . 
What had become of that man , that mysterious man , whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious Marius , and whom the police-agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent ? 
What had become of the agent himself ?
