He held both these arms with one hand , and groped along the wall with the other . 
Marius ' cheek touched his , and clung there , bleeding . 
He felt a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes . 
But a humid warmth near his ear , which the mouth of the wounded man touched , indicated respiration , and consequently , life . 
The passage along which Jean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first . 
Jean Valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty . 
The rain of the preceding day had not , as yet , entirely run off , and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom , and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water . 
Thus he proceeded in the gloom . 
He resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow . 
Still , little by little , whether it was that the distant air-holes emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom , or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity , some vague vision returned to him , and he began once more to gain a confused idea , now of the wall which he touched , now of the vault beneath which he was passing .
