A word was sufficient for him , sometimes a sign ; the mastodon obeyed . 
Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in Madame Thenardier 's eyes , though she did not thoroughly realize it . 
She was possessed of virtues after her own kind ; if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with `` Monsieur Thenardier , '' -- which was an inadmissible hypothesis , by the way , -- she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever . 
She would never have committed `` before strangers '' that mistake so often committed by women , and which is called in parliamentary language , `` exposing the crown . '' 
Although their concord had only evil as its result , there was contemplation in Madame Thenardier 's submission to her husband . 
That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot . 
Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side , this was that grand and universal thing , the adoration of mind by matter ; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty . 
There was an unknown quantity about Thenardier ; hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman . 
At certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle ; at others she felt him like a claw . 
This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children , and who did not fear any one except her husband .
