`` That is true ; you remind me of that ; he will not bear it . '' 
`` Then -- '' `` But I can surely hire a horse in the village ? '' 
`` A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts . 
You would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you . 
But you will not find one for sale nor to let , for five hundred francs , or for a thousand . '' 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
`` The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man , and set out on your journey to-morrow . ''
