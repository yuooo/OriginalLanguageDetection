Had he , in lending to this stranger the aid of his key , and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal , the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin ?

Thenardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders , then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe , and barefooted , making Jean Valjean a sign to follow him , looked out , laid his finger on his mouth , and remained for several seconds , as though in suspense ; his inspection finished , he placed the key in the lock . 
The bolt slipped back and the gate swung open . 
It neither grated nor squeaked . 
It moved very softly . 
It was obvious that this gate and those hinges , carefully oiled , were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed . 
This softness was suspicious ; it hinted at furtive goings and comings , silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men , and the wolf-like tread of crime . 
The sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band . 
This taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods .
