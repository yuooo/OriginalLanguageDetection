Javert , you deserve promotion instead of degradation .

Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes , in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible , and said in a tranquil voice : -- `` Mr. Mayor , I can not grant you that . '' 
`` I repeat , '' replied M. Madeleine , `` that the matter concerns me . '' 
But Javert , heeding his own thought only , continued : -- `` So far as exaggeration is concerned , I am not exaggerating . 
This is the way I reason : I have suspected you unjustly . 
That is nothing . 
It is our right to cherish suspicion , although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse .
