Perhaps she did not know herself . 
Every morning she went to a printing office , No. 3 Rue du Sabot , where she was a folder and stitcher . 
She was obliged to be there at six o'clock in the morning -- long before daylight in winter . 
In the same building with the printing office there was a school , and to this school she took her little boy , who was seven years old . 
But as she entered the printing office at six , and the school only opened at seven , the child had to wait in the courtyard , for the school to open , for an hour -- one hour of a winter night in the open air ! 
They would not allow the child to come into the printing office , because he was in the way , they said . 
When the workmen passed in the morning , they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement , overcome with drowsiness , and often fast asleep in the shadow , crouched down and doubled up over his basket . 
When it rained , an old woman , the portress , took pity on him ; she took him into her den , where there was a pallet , a spinning-wheel , and two wooden chairs , and the little one slumbered in a corner , pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold . 
At seven o'clock the school opened , and he entered . 
That is what was told to Jean Valjean .
