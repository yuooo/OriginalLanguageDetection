The man resumed his writing . 
STRATEGY AND TACTICS Marius , with a load upon his breast , was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised , when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post . 
The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly . 
The eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold . 
On her feet , she had large , coarse , men 's shoes , bespattered with mud , which had splashed even to her red ankles , and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters . 
Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously , but she had probably deposited it at his door , in order that she might inspire the more pity , and had picked it up again on emerging . 
She entered , pushed the door to behind her , paused to take breath , for she was completely breathless , then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy : -- `` He is coming ! '' 
The father turned his eyes towards her , the woman turned her head , the little sister did not stir . 
`` Who ? '' 
demanded her father .
