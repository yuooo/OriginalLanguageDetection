The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute , who had failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds . 
Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette 's absence to return home ; moreover , it was growing late ; every evening , Ma'am Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town , had a habit of locking the door , which was always closed at dusk . 
Marius had given his key to the inspector of police ; it was important , therefore , that he should make haste . 
Evening had arrived , night had almost closed in ; on the horizon and in the immensity of space , there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun , and that was the moon . 
It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere . 
Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides . 
The door was still open when he arrived . 
He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber . 
This corridor , as the reader will remember , was bordered on both sides by attics , all of which were , for the moment , empty and to let . 
Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open .
