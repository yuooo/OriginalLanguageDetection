When work is abundant , when the country is rich and happy , the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing . 
It may be said , that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches , -- the cost of collecting the taxes . 
In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M. , and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villele , then Minister of Finance . 
Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither . 
No one remembered her . 
Fortunately , the door of M. Madeleine 's factory was like the face of a friend . 
She presented herself there , and was admitted to the women 's workroom . 
The trade was entirely new to Fantine ; she could not be very skilful at it , and she therefore earned but little by her day 's work ; but it was sufficient ; the problem was solved ; she was earning her living .

To live honestly by her own labor , what mercy from heaven !
