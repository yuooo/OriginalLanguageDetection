My drawing-room , which contains no furniture , and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing , is fifteen feet in height , eighteen square , with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded , and with beams , as in yours . 
This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital . 
And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers . 
But my room is the one you ought to see . 
Madam Magloire has discovered , under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top , some paintings , which without being good are very tolerable . 
The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens , the name of which escapes me . 
In short , where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night . 
What shall I say to you ? 
I have Romans , and Roman ladies -LSB- here occurs an illegible word -RSB- , and the whole train . 
Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off ; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired , and the whole revarnished , and my chamber will be a regular museum .
