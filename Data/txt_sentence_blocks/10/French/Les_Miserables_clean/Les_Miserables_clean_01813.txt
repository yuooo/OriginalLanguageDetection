Both of you . 
I shall need you . '' 
Marius redoubled his attention .

Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman 's chemise which he wore into his trousers .

The young lady -- '' `` Well , what ? '' 
retorted his wife , `` the young lady ? '' 
Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking .
