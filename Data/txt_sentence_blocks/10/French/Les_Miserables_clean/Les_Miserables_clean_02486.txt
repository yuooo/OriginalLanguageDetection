On the following day , on the day after , and on the day after that , it had to be done again . 
M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin . 
As the second-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell , they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs , sometimes at those very shops . 
Volume by volume , the whole library went the same road . 
He said at times : `` But I am eighty ; '' as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books . 
His melancholy increased . 
Once , however , he had a pleasure . 
He had gone out with a Robert Estienne , which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais , and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the Rue des Gres . 
-- `` I owe five sous , '' he said , beaming on Mother Plutarque . 
That day he had no dinner .
