A little roughness is good in cases of fear . 
It is reassuring . 
The two children drew close to Gavroche . 
Gavroche , paternally touched by this confidence , passed from grave to gentle , and addressing the smaller : -- `` Stupid , '' said he , accenting the insulting word , with a caressing intonation , `` it 's outside that it is black . 
Outside it 's raining , here it does not rain ; outside it 's cold , here there 's not an atom of wind ; outside there are heaps of people , here there 's no one ; outside there ai n't even the moon , here there 's my candle , confound it ! '' 
The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror ; but Gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation . 
`` Quick , '' said he . 
And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room . 
There stood his bed . 
Gavroche 's bed was complete ; that is to say , it had a mattress , a blanket , and an alcove with curtains .
