`` And you ? '' 
`` I ? 
I work . '' 
`` All day long ? '' 
The child raised her great eyes , in which hung a tear , which was not visible because of the darkness , and replied gently : -- `` Yes , sir . '' 
After an interval of silence she went on : -- `` Sometimes , when I have finished my work and they let me , I amuse myself , too . '' 
`` How do you amuse yourself ? '' 
`` In the best way I can . 
They let me alone ; but I have not many playthings . 
Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls .
