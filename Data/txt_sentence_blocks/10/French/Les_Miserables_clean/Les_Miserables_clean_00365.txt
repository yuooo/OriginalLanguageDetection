She was pale ; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance . 
She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child . 
A large blue handkerchief , such as the Invalides use , was folded into a fichu , and concealed her figure clumsily . 
Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles , her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle ; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff , a linen gown , and coarse shoes . 
It was Fantine . 
It was Fantine , but difficult to recognize . 
Nevertheless , on scrutinizing her attentively , it was evident that she still retained her beauty . 
A melancholy fold , which resembled the beginning of irony , wrinkled her right cheek . 
As for her toilette , that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons , which seemed made of mirth , of folly , and of music , full of bells , and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight ; it melts and leaves the branch quite black . 
Ten months had elapsed since the `` pretty farce . ''
