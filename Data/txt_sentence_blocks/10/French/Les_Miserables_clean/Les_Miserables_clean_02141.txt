Marius was not there . 
On the following day , Jean Valjean asked Cosette again : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? '' 
She replied , sadly and gently : -- `` No . '' 
Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness , and heart-broken at this gentleness . 
What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable ? 
What was on its way there within ? 
What was taking place in Cosette 's soul ? 
Sometimes , instead of going to bed , Jean Valjean remained seated on his pallet , with his head in his hands , and he passed whole nights asking himself : `` What has Cosette in her mind ? '' 
and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about . 
Oh !
