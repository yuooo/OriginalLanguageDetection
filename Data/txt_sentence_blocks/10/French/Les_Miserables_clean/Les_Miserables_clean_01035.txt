The early days passed in this dazzled state . 
Cosette , on her side , had also , unknown to herself , become another being , poor little thing ! 
She was so little when her mother left her , that she no longer remembered her . 
Like all children , who resemble young shoots of the vine , which cling to everything , she had tried to love ; she had not succeeded . 
All had repulsed her , -- the Thenardiers , their children , other children . 
She had loved the dog , and he had died , after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her . 
It is a sad thing to say , and we have already intimated it , that , at eight years of age , her heart was cold . 
It was not her fault ; it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked ; alas ! 
it was the possibility . 
Thus , from the very first day , all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man .
