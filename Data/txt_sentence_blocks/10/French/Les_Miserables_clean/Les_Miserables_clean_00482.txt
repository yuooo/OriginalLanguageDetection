One step more and she would be in the street . 
Javert up to that moment had remained erect , motionless , with his eyes fixed on the ground , cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue , which is waiting to be put away somewhere . 
The sound of the latch roused him . 
He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority , an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level , ferocious in the wild beast , atrocious in the man of no estate . 
`` Sergeant ! '' 
he cried , `` do n't you see that that jade is walking off ! 
Who bade you let her go ? '' 
`` I , '' said Madeleine . 
Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert 's voice , and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen . 
At the sound of Madeleine 's voice she turned around , and from that moment forth she uttered no word , nor dared so much as to breathe freely , but her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert , and from Javert to Madeleine in turn , according to which was speaking .
