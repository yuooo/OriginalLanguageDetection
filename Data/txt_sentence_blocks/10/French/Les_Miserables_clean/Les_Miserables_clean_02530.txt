Nothing is , generally , more singularly calm than the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters . 
Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything , -- it is only a riot , -- and Paris has so many affairs on hand , that she does not put herself out for so small a matter . 
These colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles . 
These immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity . 
Ordinarily , when an insurrection commences , when the shop-keeper hears the drum , the call to arms , the general alarm , he contents himself with the remark : -- `` There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin . '' 
Or : -- `` In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine . '' 
Often he adds carelessly : -- `` Or somewhere in that direction . '' 
Later on , when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible , the shopkeeper says : -- `` It 's getting hot ! 
Hullo , it 's getting hot ! '' 
A moment later , the riot approaches and gains in force , he shuts up his shop precipitately , hastily dons his uniform , that is to say , he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person .
