And we have been as foolish as you . 
Do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe , because your trip-gallant is called the cholera-morbus , and because your pourree is called the cachuca . 
In fact , the women must always be loved . 
I defy you to escape from that . 
These friends are our angels . 
Yes , love , woman , the kiss forms a circle from which I defy you to escape ; and , for my own part , I should be only too happy to re-enter it . 
Which of you has seen the planet Venus , the coquette of the abyss , the Celimene of the ocean , rise in the infinite , calming all here below ? 
The ocean is a rough Alcestis . 
Well , grumble as he will , when Venus appears he is forced to smile . 
That brute beast submits .
