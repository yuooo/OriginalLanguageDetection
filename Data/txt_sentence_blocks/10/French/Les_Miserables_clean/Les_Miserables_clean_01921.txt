Thenardier continued : -- `` Come instantly -- '' He paused : -- `` You address her as thou , do you not ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked M. Leblanc . 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
cried Thenardier , `` the little one , the Lark . '' 
M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion : -- `` I do not know what you mean . '' 
`` Go on , nevertheless , '' ejaculated Thenardier , and he continued to dictate : -- `` Come immediately , I am in absolute need of thee . 
The person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me . 
I am waiting for thee . 
Come with confidence . ''
