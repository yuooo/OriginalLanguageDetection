`` Play ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
The day passed thus . 
Cosette , without troubling herself to understand anything , was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man . 
TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE On the following morning , at daybreak , Jean Valjean was still by Cosette 's bedside ; he watched there motionless , waiting for her to wake . 
Some new thing had come into his soul . 
Jean Valjean had never loved anything ; for twenty-five years he had been alone in the world . 
He had never been father , lover , husband , friend . 
In the prison he had been vicious , gloomy , chaste , ignorant , and shy . 
The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity .
