We furnish supper and bed here . '' 
He entered . 
All the men who were drinking turned round . 
The lamp illuminated him on one side , the firelight on the other . 
They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack . 
The host said to him , `` There is the fire . 
The supper is cooking in the pot . 
Come and warm yourself , comrade . '' 
He approached and seated himself near the hearth . 
He stretched out his feet , which were exhausted with fatigue , to the fire ; a fine odor was emitted by the pot .
