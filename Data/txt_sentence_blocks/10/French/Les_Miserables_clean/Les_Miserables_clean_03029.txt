This torch of the names of the streets of Paris , with which we are illuminating for the reader Jean Valjean 's subterranean march , Jean Valjean himself did not possess . 
Nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing , nor what way he had made . 
Only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement , and that the day would soon be over ; and the rolling of vehicles overhead , having become intermittent instead of continuous , then having almost ceased , he concluded that he was no longer under central Paris , and that he was approaching some solitary region , in the vicinity of the outer boulevards , or the extreme outer quays . 
Where there are fewer houses and streets , the sewer has fewer air-holes . 
The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean . 
Nevertheless , he continued to advance , groping his way in the dark .

It sometimes happens , that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland a man , either a traveller or a fisherman , while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore , suddenly notices that for several minutes past , he has been walking with some difficulty . 
The beach under foot is like pitch ; his soles stick fast to it ; it is no longer sand , it is bird-lime .
