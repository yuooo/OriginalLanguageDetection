For days he had neither eaten nor slept . 
He threw himself into one of the arm-chairs . 
Basque returned , set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired . 
Jean Valjean , his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast , perceived neither Basque nor the candle . 
All at once , he drew himself up with a start . 
Cosette was standing beside him . 
He had not seen her enter , but he had felt that she was there . 
He turned round . 
He gazed at her . 
She was adorably lovely .
