The coachman , a black form on his box , whipped up his thin horses . 
A glacial silence reigned in the carriage . 
Marius , motionless , with his body resting in the corner , and his head drooping on his breast , his arms hanging , his legs stiff , seemed to be awaiting only a coffin ; Jean Valjean seemed made of shadow , and Javert of stone , and in that vehicle full of night , whose interior , every time that it passed in front of a street lantern , appeared to be turned lividly wan , as by an intermittent flash of lightning , chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility , the corpse , the spectre , and the statue . 
RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE At every jolt over the pavement , a drop of blood trickled from Marius ' hair . 
Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6 , Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire . 
Javert was the first to alight ; he made sure with one glance of the number on the carriage gate , and , raising the heavy knocker of beaten iron , embellished in the old style , with a male goat and a satyr confronting each other , he gave a violent peal . 
The gate opened a little way and Javert gave it a push . 
The porter half made his appearance yawning , vaguely awake , and with a candle in his hand . 
Everyone in the house was asleep . 
People go to bed betimes in the Marais , especially on days when there is a revolt .
