They intended to bring up the child in their own way . 
Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions , but he submitted to them , thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself . 
The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much ; but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable . 
This aunt , who had remained unmarried , was very rich on the maternal side , and her sister 's son was her natural heir . 
The boy , whose name was Marius , knew that he had a father , but nothing more . 
No one opened his mouth to him about it . 
Nevertheless , in the society into which his grandfather took him , whispers , innuendoes , and winks , had eventually enlightened the little boy 's mind ; he had finally understood something of the case , and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were , so to speak , the air he breathed , by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration , he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart . 
While he was growing up in this fashion , the colonel slipped away every two or three months , came to Paris on the sly , like a criminal breaking his ban , and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice , at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass . 
There , trembling lest the aunt should turn round , concealed behind a pillar , motionless , not daring to breathe , he gazed at his child . 
The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster .
