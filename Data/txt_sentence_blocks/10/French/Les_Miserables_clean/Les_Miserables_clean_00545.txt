Meanwhile , M. Madeleine had returned home . 
He had taken the longest way to return from Master Scaufflaire 's , as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him , and he had wished to avoid it . 
He ascended to his room , and there he shut himself up , which was a very simple act , since he liked to go to bed early . 
Nevertheless , the portress of the factory , who was , at the same time , M. Madeleine 's only servant , noticed that the latter 's light was extinguished at half-past eight , and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home , adding : -- `` Is Monsieur le Maire ill ? 
I thought he had a rather singular air . '' 
This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine 's chamber . 
He paid no heed to the portress 's words , but went to bed and to sleep . 
Towards midnight he woke up with a start ; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head . 
He listened ; it was a footstep pacing back and forth , as though some one were walking in the room above him . 
He listened more attentively , and recognized M. Madeleine 's step .
