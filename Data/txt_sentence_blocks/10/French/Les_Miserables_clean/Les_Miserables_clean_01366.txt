Lastly , he has his own fauna , which he observes attentively in the corners ; the lady-bird , the death 's - head plant-louse , the daddy-long-legs , `` the devil , '' a black insect , which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns . 
He has his fabulous monster , which has scales under its belly , but is not a lizard , which has pustules on its back , but is not a toad , which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that have run dry , which is black , hairy , sticky , which crawls sometimes slowly , sometimes rapidly , which has no cry , but which has a look , and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it ; he calls this monster `` the deaf thing . '' 
The search for these `` deaf things '' among the stones is a joy of formidable nature . 
Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving-stone , and taking a look at the wood-lice . 
Each region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there . 
There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines , there are millepeds in the Pantheon , there are tadpoles in the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars . 
As far as sayings are concerned , this child has as many of them as Talleyrand . 
He is no less cynical , but he is more honest . 
He is endowed with a certain indescribable , unexpected joviality ; he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter . 
He ranges boldly from high comedy to farce .
