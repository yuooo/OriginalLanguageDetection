The little man of six had a big brioche . 
At that epoch , certain houses abutting on the river , in the Rues Madame and d'Enfer , had keys to the Luxembourg garden , of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut , a privilege which was suppressed later on . 
This father and son came from one of these houses , no doubt . 
The two poor little creatures watched `` that gentleman '' approaching , and hid themselves a little more thoroughly . 
He was a bourgeois . 
The same person , perhaps , whom Marius had one day heard , through his love fever , near the same grand basin , counselling his son `` to avoid excesses . '' 
He had an affable and haughty air , and a mouth which was always smiling , since it did not shut . 
This mechanical smile , produced by too much jaw and too little skin , shows the teeth rather than the soul . 
The child , with his brioche , which he had bitten into but had not finished eating , seemed satiated . 
The child was dressed as a National Guardsman , owing to the insurrection , and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence .
