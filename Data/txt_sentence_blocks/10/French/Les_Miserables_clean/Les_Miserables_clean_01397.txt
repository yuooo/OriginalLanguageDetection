Let us return to that cry : Light ! 
and let us obstinately persist therein ! 
Light ! 
Light ! 
Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent ? 
Are not revolutions transfigurations ? 
Come , philosophers , teach , enlighten , light up , think aloud , speak aloud , hasten joyously to the great sun , fraternize with the public place , announce the good news , spend your alphabets lavishly , proclaim rights , sing the Marseillaises , sow enthusiasms , tear green boughs from the oaks . 
Make a whirlwind of the idea . 
This crowd may be rendered sublime . 
Let us learn how to make use of that vast conflagration of principles and virtues , which sparkles , bursts forth and quivers at certain hours .
