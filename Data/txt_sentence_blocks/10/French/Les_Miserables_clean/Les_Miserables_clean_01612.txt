`` What , '' he thought , `` when my father lay dying on the field of battle , did Thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grape-shot , and bear him off on his shoulders , and yet he owed him nothing , and I , who owe so much to Thenardier , can not join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death , and in my turn bring him back from death to life ! 
Oh ! 
I will find him ! '' 
To find Thenardier , in fact , Marius would have given one of his arms , to rescue him from his misery , he would have sacrificed all his blood . 
To see Thenardier , to render Thenardier some service , to say to him : `` You do not know me ; well , I do know you ! 
Here I am . 
Dispose of me ! '' 
This was Marius ' sweetest and most magnificent dream . 
MARIUS GROWN UP At this epoch , Marius was twenty years of age . 
It was three years since he had left his grandfather .
