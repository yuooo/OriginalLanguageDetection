The Thenardier , dishevelled and terrible , set her feet far apart , threw herself backwards , and hurled the paving-stone at Javert 's head . 
Javert ducked , the stone passed over him , struck the wall behind , knocked off a huge piece of plastering , and , rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel , now luckily almost empty , rested at Javert 's feet . 
At the same moment , Javert reached the Thenardier couple . 
One of his big hands descended on the woman 's shoulder ; the other on the husband 's head . 
`` The handcuffs ! '' 
he shouted . 
The policemen trooped in in force , and in a few seconds Javert 's order had been executed . 
The Thenardier female , overwhelmed , stared at her pinioned hands , and at those of her husband , who had dropped to the floor , and exclaimed , weeping : -- `` My daughters ! '' 
`` They are in the jug , '' said Javert . 
In the meanwhile , the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door , and were shaking him : -- He awoke , stammering : -- `` Is it all over , Jondrette ? ''
