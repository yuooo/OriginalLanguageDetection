The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls . 
Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take . 
The Royalists were becoming liberals , liberals were turning democrats . 
It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements ; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures ; hence the combination of very singular ideas ; people adored both Napoleon and liberty . 
We are making history here . 
These were the mirages of that period . 
Opinions traverse phases . 
Voltairian royalism , a quaint variety , had a no less singular sequel , Bonapartist liberalism . 
Other groups of minds were more serious . 
In that direction , they sounded principles , they attached themselves to the right .
