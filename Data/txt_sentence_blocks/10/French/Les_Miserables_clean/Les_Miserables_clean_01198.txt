Superstitions , bigotries , affected devotion , prejudices , those forms all forms as they are , are tenacious of life ; they have teeth and nails in their smoke , and they must be clasped close , body to body , and war must be made on them , and that without truce ; for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms . 
It is difficult to seize darkness by the throat , and to hurl it to the earth . 
A convent in France , in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century , is a college of owls facing the light . 
A cloister , caught in the very act of asceticism , in the very heart of the city of '89 and of 1830 and of 1848 , Rome blossoming out in Paris , is an anachronism . 
In ordinary times , in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish , one has only to make it spell out the date . 
But we are not in ordinary times . 
Let us fight . 
Let us fight , but let us make a distinction . 
The peculiar property of truth is never to commit excesses . 
What need has it of exaggeration ?
