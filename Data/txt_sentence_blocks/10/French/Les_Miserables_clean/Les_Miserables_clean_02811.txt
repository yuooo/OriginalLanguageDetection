Men shouted to Marius from the groups : `` Do you designate who is to remain . '' 
`` Yes , '' said the five , `` choose . 
We will obey you . '' 
Marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion . 
Still , at this idea , that of choosing a man for death , his blood rushed back to his heart . 
He would have turned pale , had it been possible for him to become any paler . 
He advanced towards the five , who smiled upon him , and each , with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history hovering over Thermopylae , cried to him : `` Me ! 
me ! 
me ! '' 
And Marius stupidly counted them ; there were still five of them !
