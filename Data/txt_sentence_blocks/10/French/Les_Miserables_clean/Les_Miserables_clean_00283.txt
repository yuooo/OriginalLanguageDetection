In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais , and had robbed him of his forty sous . 
Why ? 
He certainly could not have explained it ; was this the last effect and the supreme effort , as it were , of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys , -- a remnant of impulse , a result of what is called in statics , acquired force ?
