In venery this is called false re-imbushment . 
The moon was full that night . 
Jean Valjean was not sorry for this . 
The moon , still very close to the horizon , cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets . 
Jean Valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side , and yet keep watch on the light side . 
He did not , perhaps , take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him . 
Still , in the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue Poliveau , he thought he felt certain that no one was following him . 
Cosette walked on without asking any questions . 
The sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature . 
Moreover , -- and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur , -- she had grown used , without being herself aware of it , to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny .
