One would have said that he knew who I was . 
I went into the fields , intending to sleep in the open air , beneath the stars . 
There were no stars . 
I thought it was going to rain , and I re-entered the town , to seek the recess of a doorway . 
Yonder , in the square , I meant to sleep on a stone bench . 
A good woman pointed out your house to me , and said to me , ` Knock there ! ' 
I have knocked . 
What is this place ? 
Do you keep an inn ? 
I have money -- savings .
