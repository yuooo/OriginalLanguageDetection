he repeated imperiously . 
There was no reply . 
All was over . 
No one in the garden ; no one in the house . 
Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house , which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty . 
He gazed at the stone seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette . 
Then he seated himself on the flight of steps , his heart filled with sweetness and resolution , he blessed his love in the depths of his thought , and he said to himself that , since Cosette was gone , all that there was left for him was to die . 
All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street , and which was calling to him through the trees : -- `` Mr. Marius ! '' 
He started to his feet . 
`` Hey ? ''
