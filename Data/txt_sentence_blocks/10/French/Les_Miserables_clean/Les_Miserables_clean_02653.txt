He set out at rapid pace . 
He found himself most opportunely armed , as he had Javert 's pistols with him . 
The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse , had vanished from his sight in the street . 
Marius , who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard , traversed the Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides , the Champs Elysees , the Place Louis XV. , and reached the Rue de Rivoli . 
The shops were open there , the gas was burning under the arcades , women were making their purchases in the stalls , people were eating ices in the Cafe Laiter , and nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook 's shop . 
Only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel des Princes and the Hotel Meurice . 
Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme . 
There the shops were closed , the merchants were chatting in front of their half-open doors , people were walking about , the street lanterns were lighted , beginning with the first floor , all the windows were lighted as usual . 
There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal . 
Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honore .
