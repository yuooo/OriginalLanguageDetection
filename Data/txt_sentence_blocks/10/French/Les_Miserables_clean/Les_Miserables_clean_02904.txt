A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly , the principal architect , allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels . 
This armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased . 
The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there , and , if possible , a breach for the assault . 
When the stones destined to the final defence were in place , Enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay , carried to the first floor . 
`` Who is to drink that ? '' 
Bossuet asked him . 
`` They , '' replied Enjolras . 
Then they barricaded the window below , and held in readiness the iron cross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night . 
The fortress was complete . 
The barricade was the rampart , the wine-shop was the dungeon .
