The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets , their bear-skin caps , and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces . 
Marius had no longer any weapons ; he had flung away his discharged pistols after firing them ; but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in the tap-room , near the door . 
As he turned half round , gazing in that direction , a soldier took aim at him . 
At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius , a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it . 
This was done by some one who had darted forward , -- the young workman in velvet trousers . 
The shot sped , traversed the hand and possibly , also , the workman , since he fell , but the ball did not strike Marius . 
All this , which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke , Marius , who was entering the tap-room , hardly noticed . 
Still , he had , in a confused way , perceived that gun-barrel aimed at him , and the hand which had blocked it , and he had heard the discharge . 
But in moments like this , the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated , and one pauses for nothing . 
One feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still , and all is cloud .
