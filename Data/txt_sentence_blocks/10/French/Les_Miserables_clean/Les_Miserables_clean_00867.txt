The Voltairians added , `` Will Boulatruelle catch the devil , or will the devil catch Boulatruelle ? '' 
The old women made a great many signs of the cross . 
In the meantime , Boulatruelle 's manoeuvres in the forest ceased ; and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending ; and people gossiped of something else . 
Some persons , however , were still curious , surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends , but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil 's bank-bills , and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret . 
The most `` puzzled '' were the school-master and Thenardier , the proprietor of the tavern , who was everybody 's friend , and had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle . 
`` He has been in the galleys , '' said Thenardier . 
`` Eh ! 
Good God ! 
no one knows who has been there or will be there . '' 
One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest , and that the latter would have been forced to speak , and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need , and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test , for example .
