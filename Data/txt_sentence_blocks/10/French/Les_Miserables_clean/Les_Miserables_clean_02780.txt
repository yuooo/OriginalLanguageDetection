One seemed a maw ; the other a mask . 
Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composed of a wrath and of an enigma , one divined in the first barricade the dragon , and behind the second the sphinx . 
These two fortresses had been erected by two men named , the one , Cournet , the other , Barthelemy . 
Cournet made the Saint-Antoine barricade ; Barthelemy the barricade of the Temple . 
Each was the image of the man who had built it . 
Cournet was a man of lofty stature ; he had broad shoulders , a red face , a crushing fist , a bold heart , a loyal soul , a sincere and terrible eye . 
Intrepid , energetic , irascible , stormy ; the most cordial of men , the most formidable of combatants . 
War , strife , conflict , were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor . 
He had been an officer in the navy , and , from his gestures and his voice , one divined that he sprang from the ocean , and that he came from the tempest ; he carried the hurricane on into battle . 
With the exception of the genius , there was in Cournet something of Danton , as , with the exception of the divinity , there was in Danton something of Hercules .
