The top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean , where Wellington is ; the lower left tip is Hougomont , where Reille is stationed with Jerome Bonaparte ; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance , where Napoleon was . 
At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced . 
It was there that the lion has been placed , the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard . 
The triangle included in the top of the A , between the two limbs and the tie , is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean . 
The dispute over this plateau constituted the whole battle . 
The wings of the two armies extended to the right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles ; d'Erlon facing Picton , Reille facing Hill . 
Behind the tip of the A , behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean , is the forest of Soignes . 
As for the plain itself , let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground ; each rise commands the next rise , and all the undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean , and there end in the forest . 
Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers . 
It is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist .
