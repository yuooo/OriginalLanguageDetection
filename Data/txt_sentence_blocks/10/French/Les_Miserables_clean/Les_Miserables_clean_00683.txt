He is not the man whom you are in search of ; it is I : I am Jean Valjean . '' 
Not a mouth breathed ; the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave ; those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done . 
In the meantime , the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and sadness ; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a few low-toned words with the assistant judges ; he addressed the public , and asked in accents which all understood : -- `` Is there a physician present ? '' 
The district-attorney took the word : -- `` Gentlemen of the jury , the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us , like yourselves , only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express . 
You all know , by reputation at least , the honorable M. Madeleine , mayor of M. sur M. ; if there is a physician in the audience , we join the President in requesting him to attend to M. Madeleine , and to conduct him to his home . '' 
M.Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish ; he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority . 
These are the words which he uttered ; here they are literally , as they were written down , immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene , and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago : -- `` I thank you , Mr. District-Attorney , but I am not mad ; you shall see ; you were on the point of committing a great error ; release this man ! 
I am fulfilling a duty ; I am that miserable criminal . 
I am the only one here who sees the matter clearly , and I am telling you the truth . 
God , who is on high , looks down on what I am doing at this moment , and that suffices .
