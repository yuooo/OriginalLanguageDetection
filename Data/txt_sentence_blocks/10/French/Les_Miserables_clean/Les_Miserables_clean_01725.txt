I sick since my last confinement , abandoned by my husband five months ago , haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance . 
In the hope of Madame la Comtesse , she has the honor to be , Madame , with profound respect , Mistress Balizard . 
Marius turned to the third letter , which was a petition like the preceding ; he read : -- Monsieur Pabourgeot , Elector , wholesale stocking merchant , Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers . 
I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the Theatre-Francais . 
The subject is historical , and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire ; the style , I think , is natural , laconic , and may have some merit . 
There are couplets to be sung in four places . 
The comic , the serious , the unexpected , are mingled in a variety of characters , and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously , and ends , after striking altarations , in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes . 
My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century , that is to say , the fashion , that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind . 
In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy , the egotism of priviliged authors , may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre , for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which new-comers are treated . 
Monsiuer Pabourgeot , your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you , lacking bread and fire in this wynter season .
