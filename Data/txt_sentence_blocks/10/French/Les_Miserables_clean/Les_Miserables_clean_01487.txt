Lieutenant Theodule stood before her , making the regulation salute . 
She uttered a cry of delight . 
One may be old , one may be a prude , one may be pious , one may be an aunt , but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one 's chamber . 
`` You here , Theodule ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
`` On my way through town , aunt . '' 
`` Embrace me . '' 
`` Here goes ! '' 
said Theodule . 
And he kissed her .
