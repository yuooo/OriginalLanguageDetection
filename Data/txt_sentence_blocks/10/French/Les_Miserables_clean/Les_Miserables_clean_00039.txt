He visited the poor so long as he had any money ; when he no longer had any , he visited the rich . 
As he made his cassocks last a long while , and did not wish to have it noticed , he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak . 
This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer . 
On his return , he dined . 
The dinner resembled his breakfast . 
At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister , Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table . 
Nothing could be more frugal than this repast . 
If , however , the Bishop had one of his cures to supper , Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake , or with some fine game from the mountains . 
Every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal : the Bishop did not interfere . 
With that exception , his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water , and oil soup .
