We will not conduct the reader either to the mayor 's office or to the church . 
One does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent , and one is accustomed to turn one 's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole . 
We will confine ourselves to noting an incident which , though unnoticed by the wedding party , marked the transit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul . 
At that epoch , the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in process of repaving . 
It was barred off , beginning with the Rue du Pare-Royal . 
It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to Saint-Paul . 
They were obliged to alter their course , and the simplest way was to turn through the boulevard . 
One of the invited guests observed that it was Shrove Tuesday , and that there would be a jam of vehicles . 
-- `` Why ? '' 
asked M. Gillenormand -- `` Because of the maskers . ''
