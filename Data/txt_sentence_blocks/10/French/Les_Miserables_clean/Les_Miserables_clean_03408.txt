His cheeks were pendulous ; the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it ; the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs . 
He gazed into space with an air of reproach ; one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one . 
He was in that condition , the last phase of dejection , in which sorrow no longer flows ; it is coagulated , so to speak ; there is something on the soul like a clot of despair . 
Night had come . 
He laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair to the fireside , and placed upon the table a pen , some ink and some paper . 
That done , he had a fainting fit . 
When he recovered consciousness , he was thirsty . 
As he could not lift the jug , he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth , and swallowed a draught . 
As neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time , the point of the pen had curled up , the ink had dried away , he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink , which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times , and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen . 
He wiped his brow from time to time .
