One would have said that , while desirous of reaching his destination , he feared the moment when he should be close at hand . 
When only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened , to such a degree that , at times , one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all . 
The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole . 
Whatever time he spent on arriving , he was obliged to arrive at last ; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire ; then he halted , he trembled , he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house , and gazed into that street , and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible , and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him . 
Then a tear , which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids , and had become large enough to fall , trickled down his cheek , and sometimes stopped at his mouth . 
The old man tasted its bitter flavor . 
Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone , then he returned by the same road and with the same step , and , in proportion as he retreated , his glance died out . 
Little by little , this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire ; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis ; sometimes a little further off , sometimes a little nearer . 
One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine and looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance . 
Then he shook his head slowly from right to left , as though refusing himself something , and retraced his steps .
