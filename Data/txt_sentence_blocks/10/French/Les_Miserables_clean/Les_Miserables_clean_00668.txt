She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges , where the water comes through faucets . 
You are not in the tub there ; you wash at the faucet in front of you , and rinse in a basin behind you . 
As it is enclosed , you are not so cold ; but there is that hot steam , which is terrible , and which ruins your eyes . 
She came home at seven o'clock in the evening , and went to bed at once , she was so tired . 
Her husband beat her . 
She is dead . 
We have not been very happy . 
She was a good girl , who did not go to the ball , and who was very peaceable . 
I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock . 
There , I am telling the truth ; you have only to ask .
