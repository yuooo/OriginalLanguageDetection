Mobs , as the reader knows , are like a snowball , and collect as they roll along , a throng of tumultuous men . 
These men do not ask each other whence they come . 
Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by Enjolras , Combeferre , and Courfeyrac , there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter , which was very threadbare on the shoulders , who gesticulated and vociferated , and who had the look of a drunken savage . 
This man , whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc , and who was , moreover , an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him , was very drunk , or assumed the appearance of being so , and had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine-shop . 
This Cabuc , while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade , whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the Rue Saint-Denis . 
All at once he exclaimed : -- `` Do you know , comrades , it is from that house yonder that we must fire . 
When we are at the windows , the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street ! '' 
`` Yes , but the house is closed , '' said one of the drinkers . 
`` Let us knock ! '' 
`` They will not open . ''
