A gendarme was seated near the door , on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D -- the proclamation of the Gulf Juan . 
The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme . 
The gendarme , without replying to his salute , stared attentively at him , followed him for a while with his eyes , and then entered the town-hall . 
There then existed at D -- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas . 
This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre , a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre , who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble , and had served in the Guides . 
At the time of the Emperor 's landing , many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins . 
It was said that General Bertrand , disguised as a carter , had made frequent trips thither in the month of January , and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens . 
The truth is , that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture ; he had thanked the mayor , saying , `` I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance '' ; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins . 
This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas , at a distance of five and twenty leagues . 
It was said of him in the town , `` That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble . ''
