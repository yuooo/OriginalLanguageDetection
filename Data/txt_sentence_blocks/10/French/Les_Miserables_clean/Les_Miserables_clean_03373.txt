No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation . 
And moreover , who could have guessed such a thing ? 
There are marshes of this description in India . 
The water seems extraordinary , inexplicable , rippling though there is no wind , and agitated where it should be calm . 
One gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions ; one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom . 
Many men have a secret monster in this same manner , a dragon which gnaws them , a despair which inhabits their night . 
Such a man resembles other men , he goes and comes . 
No one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth , which lives within the unhappy man , and of which he is dying . 
No one knows that this man is a gulf . 
He is stagnant but deep .
