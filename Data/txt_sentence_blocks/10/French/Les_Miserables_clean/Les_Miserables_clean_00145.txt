On the white margin he wrote a line or two , folded it without sealing , and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey . 
The landlord whispered a word in the scullion 's ear , and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall . 
The traveller saw nothing of all this . 
Once more he inquired , `` Will dinner be ready soon ? '' 
`` Immediately , '' responded the host . 
The child returned . 
He brought back the paper . 
The host unfolded it eagerly , like a person who is expecting a reply . 
He seemed to read it attentively , then tossed his head , and remained thoughtful for a moment . 
Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller , who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene .
