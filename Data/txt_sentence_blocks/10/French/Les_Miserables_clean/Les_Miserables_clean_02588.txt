Some queer star turns up , underlined by an enormous tail . 
And that causes the death of Caesar . 
Brutus deals him a blow with a knife , and God a blow with a comet . 
Crac , and behold an aurora borealis , behold a revolution , behold a great man ; '93 in big letters , Napoleon on guard , the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster . 
Ah ! 
what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes ! 
Boum ! 
Boum ! 
extraordinary show ! 
Raise your eyes , boobies .
