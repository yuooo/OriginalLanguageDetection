`` That 's enough , my jewel . '' 
At this word from his wife , Jondrette closed the door again , and this time , Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel , and descend the staircase rapidly . 
At that moment , one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard . 
SOLUS CUM SOLO , IN LOCO REMOTO , NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER Marius , dreamer as he was , was , as we have said , firm and energetic by nature . 
His habits of solitary meditation , while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion , had , perhaps , diminished the faculty for irritation , but had left intact the power of waxing indignant ; he had the kindliness of a brahmin , and the severity of a judge ; he took pity upon a toad , but he crushed a viper . 
Now , it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed , it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes . 
`` These wretches must be stamped upon , '' said he . 
Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated ; on the contrary , all of them had been rendered more dense , if anything ; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc , except that Jondrette was acquainted with them . 
Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered , the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation , a dark but terrible trap ; that both of them were incurring great danger , she probably , her father certainly ; that they must be saved ; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted , and the web of these spiders broken . 
He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment .
