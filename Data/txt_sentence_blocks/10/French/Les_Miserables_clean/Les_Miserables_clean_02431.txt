`` If we go away , do you go too ! 
I will tell you where ! 
Come and join me wherever I am . '' 
Marius was now a thoroughly roused man . 
He had fallen back into reality . 
He cried to Cosette : -- `` Go away with you ! 
Are you mad ?

Go to England ? 
But I am in debt now , I owe , I do n't know how much , more than ten louis to Courfeyrac , one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted !
