The Restoration had placed him on half-pay , then had sent him into residence , that is to say , under surveillance , at Vernon . 
King Louis XVIII. , regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all , did not recognize his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor , nor his grade of colonel , nor his title of baron . 
He , on his side , neglected no occasion of signing himself `` Colonel Baron Pontmercy . '' 
He had only an old blue coat , and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor . 
The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for `` illegal '' wearing of this decoration . 
When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary , Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile : `` I do not know whether I no longer understand French , or whether you no longer speak it ; but the fact is that I do not understand . '' 
Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette . 
They dared not interfere with him . 
Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address : A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy . '' 
He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken .
