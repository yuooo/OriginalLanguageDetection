One felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible . 
Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out , a serious sign of preoccupation , and had again seated himself . 
The candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance . 
He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand , as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue . 
In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself , he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him , took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there , and tried the edge of its blade on his nail . 
That done , he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it . 
Marius , on his side , grasped the pistol in his right pocket , drew it out and cocked it . 
The pistol emitted a sharp , clear click , as he cocked it . 
Jondrette started , half rose , listened a moment , then began to laugh and said : -- `` What a fool I am ! 
It 's the partition cracking ! ''
