`` Be quiet , '' said Cosette . 
`` Fasten everything thoroughly . '' 
Cosette , terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint , and possibly , also , by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week , which recurred to her memory , dared not even say to her : `` Go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench ! '' 
for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing `` the men '' to enter . 
She saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened , made Toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar , locked herself up in her own chamber , bolted her door , looked under her couch , went to bed and slept badly . 
All night long she saw that big stone , as large as a mountain and full of caverns . 
At sunrise , -- the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night , and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have caused , -- at sunrise Cosette , when she woke , viewed her fright as a nightmare , and said to herself : `` What have I been thinking of ? 
It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a week or two ago in the garden at night ! 
It is like the shadow of the chimney-pot ! 
Am I becoming a coward ? ''
