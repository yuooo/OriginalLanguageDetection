`` The railing is old , '' interpolated a fifth , who had the voice of a ventriloquist . 
`` So much the better , '' said the second who had spoken . 
`` It wo n't screech under the saw , and it wo n't be hard to cut . '' 
The sixth , who had not yet opened his lips , now began to inspect the gate , as Eponine had done an hour earlier , grasping each bar in succession , and shaking them cautiously . 
Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened . 
As he was on the point of grasping this bar , a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness , fell upon his arm ; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast , and a hoarse voice said to him , but not loudly : -- `` There 's a dog . '' 
At the same moment , he perceived a pale girl standing before him . 
The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings . 
He bristled up in hideous wise ; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy ; their terrified air evokes terror . 
He recoiled and stammered : -- `` What jade is this ? ''
