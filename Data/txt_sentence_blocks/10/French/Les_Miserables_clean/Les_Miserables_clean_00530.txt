Let us emphasize one detail . 
Never to have lied , never to have said , for any interest whatever , even in indifference , any single thing which was not the truth , the sacred truth , was Sister Simplice 's distinctive trait ; it was the accent of her virtue . 
She was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity . 
The Abbe Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu . 
However pure and sincere we may be , we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little , innocent lie . 
She did not . 
Little lie , innocent lie -- does such a thing exist ? 
To lie is the absolute form of evil . 
To lie a little is not possible : he who lies , lies the whole lie . 
To lie is the very face of the demon .
