Cosette raised her eyes ; she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun ; she heard the unprecedented words , `` It is for you '' ; she stared at him ; she stared at the doll ; then she slowly retreated , and hid herself at the extreme end , under the table in a corner of the wall . 
She no longer cried ; she no longer wept ; she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe . 
The Thenardier , Eponine , and Azelma were like statues also ; the very drinkers had paused ; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room . 
Madame Thenardier , petrified and mute , recommenced her conjectures : `` Who is that old fellow ? 
Is he a poor man ? 
Is he a millionaire ? 
Perhaps he is both ; that is to say , a thief . '' 
The face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force . 
The tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller ; he seemed to be scenting out the man , as he would have scented out a bag of money . 
This did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning .
