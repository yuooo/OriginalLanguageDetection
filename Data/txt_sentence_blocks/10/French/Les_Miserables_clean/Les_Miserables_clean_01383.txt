One of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is : `` I am fine and strong , come now ! ''

IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE LAST KING In summer , he metamorphoses himself into a frog ; and in the evening , when night is falling , in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena , from the tops of coal wagons , and the washerwomen 's boats , he hurls himself headlong into the Seine , and into all possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police . 
Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him , and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry ; that cry which was celebrated about 1830 , is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin ; it scans like a verse from Homer , with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the Panathenaea , and in it one encounters again the ancient Evohe .
