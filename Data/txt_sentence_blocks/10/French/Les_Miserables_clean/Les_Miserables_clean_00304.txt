An amour for him ; passion for her . 
The streets of the Latin quarter , filled with throngs of students and grisettes , saw the beginning of their dream . 
Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes of the hill of the Pantheon , where so many adventurers twine and untwine , but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again . 
There is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking . 
In short , the eclogue took place . 
Blachevelle , Listolier , and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which Tholomyes was the head . 
It was he who possessed the wit . 
Tholomyes was the antique old student ; he was rich ; he had an income of four thousand francs ; four thousand francs ! 
a splendid scandal on Mount Sainte-Genevieve . 
Tholomyes was a fast man of thirty , and badly preserved .
