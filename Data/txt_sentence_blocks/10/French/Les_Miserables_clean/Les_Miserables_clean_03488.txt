Jean Valjean turned to Cosette . 
He began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity . 
In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended , ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at Cosette . 
The reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage . 
The doctor felt of his pulse . 
`` Ah ! 
it was you that he wanted ! '' 
he murmured , looking at Cosette and Marius . 
And bending down to Marius ' ear , he added in a very low voice : `` Too late . '' 
Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely , almost without ceasing to gaze at Cosette .
