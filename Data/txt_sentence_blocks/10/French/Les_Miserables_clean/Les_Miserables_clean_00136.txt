and what is there left to desire beyond it ? 
A little garden in which to walk , and immensity in which to dream . 
At one 's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked ; over head that which one can study and meditate upon : some flowers on earth , and all the stars in the sky . 
WHAT HE THOUGHT One last word . 
Since this sort of details might , particularly at the present moment , and to use an expression now in fashion , give to the Bishop of D -- a certain `` pantheistical '' physiognomy , and induce the belief , either to his credit or discredit , that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century , which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits , and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion , we insist upon it , that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort . 
That which enlightened this man was his heart . 
His wisdom was made of the light which comes from there . 
No systems ; many works . 
Abstruse speculations contain vertigo ; no , there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses . 
The apostle may be daring , but the bishop must be timid .
