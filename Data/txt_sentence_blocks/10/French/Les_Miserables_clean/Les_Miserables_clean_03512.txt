This , sir , is what your letter prompts me to say ; I say it for you and for your country . 
If I have insisted so strongly , it is because of one phrase in your letter . 
You write : -- `` There are Italians , and they are numerous , who say : ` This book , Les Miserables , is a French book . 
It does not concern us . 
Let the French read it as a history , we read it as a romance . ' '' 
-- Alas ! 
I repeat , whether we be Italians or Frenchmen , misery concerns us all . 
Ever since history has been written , ever since philosophy has meditated , misery has been the garment of the human race ; the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag , and for replacing , upon the naked limbs of the Man-People , the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn . 
If this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and in dissipating some prejudices , you are at liberty to publish it , sir . 
Accept , I pray you , a renewed assurance of my very distinguished sentiments .
