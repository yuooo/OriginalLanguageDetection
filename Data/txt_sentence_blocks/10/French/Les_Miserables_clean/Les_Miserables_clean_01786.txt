Then , turning to M. Leblanc , and continuing his lamentations : -- `` You see , sir ! 
All the clothing that I have is my wife 's chemise ! 
And all torn at that ! 
In the depths of winter ! 
I ca n't go out for lack of a coat . 
If I had a coat of any sort , I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars , who knows me and is very fond of me . 
Does she not still reside in the Rue de la Tour-des-Dames ? 
Do you know , sir ? 
We played together in the provinces . 
I shared her laurels .
