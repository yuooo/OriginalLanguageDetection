The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon ; there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket . 
The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain , traversed Fauchelevent 's pupils . 
An idea had just occurred to him . 
He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind , without the grave-digger , who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth , observing it , and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it . 
The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave . 
Just as he turned round to get the fifth , Fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said : -- `` By the way , you new man , have you your card ? '' 
The grave-digger paused .
