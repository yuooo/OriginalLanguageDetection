This struck him as strange ; usually , there was no noise in M. Madeleine 's chamber until he rose in the morning . 
A moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened , and then shut again ; then a piece of furniture was disarranged ; then a pause ensued ; then the step began again . 
The cashier sat up in bed , quite awake now , and staring ; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall ; from the direction of the rays , it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine 's chamber . 
The reflection wavered , as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle . 
The shadow of the window-frame was not shown , which indicated that the window was wide open . 
The fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising . 
The cashier fell asleep again . 
An hour or two later he waked again . 
The same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead . 
The reflection was still visible on the wall , but now it was pale and peaceful , like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle .
