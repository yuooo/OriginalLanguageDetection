`` Very well , '' said Marius , `` then I will go elsewhere . '' 
Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words . 
She turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom . 
She stammered : -- `` What do you mean ? '' 
Marius looked at her , then raised his eyes to heaven , and answered : `` Nothing . '' 
When his eyes fell again , he saw Cosette smiling at him . 
The smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance , even at night . 
`` How silly we are ! 
Marius , I have an idea . '' 
`` What is it ? ''
