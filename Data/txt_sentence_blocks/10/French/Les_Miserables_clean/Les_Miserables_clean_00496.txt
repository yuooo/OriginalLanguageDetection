Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins . 
The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity ; the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion . 
But in a few days Fantine disarmed them . 
She said all kinds of humble and gentle things , and the mother in her provoked tenderness . 
One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever : `` I have been a sinner ; but when I have my child beside me , it will be a sign that God has pardoned me . 
While I was leading a bad life , I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me ; I could not have borne her sad , astonished eyes . 
It was for her sake that I did evil , and that is why God pardons me . 
I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here . 
I shall gaze at her ; it will do me good to see that innocent creature . 
She knows nothing at all .
