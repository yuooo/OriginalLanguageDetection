That could not hurt you . 
No , it is not so ? 
You see , you are my angel ! 
Let me come sometimes ; I think that I am going to die . 
If you only knew ! 
I adore you . 
Forgive me , I speak to you , but I do not know what I am saying ; I may have displeased you ; have I displeased you ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
my mother ! '' 
said she .
