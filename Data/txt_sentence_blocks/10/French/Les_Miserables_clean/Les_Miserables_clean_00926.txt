He had not the air of owning a sou , but he does not consider money ; he pays to Lagny , and he goes only as far as Chelles . 
It is night ; all the houses are shut ; he does not enter the inn , and he is not to be found . 
So he has dived through the earth . '' 
The man had not plunged into the earth , but he had gone with great strides through the dark , down the principal street of Chelles , then he had turned to the right before reaching the church , into the cross-road leading to Montfermeil , like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before . 
He followed this road rapidly . 
At the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny , he heard people coming . 
He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch , and there waited until the passers-by were at a distance . 
The precaution was nearly superfluous , however ; for , as we have already said , it was a very dark December night . 
Not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky .
