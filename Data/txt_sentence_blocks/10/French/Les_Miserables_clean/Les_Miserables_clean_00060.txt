Stolen they had already been elsewhere . 
Half of the adventure was completed ; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft , and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor . 
However , we make no assertions on this point . 
Only , a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop 's papers , which may bear some relation to this matter , and which is couched in these terms , `` The question is , to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital . '' 
PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING The senator above mentioned was a clever man , who had made his own way , heedless of those things which present obstacles , and which are called conscience , sworn faith , justice , duty : he had marched straight to his goal , without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest . 
He was an old attorney , softened by success ; not a bad man by any means , who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons , his sons-in-law , his relations , and even to his friends , having wisely seized upon , in life , good sides , good opportunities , good windfalls . 
Everything else seemed to him very stupid . 
He was intelligent , and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus ; while he was , in reality , only a product of Pigault-Lebrun . 
He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things , and at the `` Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop . '' 
He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself , who listened to him .
