This orchard is sentient , like others , in the month of May . 
It has its buttercups and its daisies ; the grass is tall there ; the cart-horses browse there ; cords of hair , on which linen is drying , traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head ; one walks over this uncultivated land , and one 's foot dives into mole-holes . 
In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies there all verdant . 
Major Blackmann leaned against it to die . 
Beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the German general , Duplat , descended from a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . 
An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over to one side , its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam . 
Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age . 
There is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan . 
-LSB- 6 -RSB- The skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard . 
Crows fly through their branches , and at the end of it is a wood full of violets .
