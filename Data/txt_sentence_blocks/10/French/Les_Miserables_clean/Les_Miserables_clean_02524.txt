In the Rue du Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas , an officer of the National Guard , on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils , took refuge with difficulty in a house , whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise . 
In the Quartier Saint-Jacques , the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Cafe du Progress , or descended to the Cafe des Sept-Billards , in the Rue des Mathurins . 
There , in front of the door , young men mounted on the stone corner-posts , distributed arms . 
They plundered the timber-yard in the Rue Transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades . 
On a single point the inhabitants resisted , at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye and the Rue Simon-Le-Franc , where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands . 
At a single point the insurgents yielded ; they abandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired on a detachment of the National Guard , and fled through the Rue de la Corderie . 
The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag , a package of cartridges , and three hundred pistol-balls . 
The National Guardsmen tore up the flag , and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets . 
All that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult , like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder . 
In less than an hour , twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the Halles alone .
