While the Bishop was watching him , the old man spoke : `` Thank you , '' he said , `` I need nothing . '' 
And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child . 
The Bishop stepped forward . 
At the sound which he made in walking , the old man turned his head , and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life . 
`` This is the first time since I have been here , '' said he , `` that any one has entered here . 
Who are you , sir ? '' 
The Bishop answered : -- `` My name is Bienvenu Myriel . '' 
`` Bienvenu Myriel ? 
I have heard that name . 
Are you the man whom the people call Monseigneur Welcome ? ''
