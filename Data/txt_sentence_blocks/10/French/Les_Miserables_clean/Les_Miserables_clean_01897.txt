I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it ! 
Well , never mind ! 
Say , now ! 
You must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the Lark ! 
You had your cudgel in the forest . 
You were the stronger . 
Revenge . 
I 'm the one to hold the trumps to-day ! 
You 're in a sorry case , my good fellow ! 
Oh , but I can laugh !
