They fed her on what all the rest had left -- a little better than the dog , a little worse than the cat . 
Moreover , the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions ; Cosette ate with them under the table , from a wooden bowl similar to theirs . 
The mother , who had established herself , as we shall see later on , at M. sur M. , wrote , or , more correctly , caused to be written , a letter every month , that she might have news of her child . 
The Thenardiers replied invariably , `` Cosette is doing wonderfully well . '' 
At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month , and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month . 
The year was not completed when Thenardier said : `` A fine favor she is doing us , in sooth ! 
What does she expect us to do with her seven francs ? '' 
and he wrote to demand twelve francs . 
The mother , whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy , `` and was coming on well , '' submitted , and forwarded the twelve francs . 
Certain natures can not love on the one hand without hating on the other .
