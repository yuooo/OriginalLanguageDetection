Let us continue . 
But these men , or these women who are behind these four walls . 
They dress themselves in coarse woollen , they are equals , they call each other brothers , that is well ; but they do something else ? 
Yes . 
What ? 
They gaze on the darkness , they kneel , and they clasp their hands . 
What does this signify ? 
PRAYER They pray . 
To whom ? 
To God .
