The doctor took Sister Simplice aside , and she explained matters to him ; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two , and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid , who believed that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil ; that it was possible , after all , that her guess was correct : the doctor approved . 
He returned to Fantine 's bed , and she went on : -- `` You see , when she wakes up in the morning , I shall be able to say good morning to her , poor kitten , and when I can not sleep at night , I can hear her asleep ; her little gentle breathing will do me good . '' 
`` Give me your hand , '' said the doctor . 
She stretched out her arm , and exclaimed with a laugh : -- `` Ah , hold ! 
in truth , you did not know it ; I am cured ; Cosette will arrive to-morrow . '' 
The doctor was surprised ; she was better ; the pressure on her chest had decreased ; her pulse had regained its strength ; a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor , worn-out creature . 
`` Doctor , '' she went on , `` did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has gone to get that mite of a child ? '' 
The doctor recommended silence , and that all painful emotions should be avoided ; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona , and , in case the fever should increase again during the night , a calming potion . 
As he took his departure , he said to the sister : -- `` She is doing better ; if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to-morrow with the child , who knows ?
