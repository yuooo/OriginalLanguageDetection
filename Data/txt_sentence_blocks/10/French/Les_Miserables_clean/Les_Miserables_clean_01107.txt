`` Well , then , this is the Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
Memories recurred to Jean Valjean . 
Chance , that is to say , Providence , had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old Fauchelevent , crippled by the fall from his cart , had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously . 
He repeated , as though talking to himself : -- `` The Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
`` Exactly , '' returned old Fauchelevent . 
`` But to come to the point , how the deuce did you manage to get in here , you , Father Madeleine ? 
No matter if you are a saint ; you are a man as well , and no man enters here . '' 
`` You certainly are here . '' 
`` There is no one but me . '' 
`` Still , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I must stay here . ''
