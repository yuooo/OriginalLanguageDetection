He had everything . 
He was complete . 
He had in his brain the sum of human faculties . 
He made codes like Justinian , he dictated like Caesar , his conversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal , with the thunderclap of Tacitus , he made history and he wrote it , his bulletins are Iliads , he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of Mahomet , he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids , at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty , at the Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace , in the Council of State be held his own against Merlin , he gave a soul to the geometry of the first , and to the chicanery of the last , he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers ; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles , he went to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel ; he saw everything ; he knew everything ; which did not prevent him from laughing good-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child ; and all at once , frightened Europe lent an ear , armies put themselves in motion , parks of artillery rumbled , pontoons stretched over the rivers , clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm , cries , trumpets , a trembling of thrones in every direction , the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map , the sound of a superhuman sword was heard , as it was drawn from its sheath ; they beheld him , him , rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand , and a glow in his eyes , unfolding amid the thunder , his two wings , the grand army and the old guard , and he was the archangel of war ! '' 
All held their peace , and Enjolras bowed his head . 
Silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence , of the enemy being driven to the wall . 
Marius continued with increased enthusiasm , and almost without pausing for breath : -- `` Let us be just , my friends ! 
What a splendid destiny for a nation to be the Empire of such an Emperor , when that nation is France and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man ! 
To appear and to reign , to march and to triumph , to have for halting-places all capitals , to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them , to decree the falls of dynasties , and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge ; to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God ; to follow in a single man , Hannibal , Caesar , Charlemagne ; to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in the morning , to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever , Marengo , Arcola , Austerlitz , Jena , Wagram ! 
To cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries , to make the French Empire a pendant to the Roman Empire , to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army , to make its legions fly forth over all the earth , as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer , to dominate , to strike with lightning , to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory , to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans , to conquer the world twice , by conquest and by dazzling , that is sublime ; and what greater thing is there ?
