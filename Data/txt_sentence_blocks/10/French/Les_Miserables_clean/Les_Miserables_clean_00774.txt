This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand . 
The right wing , as Charras says , was thrown back on the centre . 
An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the `` Museum of Waterloo . '' 
Besides this , Wellington had , behind a rise in the ground , Somerset 's Dragoon Guards , fourteen hundred horse strong . 
It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English cavalry . 
Ponsonby destroyed , Somerset remained . 
The battery , which , if completed , would have been almost a redoubt , was ranged behind a very low garden wall , backed up with a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth . 
This work was not finished ; there had been no time to make a palisade for it . 
Wellington , uneasy but impassive , was on horseback , and there remained the whole day in the same attitude , a little in advance of the old mill of Mont-Saint-Jean , which is still in existence , beneath an elm , which an Englishman , an enthusiastic vandal , purchased later on for two hundred francs , cut down , and carried off . 
Wellington was coldly heroic .
