Why ? 
Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction . 
Yesterday it was appetite , to-day it is plenitude , to-morrow it will be satiety . 
The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after Charles X . 
The attempt has been made , and wrongly , to make a class of the bourgeoisie . 
The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people . 
The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down . 
A chair is not a caste . 
But through a desire to sit down too soon , one may arrest the very march of the human race . 
This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie .
