This letter , coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius ' thoughts ever since the preceding evening , was like a candle in a cellar . 
All was suddenly illuminated . 
This letter came from the same place as the other four . 
There was the same writing , the same style , the same orthography , the same paper , the same odor of tobacco . 
There were five missives , five histories , five signatures , and a single signer . 
The Spanish Captain Don Alvares , the unhappy Mistress Balizard , the dramatic poet Genflot , the old comedian Fabantou , were all four named Jondrette , if , indeed , Jondrette himself were named Jondrette . 
Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time , and he had had , as we have said , but very rare occasion to see , to even catch a glimpse of , his extremely mean neighbors . 
His mind was elsewhere , and where the mind is , there the eyes are also . 
He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs ; but they were mere forms to him ; he had paid so little heed to them , that , on the preceding evening , he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard , without recognizing them , for it had evidently been they , and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him , in spite of disgust and pity , a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere . 
Now he saw everything clearly .
