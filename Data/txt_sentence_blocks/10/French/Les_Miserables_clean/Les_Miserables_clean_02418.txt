She fastened her intent gaze upon Thenardier and said : -- `` Not even of you , father ! '' 
Then she continued , as she cast her blood-shot , spectre-like eyes upon the ruffians in turn : -- `` What do I care if I 'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of the Rue Plumet , killed by the blows of my father 's club , or whether I 'm found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs ? '' 
She was forced to pause ; she was seized by a dry cough , her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle . 
She resumed : -- `` I have only to cry out , and people will come , and then slap , bang ! 
There are six of you ; I represent the whole world . '' 
Thenardier made a movement towards her . 
`` Do n't approach ! '' 
she cried . 
He halted , and said gently : -- `` Well , no ; I wo n't approach , but do n't speak so loud . 
So you intend to hinder us in our work , my daughter ?
