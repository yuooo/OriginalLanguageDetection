Cosette adored the goodman . 
She was always at his heels . 
Where Jean Valjean was , there happiness was . 
Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden ; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard , than in the enclosure filled with flowers , and in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry , against which stood tufted easy-chairs . 
Jean Valjean sometimes said to her , smiling at his happiness in being importuned : `` Do go to your own quarters ! 
Leave me alone a little ! '' 
She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father . 
`` Father , I am very cold in your rooms ; why do n't you have a carpet here and a stove ? '' 
`` Dear child , there are so many people who are better than I and who have not even a roof over their heads . '' 
`` Then why is there a fire in my rooms , and everything that is needed ? ''
