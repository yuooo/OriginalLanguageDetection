Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic spirit . 
Mingled with good sense , it sometimes adds force to the latter , as alcohol does to wine . 
Sometimes it is a defect . 
Homer repeats himself eternally , granted ; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin . 
Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs . 
Championnet , who treated miracles brutally , rose from the pavements of Paris ; he had , when a small lad , inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais , and of Saint-Etienne du Mont ; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius . 
The gamin of Paris is respectful , ironical , and insolent . 
He has villainous teeth , because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers , and handsome eyes because he has wit . 
If Jehovah himself were present , he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot . 
He is strong on boxing .
