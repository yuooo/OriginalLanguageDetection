In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs , -- one for the doctor , the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two long illnesses . 
Cosette , as we have already said , had not been ill . 
It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names . 
At the foot of the memorandum Thenardier wrote , Received on account , three hundred francs . 
M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more , and wrote , `` Make haste to bring Cosette . '' 
`` Christi ! '' 
said Thenardier , `` let 's not give up the child . '' 
In the meantime , Fantine did not recover . 
She still remained in the infirmary . 
The sisters had at first only received and nursed `` that woman '' with repugnance .
