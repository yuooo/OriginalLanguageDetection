For whom was this cabriolet ? 
Why was it driving at a walk ? 
Laigle took a survey . 
In it , beside the coachman , sat a young man , and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag . 
The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff : MARIUS PONTMERCY . 
This name caused Laigle to change his attitude . 
He drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet : -- `` Monsieur Marius Pontmercy ! '' 
The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt . 
The young man , who also seemed deeply buried in thought , raised his eyes : -- `` Hey ? '' 
said he .
