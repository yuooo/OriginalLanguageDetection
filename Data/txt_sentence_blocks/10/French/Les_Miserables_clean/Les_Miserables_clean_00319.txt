It is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years ; and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution . 
It is not dangerous . 
In short , it is an amiable rabble . '' 
Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion ; that does happen , however , and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris . 
Moreover , the cat so despised by Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old . 
In their eyes it was liberty incarnate ; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus , there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat . 
The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too `` rose-colored '' a light ; it is not so much of `` an amiable rabble '' as it is thought . 
The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek : no one sleeps more soundly than he , no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he , no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness ; let him not be trusted nevertheless ; he is ready for any sort of cool deed ; but when there is glory at the end of it , he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury . 
Give him a pike , he will produce the 10th of August ; give him a gun , you will have Austerlitz . 
He is Napoleon 's stay and Danton 's resource .
