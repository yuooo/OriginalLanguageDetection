Whenever she asked Jean Valjean , Jean Valjean remained silent . 
If she repeated her question , he responded with a smile . 
Once she insisted ; the smile ended in a tear .

Was it prudence ? 
Was it respect ? 
Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own ? 
So long as Cosette had been small , Jean Valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother ; when she became a young girl , it was impossible for him to do so . 
It seemed to him that he no longer dared . 
Was it because of Cosette ?
