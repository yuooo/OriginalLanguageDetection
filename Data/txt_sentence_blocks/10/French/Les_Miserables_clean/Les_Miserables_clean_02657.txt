Or a woman ? 
Were there many of them ? 
he could not have told . 
It had passed and vanished . 
Proceeding from circuit to circuit , he reached a lane which he judged to be the Rue de la Poterie ; near the middle of this street , he came in contact with an obstacle . 
He extended his hands . 
It was an overturned wagon ; his foot recognized pools of water , gullies , and paving-stones scattered and piled up . 
A barricade had been begun there and abandoned . 
He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier . 
He walked very near the street-posts , and guided himself along the walls of the houses .
