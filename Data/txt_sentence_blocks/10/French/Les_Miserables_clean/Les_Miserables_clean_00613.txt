If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn , it would have had no witnesses , no one would have heard him , things would have rested there , and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse ; but this conversation had taken place in the street . 
Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd . 
There are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators . 
While he was questioning the wheelwright , some people who were passing back and forth halted around them . 
After listening for a few minutes , a young lad , to whom no one had paid any heed , detached himself from the group and ran off . 
At the moment when the traveller , after the inward deliberation which we have just described , resolved to retrace his steps , this child returned . 
He was accompanied by an old woman . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the woman , `` my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet . '' 
These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs . 
He thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him , ready to seize him once more .
