He had just arrived there . 
On foot , evidently . 
No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour . 
He had walked all night . 
Whence came he ? 
Not from a very great distance ; for he had neither haversack , nor bundle . 
From Paris , no doubt . 
Why was he in these woods ? 
why was he there at such an hour ? 
what had he come there for ?
