He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked , hoping to find some side-street , to make his escape through it , and thus to break his scent once more . 
He arrived at a wall . 
This wall , however , did not absolutely prevent further progress ; it was a wall which bordered a transverse street , in which the one he had taken ended . 
Here again , he was obliged to come to a decision ; should he go to the right or to the left . 
He glanced to the right . 
The fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns , then ended at a blind alley . 
The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible , -- a lofty white wall . 
He glanced to the left . 
On that side the lane was open , and about two hundred paces further on , ran into a street of which it was the affluent . 
On that side lay safety .
