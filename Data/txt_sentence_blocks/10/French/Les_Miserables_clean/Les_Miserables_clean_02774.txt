This barricade was furious ; it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor ; at certain moments , when provoking the army , it was covered with throngs and tempest ; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it ; a swarm filled it ; it had a thorny crest of guns , of sabres , of cudgels , of axes , of pikes and of bayonets ; a vast red flag flapped in the wind ; shouts of command , songs of attack , the roll of drums , the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there . 
It was huge and living , and , like the back of an electric beast , there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning . 
The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of God ; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish . 
It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai . 
As we have said previously , it attacked in the name of the revolution -- what ? 
The revolution . 
It -- that barricade , chance , hazard , disorder , terror , misunderstanding , the unknown -- had facing it the Constituent Assembly , the sovereignty of the people , universal suffrage , the nation , the republic ; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise . 
Immense but heroic defiance , for the old faubourg is a hero . 
The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance . 
The faubourg shouldered the redoubt , the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg .
