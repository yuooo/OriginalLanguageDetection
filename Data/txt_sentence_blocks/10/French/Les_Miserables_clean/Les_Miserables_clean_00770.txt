FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON Towards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious . 
The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre , Hill of the right wing , Picton of the left wing . 
The Prince of Orange , desperate and intrepid , shouted to the Hollando-Belgians : `` Nassau ! 
Brunswick ! 
Never retreat ! '' 
Hill , having been weakened , had come up to the support of Wellington ; Picton was dead . 
At the very moment when the English had captured from the French the flag of the 105th of the line , the French had killed the English general , Picton , with a bullet through the head .
