Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed , and took possession of her , and , as she played , she put a hundred questions to Jean Valjean . 
Where was she ? 
Was Paris very large ? 
Was Madame Thenardier very far away ? 
Was she to go back ? 
etc. , etc. .

It was a frightful hole , but she felt free . 
`` Must I sweep ? '' 
she resumed at last .
