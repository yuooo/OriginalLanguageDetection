While he still went out , he had purchased of a coppersmith , for a few sous , a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed . 
That gibbet is always good to look at . 
A week passed , and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room . 
He still remained in bed . 
The portress said to her husband : -- `` The good man upstairs yonder does not get up , he no longer eats , he will not last long . 
That man has his sorrows , that he has . 
You wo n't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage . '' 
The porter replied , with the tone of marital sovereignty : `` If he 's rich , let him have a doctor . 
If he is not rich , let him go without . 
If he has no doctor he will die . ''
