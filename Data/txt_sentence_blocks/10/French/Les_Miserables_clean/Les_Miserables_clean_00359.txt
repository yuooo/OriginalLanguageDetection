exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine . 
And they burst out laughing . 
Fantine laughed with the rest . 
An hour later , when she had returned to her room , she wept . 
It was her first love affair , as we have said ; she had given herself to this Tholomyes as to a husband , and the poor girl had a child . 
ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER There was , at Montfermeil , near Paris , during the first quarter of this century , a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists . 
This cook-shop was kept by some people named Thenardier , husband and wife . 
It was situated in Boulanger Lane . 
Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall . 
Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back , the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general , with large silver stars ; red spots represented blood ; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke , and probably represented a battle .
