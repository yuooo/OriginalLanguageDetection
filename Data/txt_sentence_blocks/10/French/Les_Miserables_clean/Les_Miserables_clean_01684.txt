He followed `` Ursule . '' 
She lived in the Rue de l'Ouest , in the most unfrequented spot , in a new , three-story house , of modest appearance . 
From that moment forth , Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home . 
His hunger was increasing . 
He knew her first name , at least , a charming name , a genuine woman 's name ; he knew where she lived ; he wanted to know who she was . 
One evening , after he had followed them to their dwelling , and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate , he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter : -- `` Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor , who has just come in ? '' 
`` No , '' replied the porter . 
`` He is the gentleman on the third floor . '' 
Another step gained . 
This success emboldened Marius .
