To borrow vulgar phrases , which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express , Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant , and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady . 
Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap , a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck , the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house , a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff , with large , short sleeves , an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks , knotted round the waist with a green ribbon , with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners , coarse shoes on her feet , and yellow stockings , like the women of Marseilles . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine 's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806 , with a short waist , a narrow , sheath-like skirt , puffed sleeves , with flaps and buttons . 
She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig . 
Madame Magloire had an intelligent , vivacious , and kindly air ; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised , and her upper lip , which was larger than the lower , imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look . 
So long as Monseigneur held his peace , she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom ; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak , as we have seen , she obeyed passively like her mistress . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak . 
She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him . 
She had never been pretty , even when she was young ; she had large , blue , prominent eyes , and a long arched nose ; but her whole visage , her whole person , breathed forth an ineffable goodness , as we stated in the beginning . 
She had always been predestined to gentleness ; but faith , charity , hope , those three virtues which mildly warm the soul , had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity .
