Then , as his memory cleared by degrees , the effect of waking , he recalled his aunt , the ten louis , and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius . 
This set him to laughing . 
`` Perhaps he is no longer in the coach , '' he thought , as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform . 
`` He may have stopped at Poissy ; he may have stopped at Triel ; if he did not get out at Meulan , he may have got out at Mantes , unless he got out at Rolleboise , or if he did not go on as far as Pacy , with the choice of turning to the left at Evreus , or to the right at Laroche-Guyon . 
Run after him , aunty . 
What the devil am I to write to that good old soul ? '' 
At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial , made its appearance at the window of the coupe . 
`` Can that be Marius ? '' 
said the lieutenant . 
It was Marius .
