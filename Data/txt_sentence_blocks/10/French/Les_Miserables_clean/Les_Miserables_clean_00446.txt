She said , `` When I get rich , I will have my Cosette with me ; '' and she laughed . 
Her cough did not leave her , and she had sweats on her back . 
One day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms : `` Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood . 
A miliary fever , they call it . 
Expensive drugs are required . 
This is ruining us , and we can no longer pay for them . 
If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out , the little one will be dead . '' 
She burst out laughing , and said to her old neighbor : `` Ah ! 
they are good ! 
Forty francs !
