It is to this sentiment that I appeal at this decisive hour . 
If it still exists in you , -- and I hope it does , -- reflect before replying to me : consider on the one hand , this man , whom a word from you may ruin ; on the other hand , justice , which a word from you may enlighten . 
The instant is solemn ; there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken . 
Rise , prisoner . 
Brevet , take a good look at the accused , recall your souvenirs , and tell us on your soul and conscience , if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys , Jean Valjean ? '' 
Brevet looked at the prisoner , then turned towards the court . 
`` Yes , Mr. President , I was the first to recognize him , and I stick to it ; that man is Jean Valjean , who entered at Toulon in 1796 , and left in 1815 . 
I left a year later . 
He has the air of a brute now ; but it must be because age has brutalized him ; he was sly at the galleys : I recognize him positively . '' 
`` Take your seat , '' said the President .
