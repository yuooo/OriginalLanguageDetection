`` And what are you doing here ? '' 
resumed Jean Valjean . 
`` Why , I am covering my melons , of course ! '' 
In fact , at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him , old Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed . 
During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them . 
It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean . 
He continued : -- `` I said to myself , ` The moon is bright : it is going to freeze . 
What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats ? ' 
And , '' he added , looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile , -- `` pardieu ! 
you ought to have done the same !
