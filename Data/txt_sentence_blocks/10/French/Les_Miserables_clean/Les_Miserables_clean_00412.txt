Now , if the reader will admit , for a moment , with us , that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation , it will be easy for us to say what there was in Police Officer Javert . 
The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog , which is killed by the mother because , otherwise , as he grew up , he would devour the other little ones . 
Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face , and the result will be Javert . 
Javert had been born in prison , of a fortune-teller , whose husband was in the galleys . 
As he grew up , he thought that he was outside the pale of society , and he despaired of ever re-entering it . 
He observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men , -- those who attack it and those who guard it ; he had no choice except between these two classes ; at the same time , he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity , regularity , and probity , complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung . 
He entered the police ; he succeeded there . 
At forty years of age he was an inspector . 
During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the South . 
Before proceeding further , let us come to an understanding as to the words , `` human face , '' which we have just applied to Javert .
