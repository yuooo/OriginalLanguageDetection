He who says love , says woman . 
Ah ! 
ah ! 
behold omnipotence -- women . 
Ask that demagogue of a Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette . 
And of his own free will , too , the coward ! 
Woman ! 
There is no Robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns . 
I am no longer Royalist except towards that royalty . 
What is Adam ?
