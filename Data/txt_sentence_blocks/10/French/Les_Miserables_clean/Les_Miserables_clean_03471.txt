Where did you go ? 
Why have you stayed away so long ? 
Formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days . 
I sent Nicolette , the answer always was : ` He is absent . ' 
How long have you been back ? 
Why did you not let us know ? 
Do you know that you are very much changed ? 
Ah ! 
what a naughty father ! 
he has been ill , and we have not known it !
