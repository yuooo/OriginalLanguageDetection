The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him . 
Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive , and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling , in the direction of the corridor , in readiness to discharge his pistol . 
Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel , turned once more to M. Leblanc , and repeated his question , accompanying it with that low , repressed , and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him : -- `` So you do not recognize me ? '' 
M. Leblanc looked him full in the face , and replied : -- `` No . '' 
Then Jondrette advanced to the table . 
He leaned across the candle , crossing his arms , putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblanc 's calm face , and advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to retreat , and , in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite , he exclaimed : -- `` My name is not Fabantou , my name is not Jondrette , my name is Thenardier . 
I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil ! 
Do you understand ? 
Thenardier ! 
Now do you know me ? ''
