It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things : I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel . 
One day he heard a criminal case , which was in preparation and on the point of trial , discussed in a drawing-room . 
A wretched man , being at the end of his resources , had coined counterfeit money , out of love for a woman , and for the child which he had had by her . 
Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch . 
The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man . 
She was held , but there were no proofs except against her . 
She alone could accuse her lover , and destroy him by her confession . 
She denied ; they insisted . 
She persisted in her denial . 
Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown .
