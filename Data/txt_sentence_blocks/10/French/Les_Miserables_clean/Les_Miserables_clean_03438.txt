And , according to all appearances , if he were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation -- and without proof : `` Your wife is a bastard , '' the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer . 
From Thenardier 's point of view , the conversation with Marius had not yet begun . 
He ought to have drawn back , to have modified his strategy , to have abandoned his position , to have changed his front ; but nothing essential had been compromised as yet , and he had five hundred francs in his pocket . 
Moreover , he had something decisive to say , and , even against this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy , he felt himself strong . 
For men of Thenardier 's nature , every dialogue is a combat . 
In the one in which he was about to engage , what was his situation ? 
He did not know to whom he was speaking , but he did know of what he was speaking , he made this rapid review of his inner forces , and after having said : `` I am Thenardier , '' he waited . 
Marius had become thoughtful . 
So he had hold of Thenardier at last . 
That man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him .
