That man had taken himself off of his own accord , freely , willingly . 
This man was going to his death , and he , Jean Valjean , had had no hand in the matter , and it was through no fault of his . 
Perhaps , even , he is already dead . 
Here his fever entered into calculations . 
No , he is not dead yet . 
The letter had evidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning ; after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and midnight , nothing more has taken place ; the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak ; but that makes no difference , from the moment when `` that man '' is concerned in this war , he is lost ; he is caught in the gearing . 
Jean Valjean felt himself delivered . 
So he was about to find himself alone with Cosette once more . 
The rivalry would cease ; the future was beginning again . 
He had but to keep this note in his pocket .
