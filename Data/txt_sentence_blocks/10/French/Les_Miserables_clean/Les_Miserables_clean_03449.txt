I say skilfully , because , by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share , and , at the same stroke , to conceal one 's crime , and to enjoy one 's theft , to bury one 's name and to create for oneself a family . '' 
`` I might interrupt you at this point , '' said Marius , `` but go on . '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron , I will tell you all , leaving the recompense to your generosity . 
This secret is worth massive gold . 
You will say to me : ` Why do not you apply to Jean Valjean ? ' 
For a very simple reason ; I know that he has stripped himself , and stripped himself in your favor , and I consider the combination ingenious ; but he has no longer a son , he would show me his empty hands , and , since I am in need of some money for my trip to la Joya , I prefer you , you who have it all , to him who has nothing . 
I am a little fatigued , permit me to take a chair . '' 
Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same . 
Thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair , picked up his two newspapers , thrust them back into their envelope , and murmured as he pecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail : `` It cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one . '' 
That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair , an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying , then he entered upon his subject gravely , emphasizing his words : `` Monsieur le Baron , on the 6th of June , 1832 , about a year ago , on the day of the insurrection , a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris , at the point where the sewer enters the Seine , between the Pont des Invalides and the Pont de Jena .
