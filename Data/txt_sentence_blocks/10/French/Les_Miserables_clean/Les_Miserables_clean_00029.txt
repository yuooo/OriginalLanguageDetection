He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover , and succeeded , by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented , in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival , and that the man was deceiving her . 
Thereupon , exasperated by jealousy , she denounced her lover , confessed all , proved all . 
The man was ruined . 
He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice . 
They were relating the matter , and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate . 
By bringing jealousy into play , he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath , he had educed the justice of revenge . 
The Bishop listened to all this in silence . 
When they had finished , he inquired , -- `` Where are this man and woman to be tried ? '' 
`` At the Court of Assizes . '' 
He went on , `` And where will the advocate of the crown be tried ? ''
