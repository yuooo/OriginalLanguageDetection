Having exhausted these considerations , he passed on to Jean Valjean himself . 
Who was this Jean Valjean ? 
Description of Jean Valjean : a monster spewed forth , etc. . 
The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of Theramene , which is not useful to tragedy , but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence . 
The audience and the jury `` shuddered . '' 
The description finished , the district-attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day : And it is such a man , etc. , etc. , etc. , vagabond , beggar , without means of existence , etc. , etc. , inured by his past life to culpable deeds , and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys , as was proved by the crime committed against Little Gervais , etc. , etc. ; it is such a man , caught upon the highway in the very act of theft , a few paces from a wall that had been scaled , still holding in his hand the object stolen , who denies the crime , the theft , the climbing the wall ; denies everything ; denies even his own identity ! 
In addition to a hundred other proofs , to which we will not recur , four witnesses recognize him -- Javert , the upright inspector of police ; Javert , and three of his former companions in infamy , the convicts Brevet , Chenildieu , and Cochepaille . 
What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity ? 
His denial . 
What obduracy !
