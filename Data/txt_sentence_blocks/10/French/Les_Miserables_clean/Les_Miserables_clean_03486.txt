`` Even if you were to take possession of me , Monsieur Pontmercy , would that make me other than I am ? 
No , God has thought like you and myself , and he does not change his mind ; it is useful for me to go . 
Death is a good arrangement . 
God knows better than we what we need . 
May you be happy , may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette , may youth wed the morning , may there be around you , my children , lilacs and nightingales ; may your life be a beautiful , sunny lawn , may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls , and now let me , who am good for nothing , die ; it is certain that all this is right . 
Come , be reasonable , nothing is possible now , I am fully conscious that all is over . 
And then , last night , I drank that whole jug of water . 
How good thy husband is , Cosette ! 
Thou art much better off with him than with me . '' 
A noise became audible at the door .
