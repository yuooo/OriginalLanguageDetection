The reader knows the rest . 
Marius pursued his senseless course . 
One day he followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest . 
Another day he spoke to the porter . 
The porter , on his side , spoke , and said to Jean Valjean : `` Monsieur , who is that curious young man who is asking for you ? '' 
On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last perceived . 
A week later , Jean Valjean had taken his departure . 
He swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg or in the Rue de l'Ouest . 
He returned to the Rue Plumet . 
Cosette did not complain , she said nothing , she asked no questions , she did not seek to learn his reasons ; she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined , and of betraying herself .
