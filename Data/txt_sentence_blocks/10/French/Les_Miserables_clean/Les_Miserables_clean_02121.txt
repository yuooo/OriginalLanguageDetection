He gazed with terror on this beauty , which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him , beneath his very eyes , on the innocent and formidable brow of that child , from the depths of her homeliness , of his old age , of his misery , of his reprobation . 
He said to himself : `` How beautiful she is ! 
What is to become of me ? '' 
There , moreover , lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother . 
What he beheld with anguish , a mother would have gazed upon with joy . 
The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance . 
On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself : `` Decidedly I am beautiful ! '' 
Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet . 
She recalled the remark of that passer-by : `` Pretty , but badly dressed , '' the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished , after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined , later on , to fill the whole life of woman , coquetry . 
Love is the other .
