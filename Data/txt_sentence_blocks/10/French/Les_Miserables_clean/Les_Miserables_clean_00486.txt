Then M. Madeleine folded his arms , and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto : -- `` The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police . 
According to the terms of articles nine , eleven , fifteen , and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination , I am the judge . 
I order that this woman shall be set at liberty . '' 
Javert ventured to make a final effort . 
`` But , Mr. Mayor -- '' `` I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December , 1799 , in regard to arbitrary detention . '' 
`` Monsieur le Maire , permit me -- '' `` Not another word . '' 
`` But -- '' `` Leave the room , '' said M. Madeleine . 
Javert received the blow erect , full in the face , in his breast , like a Russian soldier . 
He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room . 
Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed .
