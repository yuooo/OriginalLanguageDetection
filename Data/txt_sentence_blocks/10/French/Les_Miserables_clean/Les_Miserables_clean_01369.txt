The gamin called her Mademoiselle Muche -- `` hide yourself . '' 
This being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights , has rags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher , fishes in the sewer , hunts in the cesspool , extracts mirth from foulness , whips up the squares with his wit , grins and bites , whistles and sings , shouts , and shrieks , tempers Alleluia with Matantur-lurette , chants every rhythm from the De Profundis to the Jack-pudding , finds without seeking , knows what he is ignorant of , is a Spartan to the point of thieving , is mad to wisdom , is lyrical to filth , would crouch down on Olympus , wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars . 
The gamin of Paris is Rabelais in this youth . 
He is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket . 
He is not easily astonished , he is still less easily terrified , he makes songs on superstitions , he takes the wind out of exaggerations , he twits mysteries , he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts , he takes the poetry out of stilted things , he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas . 
It is not that he is prosaic ; far from that ; but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria . 
If Adamastor were to appear to him , the street Arab would say : `` Hi there ! 
The bugaboo ! '' 
HE MAY BE OF USE Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab , two beings of which no other city is capable ; the passive acceptance , which contents itself with gazing , and the inexhaustible initiative ; Prudhomme and Fouillou . 
Paris alone has this in its natural history .
