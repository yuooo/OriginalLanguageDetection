He went to this table with a sort of vivacity , took a key from his pocket , and opened the valise . 
From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which , ten years before , Cosette had quitted Montfermeil ; first the little gown , then the black fichu , then the stout , coarse child 's shoes which Cosette might almost have worn still , so tiny were her feet , then the fustian bodice , which was very thick , then the knitted petticoat , next the apron with pockets , then the woollen stockings . 
These stockings , which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg , were no longer than Jean Valjean 's hand . 
All this was black of hue . 
It was he who had brought those garments to Montfermeil for her . 
As he removed them from the valise , he laid them on the bed . 
He fell to thinking . 
He called up memories . 
It was in winter , in a very cold month of December , she was shivering , half-naked , in rags , her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes . 
He , Jean Valjean , had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments .
