Dieu-Jesus ! 
Did you fall from heaven ? 
There is no trouble about that : if ever you do fall , it will be from there . 
And what a state you are in ! 
You have no cravat ; you have no hat ; you have no coat ! 
Do you know , you would have frightened any one who did not know you ? 
No coat ! 
Lord God ! 
Are the saints going mad nowadays ? 
But how did you get in here ? ''
