Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall . 
Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement , without uttering a word . 
Jean Valjean 's injunction , and the name of Madame Thenardier , had chilled her blood . 
All at once she heard Jean Valjean 's voice crying to her , though in a very low tone : -- `` Put your back against the wall . '' 
She obeyed . 
`` Do n't say a word , and do n't be alarmed , '' went on Jean Valjean . 
And she felt herself lifted from the ground . 
Before she had time to recover herself , she was on the top of the wall . 
Jean Valjean grasped her , put her on his back , took her two tiny hands in his large left hand , lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant . 
As he had guessed , there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground , with a gentle slope which grazed the linden-tree .
