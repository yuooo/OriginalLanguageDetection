After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour , and some erasures , Thenardier produced the following masterpiece : -- BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1 . 
Supper ... 3 francs . 
Chamber ... 10 '' Candle ... 5 '' Fire ... 4 '' Service ... 1 '' ---------- Total ... 23 francs . 
Service was written servisse . 
`` Twenty-three francs ! '' 
cried the woman , with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation . 
Like all great artists , Thenardier was dissatisfied . 
`` Peuh ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France 's bill at the Congress of Vienna .
