`` Are you going as far as Lagny ? '' 
demanded the coachman . 
`` Yes , '' said the man . 
The traveller paid to Lagny . 
They started . 
When they had passed the barrier , the coachman tried to enter into conversation , but the traveller only replied in monosyllables . 
The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses . 
The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak . 
It was cold . 
The man did not appear to be thinking of that .
