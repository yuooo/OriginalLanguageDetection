He thought that he had , and he really had , in fact , arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy , and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven , the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom of her well . 
This did not prevent him from multiplying his plans , his combinations , his scaffoldings , his projects for the future . 
In this state of revery , an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius ' interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul . 
In fact , had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others , we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams , than according to what he thinks . 
There is will in thought , there is none in dreams . 
Revery , which is utterly spontaneous , takes and keeps , even in the gigantic and the ideal , the form of our spirit . 
Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul , than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny . 
In these aspirations , much more than in deliberate , rational coordinated ideas , is the real character of a man to be found . 
Our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us . 
Each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature .
