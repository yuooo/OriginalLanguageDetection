He had never approached a cannon in his life , even at the Invalides . 
He had a passable stomach , a brother who was a cure , perfectly white hair , no teeth , either in his mouth or his mind , a trembling in every limb , a Picard accent , an infantile laugh , the air of an old sheep , and he was easily frightened . 
Add to this , that he had no other friendship , no other acquaintance among the living , than an old bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques , named Royal . 
His dream was to naturalize indigo in France . 
His servant was also a sort of innocent . 
The poor good old woman was a spinster . 
Sultan , her cat , which might have mewed Allegri 's miserere in the Sixtine Chapel , had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her . 
None of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man . 
She had never been able to get further than her cat . 
Like him , she had a mustache .
