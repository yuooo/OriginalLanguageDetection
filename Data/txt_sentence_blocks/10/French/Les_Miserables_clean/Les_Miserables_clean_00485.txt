`` Then content yourself with obeying . '' 
`` I am obeying my duty . 
My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison . '' 
M. Madeleine replied gently : -- `` Heed this well ; she will not serve a single day . '' 
At this decisive word , Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say , but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful : -- `` I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire ; it is for the first time in my life , but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my authority . 
I confine myself , since Monsieur le Maire desires it , to the question of the gentleman . 
I was present . 
This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabnois , who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony , which forms the corner of the esplanade , three stories high and entirely of cut stone . 
Such things as there are in the world ! 
In any case , Monsieur le Maire , this is a question of police regulations in the streets , and concerns me , and I shall detain this woman Fantine . ''
