In this manner she advanced a dozen paces , but the bucket was full ; it was heavy ; she was forced to set it on the ground once more . 
She took breath for an instant , then lifted the handle of the bucket again , and resumed her march , proceeding a little further this time , but again she was obliged to pause . 
After some seconds of repose she set out again . 
She walked bent forward , with drooping head , like an old woman ; the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms . 
The iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands ; she was forced to halt from time to time , and each time that she did so , the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs . 
This took place in the depths of a forest , at night , in winter , far from all human sight ; she was a child of eight : no one but God saw that sad thing at the moment . 
And her mother , no doubt , alas ! 
For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves . 
She panted with a sort of painful rattle ; sobs contracted her throat , but she dared not weep , so afraid was she of the Thenardier , even at a distance : it was her custom to imagine the Thenardier always present . 
However , she could not make much headway in that manner , and she went on very slowly .
