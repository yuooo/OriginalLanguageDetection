Still , how had it come to pass that , having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie , he had been picked up by the police-agent on the banks of the Seine , near the Pont des Invalides ? 
Some one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to the Champs-Elysees .

Unheard-of devotion ! 
Some one ? 
Who ? 
This was the man for whom Marius was searching . 
Of this man , who was his savior , nothing ; not a trace ; not the faintest indication . 
Marius , although forced to preserve great reserve , in that direction , pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police .
