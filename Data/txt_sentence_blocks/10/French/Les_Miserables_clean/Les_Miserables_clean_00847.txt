Bat-like creatures , half brigands and lackeys ; all the sorts of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders ; wearers of uniforms , who take no part in the fighting ; pretended invalids ; formidable limpers ; interloping sutlers , trotting along in little carts , sometimes accompanied by their wives , and stealing things which they sell again ; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers ; soldiers ' servants ; marauders ; armies on the march in days gone by , -- we are not speaking of the present , -- dragged all this behind them , so that in the special language they are called `` stragglers . '' 
No army , no nation , was responsible for those beings ; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans , then spoke French and followed the English . 
It was by one of these wretches , a Spanish straggler who spoke French , that the Marquis of Fervacques , deceived by his Picard jargon , and taking him for one of our own men , was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-field itself , in the course of the night which followed the victory of Cerisoles . 
The rascal sprang from this marauding . 
The detestable maxim , Live on the enemy !

Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage ; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness . 
Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood . 
The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number , according as the chief was more or less severe .
