All of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families . 
The outer boulevard is their breathing space ; the suburbs belong to them . 
There they are eternally playing truant . 
There they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs . 
There they are , or rather , there they exist , far from every eye , in the sweet light of May or June , kneeling round a hole in the ground , snapping marbles with their thumbs , quarrelling over half-farthings , irresponsible , volatile , free and happy ; and , no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry , and that they must earn their living , and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers , or a bunch of lilacs . 
These encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of Paris . 
Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys , -- are they their sisters ? 
-- who are almost young maidens , thin , feverish , with sunburnt hands , covered with freckles , crowned with poppies and ears of rye , gay , haggard , barefooted . 
They can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat . 
In the evening they can be heard laughing .
