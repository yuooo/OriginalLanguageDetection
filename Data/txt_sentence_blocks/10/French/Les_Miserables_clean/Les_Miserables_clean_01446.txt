Moreover , as it is indispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century , this feudal salon was , as we have said , dominated by a bourgeois . 
M. Gillenormand reigned there . 
There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society . 
There reputations , even Royalist reputations , were held in quarantine . 
There is always a trace of anarchy in renown . 
Chateaubriand , had he entered there , would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene . 
Some of the scoffed-at did , nevertheless , penetrate thither on sufferance . 
Comte Beug *** was received there , subject to correction . 
The `` noble '' salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons . 
The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now .
