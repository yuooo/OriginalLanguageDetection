He was superficial , rapid , easily angered . 
He flew into a passion at everything , generally quite contrary to all reason . 
When contradicted , he raised his cane ; he beat people as he had done in the great century . 
He had a daughter over fifty years of age , and unmarried , whom he chastised severely with his tongue , when in a rage , and whom he would have liked to whip . 
She seemed to him to be eight years old . 
He boxed his servants ' ears soundly , and said : `` Ah ! 
carogne ! '' 
One of his oaths was : `` By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade ! '' 
He had singular freaks of tranquillity ; he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him , being jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife , a pretty and coquettish barberess . 
M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things , and declared that he was extremely sagacious ; here is one of his sayings : `` I have , in truth , some penetration ; I am able to say when a flea bites me , from what woman it came . ''
