A leg of exquisite shape appeared . 
Marius saw it . 
He was exasperated and furious . 
The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress , with a divinely troubled motion , but he was none the less angry for all that . 
He was alone in the alley , it is true . 
But there might have been some one there . 
And what if there had been some one there ! 
Can any one comprehend such a thing ? 
What she had just done is horrible !
