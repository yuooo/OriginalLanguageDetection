This rascal of composite order was , in all probability , some Fleming from Lille , in Flanders , a Frenchman in Paris , a Belgian at Brussels , being comfortably astride of both frontiers . 
As for his prowess at Waterloo , the reader is already acquainted with that . 
It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle . 
Ebb and flow , wandering , adventure , was the leven of his existence ; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life , and , apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18 , 1815 , Thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken , beating about the country , selling to some , stealing from others , and travelling like a family man , with wife and children , in a rickety cart , in the rear of troops on the march , with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army . 
This campaign ended , and having , as he said , `` some quibus , '' he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there . 
This quibus , composed of purses and watches , of gold rings and silver crosses , gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses , did not amount to a large total , and did not carry this sutler turned eating-house-keeper very far . 
Thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which , accompanied by an oath , recalls the barracks , and by a sign of the cross , the seminary . 
He was a fine talker .

Nevertheless , the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly .
