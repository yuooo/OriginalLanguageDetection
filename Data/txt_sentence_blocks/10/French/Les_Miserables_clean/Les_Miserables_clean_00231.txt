At times , amid his convict toil , he paused . 
He fell to thinking . 
His reason , at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore , rose in revolt . 
Everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd ; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible . 
He said to himself , `` It is a dream . '' 
He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a few paces from him ; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him . 
All of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel . 
Visible nature hardly existed for him . 
It would almost be true to say that there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun , nor fine summer days , nor radiant sky , nor fresh April dawns . 
I know not what vent-hole daylight habitually illumined his soul .
