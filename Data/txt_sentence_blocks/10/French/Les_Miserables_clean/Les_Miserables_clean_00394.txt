This seemed all the more probable since the man was religious , and even practised his religion to a certain degree , a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch . 
He went regularly to low mass every Sunday . 
The local deputy , who nosed out all rivalry everywhere , soon began to grow uneasy over this religion . 
This deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire , and shared the religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire , known under the name of Fouche , Duc d'Otrante , whose creature and friend he had been . 
He indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors . 
But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock , he perceived in him a possible candidate , and resolved to outdo him ; he took a Jesuit confessor , and went to high mass and to vespers . 
Ambition was at that time , in the direct acceptation of the word , a race to the steeple . 
The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God , for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital , which made twelve . 
Nevertheless , in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that , on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country , Father Madeleine was to be appointed by the King , mayor of M. sur M. Those who had pronounced this new-comer to be `` an ambitious fellow , '' seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire , to exclaim , `` There ! 
what did we say ! ''
