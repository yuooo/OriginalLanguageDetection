How ? 
When ? 
No one knew , but it was certain and inevitable . 
In this place which had been marked out for the struggle , the Government and the insurrection , the National Guard , and popular societies , the bourgeois and the uprising , groping their way , were about to come into contact . 
The necessity was the same for both . 
The only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors . 
A situation so extreme , an obscurity so powerful , that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution , and the most daring with terror . 
Moreover , on both sides , the fury , the rage , and the determination were equal . 
For the one party , to advance meant death , and no one dreamed of retreating ; for the other , to remain meant death , and no one dreamed of flight . 
It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day , that triumph should rest either here or there , that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish .
