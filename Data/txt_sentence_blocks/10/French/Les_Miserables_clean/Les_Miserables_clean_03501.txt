In that lay my stupidity . 
Those Thenardiers were wicked . 
Thou must forgive them . 
Cosette , the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother . 
She was called Fantine . 
Remember that name -- Fantine . 
Kneel whenever thou utterest it . 
She suffered much . 
She loved thee dearly . 
She had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness .
