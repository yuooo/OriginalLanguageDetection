Nothing less than the first was required to soften the second . 
By one of those singular effects , which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies , in proportion as his revery continued , as the Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes , so did Jean Valjean grow less and vanish . 
After a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade . 
All at once he disappeared . 
The Bishop alone remained ; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance . 
Jean Valjean wept for a long time . 
He wept burning tears , he sobbed with more weakness than a woman , with more fright than a child . 
As he wept , daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul ; an extraordinary light ; a light at once ravishing and terrible . 
His past life , his first fault , his long expiation , his external brutishness , his internal hardness , his dismissal to liberty , rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance , what had happened to him at the Bishop 's , the last thing that he had done , that theft of forty sous from a child , a crime all the more cowardly , and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop 's pardon , -- all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him , but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed . 
He examined his life , and it seemed horrible to him ; his soul , and it seemed frightful to him .
