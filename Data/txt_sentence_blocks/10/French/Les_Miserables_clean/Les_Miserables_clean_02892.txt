`` What is that ? '' 
inquired the child . 
The father replied : `` It is the Saturnalia . '' 
All at once , he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green swan-hutch . 
`` There is the beginning , '' said he . 
And , after a pause , he added : `` Anarchy is entering this garden . '' 
In the meanwhile , his son took a bite of his brioche , spit it out , and , suddenly burst out crying . 
`` What are you crying about ? '' 
demanded his father . 
`` I am not hungry any more , '' said the child .
