His orientation had changed . 
What had been his East became the West . 
He had turned squarely round . 
All these revolutions were accomplished within him , without his family obtaining an inkling of the case . 
When , during this mysterious labor , he had entirely shed his old Bourbon and ultra skin , when he had cast off the aristocrat , the Jacobite and the Royalist , when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist , profoundly democratic and republican , he went to an engraver on the Quai des Orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name : Le Baron Marius Pontmercy . 
This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him , a change in which everything gravitated round his father . 
Only , as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter , he put them in his pocket . 
By another natural consequence , in proportion as he drew nearer to his father , to the latter 's memory , and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before , he receded from his grandfather . 
We have long ago said , that M. Gillenormand 's temper did not please him . 
There already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man .
