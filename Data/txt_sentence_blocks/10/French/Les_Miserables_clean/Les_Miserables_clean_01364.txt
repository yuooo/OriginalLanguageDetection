And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life : the first , when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him ; the second , at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him , and when the galleys were again yawning ; and that , had it not been for the first , he should have relapsed into crime , and had it not been for the second , into torment . 
His whole heart melted in gratitude , and he loved more and more . 
Many years passed in this manner ; Cosette was growing up .

`` Cosette '' -RSB- MARIUS . 
PARVULUS Paris has a child , and the forest has a bird ; the bird is called the sparrow ; the child is called the gamin .

Homuncio , Plautus would say . 
This little being is joyous . 
He has not food every day , and he goes to the play every evening , if he sees good .
