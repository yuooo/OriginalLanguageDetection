`` But the brigands , Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Hold , '' said the Bishop , `` I must think of that . 
You are right . 
I may meet them . 
They , too , need to be told of the good God . '' 
`` But , Monseigneur , there is a band of them ! 
A flock of wolves ! '' 
`` Monsieur le maire , it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd . 
Who knows the ways of Providence ? '' 
`` They will rob you , Monseigneur . ''
