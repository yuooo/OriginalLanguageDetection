She dared make herself no promises , and she did not wish to refuse herself anything . 
Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance , and shivers ran through her frame . 
It seemed to her , at intervals , that she was entering the land of chimaeras ; she said to herself : `` Is this reality ? '' 
Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown , she pressed it to her heart , she felt its angles against her flesh ; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment , he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy , which overflowed from beneath her eyelids . 
-- `` Oh yes ! '' 
she thought , `` it is certainly he ! 
This comes from him , and is for me ! '' 
And she told herself that an intervention of the angels , a celestial chance , had given him back to her . 
Oh transfiguration of love ! 
Oh dreams !
