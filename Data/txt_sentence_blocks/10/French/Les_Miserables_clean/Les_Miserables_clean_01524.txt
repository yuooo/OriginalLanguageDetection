It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting , he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle , and to attack it by main force and explosively ; but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually , by means of education , the inculcation of axioms , the promulgation of positive laws ; and , between two lights , his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration . 
A conflagration can create an aurora , no doubt , but why not await the dawn ? 
A volcano illuminates , but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination . 
Possibly , Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime . 
A light troubled by smoke , progress purchased at the expense of violence , only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit . 
The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth , a ' 93 , terrified him ; nevertheless , stagnation was still more repulsive to him , in it he detected putrefaction and death ; on the whole , he preferred scum to miasma , and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool , and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon . 
In short , he desired neither halt nor haste . 
While his tumultuous friends , captivated by the absolute , adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures , Combeferre was inclined to let progress , good progress , take its own course ; he may have been cold , but he was pure ; methodical , but irreproachable ; phlegmatic , but imperturbable . 
Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor , and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races . 
The good must be innocent , he repeated incessantly .
