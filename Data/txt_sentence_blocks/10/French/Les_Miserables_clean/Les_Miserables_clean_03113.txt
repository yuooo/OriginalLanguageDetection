He saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold . 
He felt himself emptied , useless , put out of joint with his past life , turned out , dissolved . 
Authority was dead within him . 
He had no longer any reason for existing . 
A terrible situation ! 
to be touched . 
To be granite and to doubt ! 
to be the statue of Chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law , and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one 's breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart ! 
To come to the pass of returning good for good , although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil ! 
to be the watch-dog , and to lick the intruder 's hand !
