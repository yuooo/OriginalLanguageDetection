To meet was to find each other . 
At the mysterious moment when their hands touched , they were welded together . 
When these two souls perceived each other , they recognized each other as necessary to each other , and embraced each other closely . 
Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense , we may say that , separated from every one by the walls of the tomb , Jean Valjean was the widower , and Cosette was the orphan : this situation caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette 's father after a celestial fashion . 
And in truth , the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion , but a reality . 
The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God . 
Moreover , Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well . 
There he seemed perfectly secure . 
The chamber with a dressing-room , which he occupied with Cosette , was the one whose window opened on the boulevard . 
This being the only window in the house , no neighbors ' glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side .
