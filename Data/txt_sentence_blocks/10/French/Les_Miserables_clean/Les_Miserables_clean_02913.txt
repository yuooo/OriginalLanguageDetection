Then he turned to Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a look which it required no words to interpret : `` Javert , it is I. '' Javert replied : `` Take your revenge . '' 
Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife , and opened it . 
`` A clasp-knife ! '' 
exclaimed Javert , `` you are right . 
That suits you better . '' 
Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck , then he cut the cords on his wrists , then , stooping down , he cut the cord on his feet ; and , straightening himself up , he said to him : `` You are free . '' 
Javert was not easily astonished . 
Still , master of himself though he was , he could not repress a start . 
He remained open-mouthed and motionless .
