You lodge me in your house , close to yourself like this ? '' 
He broke off , and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous : -- `` Have you really reflected well ? 
How do you know that I have not been an assassin ? '' 
The Bishop replied : -- `` That is the concern of the good God . '' 
Then gravely , and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself , he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man , who did not bow , and without turning his head or looking behind him , he returned to his bedroom . 
When the alcove was in use , a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar . 
The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer . 
A moment later he was in his garden , walking , meditating , conteplating , his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open . 
As for the man , he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets . 
Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts , he dropped , all dressed as he was , upon the bed , where he immediately fell into a profound sleep .
