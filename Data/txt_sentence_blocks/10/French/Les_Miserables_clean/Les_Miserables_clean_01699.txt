Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche ; Marat is an aristocrat to Schinderhannes . 
This cavern has for its object the destruction of everything . 
Of everything . 
Including the upper superior mines , which it execrates . 
It not only undermines , in its hideous swarming , the actual social order ; it undermines philosophy , it undermines human thought , it undermines civilization , it undermines revolution , it undermines progress . 
Its name is simply theft , prostitution , murder , assassination . 
It is darkness , and it desires chaos . 
Its vault is formed of ignorance . 
All the others , those above it , have but one object -- to suppress it . 
It is to this point that philosophy and progress tend , with all their organs simultaneously , by their amelioration of the real , as well as by their contemplation of the absolute .
