Madeleine made no reply . 
All the spectators were panting . 
The wheels had continued to sink , and it had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle . 
Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver , the cart rose slowly , the wheels half emerged from the ruts . 
They heard a stifled voice crying , `` Make haste ! 
Help ! '' 
It was Madeleine , who had just made a final effort . 
They rushed forwards . 
The devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all . 
The cart was raised by twenty arms .
