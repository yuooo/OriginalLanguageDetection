This was the antiquated elegance of his day . 
TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand 's two daughters . 
They had come into the world ten years apart . 
In their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other , either in character or countenance , and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible . 
The youngest had a charming soul , which turned towards all that belongs to the light , was occupied with flowers , with verses , with music , which fluttered away into glorious space , enthusiastic , ethereal , and was wedded from her very youth , in ideal , to a vague and heroic figure . 
The elder had also her chimera ; she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor , a contractor , a splendidly stupid husband , a million made man , or even a prefect ; the receptions of the Prefecture , an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck , official balls , the harangues of the town-hall , to be `` Madame la Prefete , '' -- all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination . 
Thus the two sisters strayed , each in her own dream , at the epoch when they were young girls . 
Both had wings , the one like an angel , the other like a goose . 
No ambition is ever fully realized , here below at least . 
No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day .
