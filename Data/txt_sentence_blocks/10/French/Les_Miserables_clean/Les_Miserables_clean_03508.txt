Have you not indigent persons ? 
Glance below . 
Have you not parasites ? 
Glance up . 
Does not that hideous balance , whose two scales , pauperism and parasitism , so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium , oscillate before you as it does before us ? 
Where is your army of schoolmasters , the only army which civilization acknowledges ? 
Where are your free and compulsory schools ? 
Does every one know how to read in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo ? 
Have you made public schools of your barracks ? 
Have you not , like ourselves , an opulent war-budget and a paltry budget of education ?
