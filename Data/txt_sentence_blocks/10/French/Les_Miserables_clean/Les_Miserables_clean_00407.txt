One overflows with serenity , with gayety , with ecstasy ; one is a radiance amid the night . 
And there are a thousand little cares . 
Nothings , which are enormous in that void . 
The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you , and supplying the vanished universe to you . 
One is caressed with the soul . 
One sees nothing , but one feels that one is adored . 
It is a paradise of shadows . 
It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the other . 
The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M. sur M. On the following day , M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black , and with crape on his hat . 
This mourning was noticed in the town , and commented on .
