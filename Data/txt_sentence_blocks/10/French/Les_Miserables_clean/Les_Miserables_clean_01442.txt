From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon , M. l'Abbe Mabeuf . 
That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice , who had often observed this man gazing at his child , and the scar on his cheek , and the large tears in his eyes . 
That man , who had so manly an air , yet who was weeping like a woman , had struck the warden . 
That face had clung to his mind . 
One day , having gone to Vernon to see his brother , he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge , and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice . 
The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure , and both had paid the colonel a visit , on some pretext or other . 
This visit led to others . 
The colonel , who had been extremely reserved at first , ended by opening his heart , and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history , and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child 's future . 
This caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness , and the colonel , on his side , became fond of the cure . 
And moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier .
