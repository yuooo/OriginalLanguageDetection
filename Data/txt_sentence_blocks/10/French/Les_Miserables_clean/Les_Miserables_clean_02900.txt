The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , we repeat , seemed very calm within .

Combeferre , wearing an apron , was dressing the wounds : Bossuet and Feuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by Gavroche on the dead corporal , and Bossuet said to Feuilly : `` We are soon to take the diligence for another planet '' ; Courfeyrac was disposing and arranging on some paving-stones which he had reserved for himself near Enjolras , a complete arsenal , his sword-cane , his gun , two holster pistols , and a cudgel , with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order . 
Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him .
