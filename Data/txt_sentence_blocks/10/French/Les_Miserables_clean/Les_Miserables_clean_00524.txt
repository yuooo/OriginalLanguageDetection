Ought I to spare myself more than others ? 
No ! 
What ! 
I should be good for nothing but to chastise others , and not myself ! 
Why , I should be a blackguard ! 
Those who say , ` That blackguard of a Javert ! ' 
would be in the right . 
Mr. Mayor , I do not desire that you should treat me kindly ; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others . 
I want none of it for myself . 
The kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen , the police agent against the mayor , the man who is down against the man who is up in the world , is what I call false kindness .
