`` That 's true , '' said Bossuet . 
`` Just see the eyes he is making ! '' 
said Courfeyrac . 
`` But who the deuce is he following ? '' 
`` Some fine , flowery bonneted wench ! 
He 's in love . '' 
`` But , '' observed Bossuet , `` I do n't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street . 
There 's not a woman round . '' 
Courfeyrac took a survey , and exclaimed : -- `` He 's following a man ! '' 
A man , in fact , wearing a gray cap , and whose gray beard could be distinguished , although they only saw his back , was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius .
