What have we to reproach that war with ? 
War does not become a disgrace , the sword does not become a disgrace , except when it is used for assassinating the right , progress , reason , civilization , truth . 
Then war , whether foreign or civil , is iniquitous ; it is called crime . 
Outside the pale of that holy thing , justice , by what right does one form of man despise another ? 
By what right should the sword of Washington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins ? 
Leonidas against the stranger , Timoleon against the tyrant , which is the greater ? 
the one is the defender , the other the liberator . 
Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city 's limits without taking the object into a consideration ? 
Then note the infamy of Brutus , Marcel , Arnould von Blankenheim , Coligny , Hedgerow war ? 
War of the streets ?
