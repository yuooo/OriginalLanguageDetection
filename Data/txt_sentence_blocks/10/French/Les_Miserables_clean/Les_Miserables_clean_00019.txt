To villages where he found no schoolmaster , he quoted once more the people of Queyras : `` Do you know how they manage ? '' 
he said . 
`` Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher , they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley , who make the round of the villages , spending a week in this one , ten days in that , and instruct them . 
These teachers go to the fairs . 
I have seen them there . 
They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat . 
Those who teach reading only have one pen ; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens ; those who teach reading , reckoning , and Latin have three pens . 
But what a disgrace to be ignorant ! 
Do like the people of Queyras ! '' 
Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally ; in default of examples , he invented parables , going directly to the point , with few phrases and many images , which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ .
