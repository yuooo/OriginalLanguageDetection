At the moment of the attack , at the detonation , the physical shock had reached him and had , as it were , awakened him ; he started up abruptly , crossed the room , and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal : `` Does no one volunteer ? '' 
the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine-shop . 
His presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups . 
A shout went up : -- `` It is the voter ! 
It is the member of the Convention ! 
It is the representative of the people ! '' 
It is probable that he did not hear them . 
He strode straight up to Enjolras , the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear ; he tore the flag from Enjolras , who recoiled in amazement and then , since no one dared to stop or to assist him , this old man of eighty , with shaking head but firm foot , began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade . 
This was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried : `` Off with your hats ! '' 
At every step that he mounted , it was a frightful spectacle ; his white locks , his decrepit face , his lofty , bald , and wrinkled brow , his amazed and open mouth , his aged arm upholding the red banner , rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch , and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of '93 emerging from the earth , with the flag of terror in his hand .
