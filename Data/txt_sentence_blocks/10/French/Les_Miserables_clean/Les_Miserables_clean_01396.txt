There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings , among whom swarm types of the strangest , from the porter of la Rapee to the knacker of Montfaucon . 
Fex urbis , exclaims Cicero ; mob , adds Burke , indignantly ; rabble , multitude , populace . 
These are words and quickly uttered . 
But so be it . 
What does it matter ? 
What is it to me if they do go barefoot ! 
They do not know how to read ; so much the worse . 
Would you abandon them for that ? 
Would you turn their distress into a malediction ? 
Can not the light penetrate these masses ?
