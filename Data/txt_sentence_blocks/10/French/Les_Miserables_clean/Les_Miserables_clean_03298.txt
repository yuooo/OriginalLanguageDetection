But there are two things in which I have not succeeded ; in breaking the thread that holds me fixed , riveted and sealed here by the heart , or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone . 
That is why I have come hither to tell you everything this morning . 
Everything or nearly everything . 
It is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself ; I keep that to myself . 
You know the essential points . 
So I have taken my mystery and have brought it to you . 
And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes . 
It was not a resolution that was easy to take . 
I struggled all night long . 
Ah !
