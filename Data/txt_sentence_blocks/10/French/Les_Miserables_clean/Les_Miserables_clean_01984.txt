Whence arises this fault ? 
We will state it . 
Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king ; that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed ; hence excessive timidity , which is displeasing to the people , who have the 14th of July in their civil and Austerlitz in their military tradition . 
Moreover , if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all , that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his family was deserved by the family . 
That domestic group was worthy of admiration . 
Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents . 
One of Louis Philippe 's daughters , Marie d'Orleans , placed the name of her race among artists , as Charles d'Orleans had placed it among poets . 
She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne d'Arc . 
Two of Louis Philippe 's daughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium : `` They are young people such as are rarely seen , and princes such as are never seen . '' 
This , without any dissimulation , and also without any exaggeration , is the truth about Louis Philippe .
