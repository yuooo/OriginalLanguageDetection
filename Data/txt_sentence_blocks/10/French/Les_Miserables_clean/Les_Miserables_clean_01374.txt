These groups , warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday , or indistinctly seen in the twilight , occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time , and these visions mingle with his dreams . 
Paris , centre , banlieue , circumference ; this constitutes all the earth to those children . 
They never venture beyond this . 
They can no more escape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water . 
For them , nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers : Ivry , Gentilly , Arcueil , Belleville , Aubervilliers , Menilmontant , Choisy-le-Roi , Billancourt , Mendon , Issy , Vanvre , Sevres , Puteaux , Neuilly , Gennevilliers , Colombes , Romainville , Chatou , Asnieres , Bougival , Nanterre , Enghien , Noisy-le-Sec , Nogent , Gournay , Drancy , Gonesse ; the universe ends there . 
A BIT OF HISTORY At the epoch , nearly contemporary by the way , when the action of this book takes place , there was not , as there is to-day , a policeman at the corner of every street -LRB- a benefit which there is no time to discuss here -RRB- ; stray children abounded in Paris . 
The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period , by the police patrols , in unenclosed lands , in houses in process of construction , and under the arches of the bridges . 
One of these nests , which has become famous , produced `` the swallows of the bridge of Arcola . '' 
This is , moreover , the most disastrous of social symptoms . 
All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child .
