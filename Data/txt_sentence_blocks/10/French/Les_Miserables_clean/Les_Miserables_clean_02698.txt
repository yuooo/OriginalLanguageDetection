`` Well , '' resumed Combeferre , `` I am going to fasten my handkerchief to my cane , and go as a flag of truce , to offer to exchange our man for theirs . '' 
`` Listen , '' said Enjolras , laying his hand on Combeferre 's arm . 
At the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms . 
They heard a manly voice shout : -- `` Vive la France ! 
Long live France ! 
Long live the future ! '' 
They recognized the voice of Prouvaire . 
A flash passed , a report rang out . 
Silence fell again . 
`` They have killed him , '' exclaimed Combeferre .
