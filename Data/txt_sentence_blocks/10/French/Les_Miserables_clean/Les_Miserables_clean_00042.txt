In addition to this , there was in the garden a stable , which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital , and in which the Bishop kept two cows . 
No matter what the quantity of milk they gave , he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital . 
`` I am paying my tithes , '' he said . 
His bedroom was tolerably large , and rather difficult to warm in bad weather . 
As wood is extremely dear at D -- , he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed . 
Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold : he called it his winter salon . 
In this winter salon , as in the dining-room , there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood , and four straw-seated chairs . 
In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard , painted pink , in water colors . 
Out of a similar sideboard , properly draped with white napery and imitation lace , the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory . 
His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D -- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur 's oratory ; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor .
