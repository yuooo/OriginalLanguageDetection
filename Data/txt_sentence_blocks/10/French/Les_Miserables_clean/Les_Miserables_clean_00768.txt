A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle . 
Quid obscurum , quid divinum . 
Each historian traces , to some extent , the particular feature which pleases him amid this pellmell . 
Whatever may be the combinations of the generals , the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb . 
During the action the plans of the two leaders enter into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape . 
Such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another , just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them . 
It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like ; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen . 
The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread , the trails of blood gush illogically , the fronts of the armies waver , the regiments form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw ; all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other . 
Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives , the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was , the battalions are like smoke . 
There was something there ; seek it .
