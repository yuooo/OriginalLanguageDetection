`` Do you know German ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` So much the worse . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because one of my friends , a publisher , is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia , for which you might have translated English or German articles . 
It is badly paid work , but one can live by it . '' 
`` I will learn English and German . '' 
`` And in the meanwhile ? '' 
`` In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch . '' 
The clothes-dealer was sent for .
