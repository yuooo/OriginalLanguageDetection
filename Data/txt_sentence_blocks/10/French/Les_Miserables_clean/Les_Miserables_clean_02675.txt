Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry . 
Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves , carbines in hand , near the outlet of the grand barricade . 
They no longer addressed each other , they listened , seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching . 
Suddenly , in the midst of the dismal calm , a clear , gay , young voice , which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis , rose and began to sing distinctly , to the old popular air of `` By the Light of the Moon , '' this bit of poetry , terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock : -- Mon nez est en larmes , Mon ami Bugeaud , Prete moi tes gendarmes Pour leur dire un mot . 
En capote bleue , La poule au shako , Voici la banlieue ! 
Co-cocorico ! 
-LSB- 54 -RSB- -LSB- 54 -RSB- My nose is in tears , my friend Bugeaud , lend me thy gendarmes that I may say a word to them . 
With a blue capote and a chicken in his shako , here 's the banlieue , co-cocorico . 
They pressed each other 's hands . 
`` That is Gavroche , '' said Enjolras .
