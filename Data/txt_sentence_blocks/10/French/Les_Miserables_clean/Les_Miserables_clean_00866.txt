This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful , too humble , too prompt in removing his cap to every one , and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes , -- probably affiliated to robber bands , they said ; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall . 
The only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard . 
This is what people thought they had noticed : -- Of late , Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking and care of the road at a very early hour , and to betaking himself to the forest with his pickaxe . 
He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings , in the wildest thickets ; and he had the appearance of being in search of something , and sometimes he was digging holes . 
The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub ; then they recognized Boulatruelle , and were not in the least reassured thereby . 
These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure . 
It was evident that he sought to hide , and that there was some mystery in what he was doing . 
It was said in the village : `` It is clear that the devil has appeared . 
Boulatruelle has seen him , and is on the search . 
In sooth , he is cunning enough to pocket Lucifer 's hoard . ''
