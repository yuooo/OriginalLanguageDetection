The girl stared boldly at her father , and showing the shoes which she had on her feet : -- `` A clever girl , possibly ; but I tell you I wo n't put these shoes on again , and that I wo n't , for the sake of my health , in the first place , and for the sake of cleanliness , in the next . 
I do n't know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch , and go ghi , ghi , ghi , the whole time . 
I prefer to go barefoot . '' 
`` You are right , '' said her father , in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl 's rudeness , `` but then , you will not be allowed to enter churches , for poor people must have shoes to do that . 
One can not go barefoot to the good God , '' he added bitterly . 
Then , returning to the subject which absorbed him : -- `` So you are sure that he will come ? '' 
`` He is following on my heels , '' said she . 
The man started up . 
A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance . 
`` Wife ! ''
