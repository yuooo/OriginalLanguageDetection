At the end of this street , which was very short , he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles by a tall row of houses , and he would have thought himself in a blind alley , had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape . 
This was the Rue Mondetour , which on one side ran into the Rue de Precheurs , and on the other into the Rue du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie . 
At the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac , at the angle of the cutting on the right , there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest , and which formed a sort of cape in the street . 
It is in this house , of two stories only , that an illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before . 
This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old Theophilus described in the following couplet : -- La branle le squelette horrible D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit . 
-LSB- 47 -RSB- -LSB- 47 -RSB- There swings the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself . 
The situation was good , and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there , from father to son . 
In the time of Mathurin Regnier , this cabaret was called the Pot-aux-Roses , and as the rebus was then in fashion , it had for its sign-board , a post -LRB- poteau -RRB- painted rose-color . 
In the last century , the worthy Natoire , one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school , having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the very table where Regnier had drunk his fill , had painted , by way of gratitude , a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post . 
The keeper of the cabaret , in his joy , had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words : `` At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes '' -LRB- `` Au Raisin de Corinthe '' -RRB- .
