The door had fallen wide open . 
He ventured to peep into the next room . 
Nothing had stirred there . 
He lent an ear . 
Nothing was moving in the house . 
The noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one . 
This first danger was past ; but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him . 
Nevertheless , he did not retreat . 
Even when he had thought himself lost , he had not drawn back . 
His only thought now was to finish as soon as possible .
