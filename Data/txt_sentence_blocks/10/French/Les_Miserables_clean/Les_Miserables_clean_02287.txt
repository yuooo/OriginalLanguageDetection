They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles , and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white . 
Then , we 'll go to the Opera . 
We 'll get in with the hired applauders . 
The Opera claque is well managed . 
I would n't associate with the claque on the boulevard . 
At the Opera , just fancy ! 
some of them pay twenty sous , but they 're ninnies . 
They 're called dishclouts . 
And then we 'll go to see the guillotine work . 
I 'll show you the executioner .
