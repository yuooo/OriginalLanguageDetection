`` It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour , '' said Madeleine to the peasants , who were staring at him . 
`` We must ! '' 
`` But it will be too late then ! 
Do n't you see that the cart is sinking ? '' 
`` Well ! '' 
`` Listen , '' resumed Madeleine ; `` there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back . 
Only half a minute , and the poor man can be taken out . 
Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart ? 
There are five louis d'or to be earned ! '' 
Not a man in the group stirred .
