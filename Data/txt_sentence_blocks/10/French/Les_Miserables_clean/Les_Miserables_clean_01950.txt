I surrender . '' 
`` And you ? '' 
Javert asked the rest of the ruffians . 
They replied : -- `` So do we . '' 
Javert began again calmly : -- `` That 's right , that 's good , I said so , you are nice fellows . 
`` I only ask one thing , '' said Bigrenaille , `` and that is , that I may not be denied tobacco while I am in confinement . '' 
`` Granted , '' said Javert . 
And turning round and calling behind him : -- `` Come in now ! '' 
A squad of policemen , sword in hand , and agents armed with bludgeons and cudgels , rushed in at Javert 's summons .
