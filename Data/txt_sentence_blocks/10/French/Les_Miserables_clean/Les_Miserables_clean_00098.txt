The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring : -- `` Yes ? ' 
93 ! '' 
The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity , and exclaimed , so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation : -- `` Ah , there you go ; ' 93 ! 
I was expecting that word . 
A cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years ; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst . 
You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial . '' 
The Bishop felt , without , perhaps , confessing it , that something within him had suffered extinction . 
Nevertheless , he put a good face on the matter . 
He replied : -- `` The judge speaks in the name of justice ; the priest speaks in the name of pity , which is nothing but a more lofty justice . 
A thunderbolt should commit no error . ''
