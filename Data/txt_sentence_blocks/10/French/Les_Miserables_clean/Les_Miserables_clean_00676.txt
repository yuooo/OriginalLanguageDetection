The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons . 
Brevet was a person sixty years of age , who had a sort of business man 's face , and the air of a rascal . 
The two sometimes go together . 
In prison , whither fresh misdeeds had led him , he had become something in the nature of a turnkey . 
He was a man of whom his superiors said , `` He tries to make himself of use . '' 
The chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits . 
It must not be forgotten that this passed under the Restoration . 
`` Brevet , '' said the President , `` you have undergone an ignominious sentence , and you can not take an oath . '' 
Brevet dropped his eyes . 
`` Nevertheless , '' continued the President , `` even in the man whom the law has degraded , there may remain , when the divine mercy permits it , a sentiment of honor and of equity .
