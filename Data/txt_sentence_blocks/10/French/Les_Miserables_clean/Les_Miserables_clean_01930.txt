Only , listen to me a bit . 
My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter . 
I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did , so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her . 
They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind . 
Somewhere , outside the barrier , there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses . 
Your young lady will be taken to it . 
She will alight from the fiacre . 
My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her , and my wife will come back here to tell us : ` It 's done . ' 
As for the young lady , no harm will be done to her ; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet , and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs , she will be returned to you . 
If you have me arrested , my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark , that 's all . ''
