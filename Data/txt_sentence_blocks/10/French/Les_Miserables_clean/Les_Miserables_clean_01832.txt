Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the Gaite Theatre . 
Marius went his way . 
It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men , so strangely hidden behind that wall , and crouching in the snow , could not but bear some relation to Jondrette 's abominable projects . 
That must be the affair . 
He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police . 
He was directed to Rue de Pontoise , No. 14 . 
Thither Marius betook himself . 
As he passed a baker 's shop , he bought a two-penny roll , and ate it , foreseeing that he should not dine . 
On the way , he rendered justice to Providence . 
He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning , he would have followed M. Leblanc 's fiacre , and consequently have remained ignorant of everything , and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost , and his daughter with him , no doubt .
