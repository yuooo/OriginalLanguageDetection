Cosette , in her retreat , encountered a tree and leaned against it . 
Had it not been for this tree , she would have fallen . 
Then she heard his voice , that voice which she had really never heard , barely rising above the rustle of the leaves , and murmuring : -- `` Pardon me , here I am . 
My heart is full . 
I could not live on as I was living , and I have come . 
Have you read what I placed there on the bench ? 
Do you recognize me at all ? 
Have no fear of me . 
It is a long time , you remember the day , since you looked at me at the Luxembourg , near the Gladiator . 
And the day when you passed before me ?
