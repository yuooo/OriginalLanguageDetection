`` Now that I think of it , Father Fauvent , let us give a whole hour to it . 
That is not too much . 
Be near the principal altar , with your iron bar , at eleven o'clock . 
The office begins at midnight . 
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that . '' 
`` I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community . 
These are my orders . 
I am to nail up the coffin . 
At eleven o'clock exactly , I am to be in the chapel . 
The Mother Precentors will be there .
