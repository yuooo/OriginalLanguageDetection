These questions put and answered , he judged society and condemned it . 
He condemned it to his hatred . 
He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering , and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account . 
He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him ; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not , in truth , unjust , but that it most assuredly was iniquitous . 
Anger may be both foolish and absurd ; one can be irritated wrongfully ; one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one 's side at bottom . 
Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated . 
And besides , human society had done him nothing but harm ; he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice , and which it shows to those whom it strikes . 
Men had only touched him to bruise him . 
Every contact with them had been a blow . 
Never , since his infancy , since the days of his mother , of his sister , had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance .
