Marius left the house . 
On the following day , M. Gillenormand said to his daughter : `` You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker , and you will never mention his name to me . '' 
Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of , and not knowing what to do with it , he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months . 
Marius , on his side , had gone forth in indignation . 
There was one circumstance which , it must be admitted , aggravated his exasperation . 
There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas . 
They augment the grievances in such cases , although , in reality , the wrongs are not increased by them . 
While carrying Marius ' `` duds '' precipitately to his chamber , at his grandfather 's command , Nicolette had , inadvertently , let fall , probably , on the attic staircase , which was dark , that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel . 
Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found . 
Marius was convinced that `` Monsieur Gillenormand '' -- from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise -- had flung `` his father 's testament '' in the fire .
