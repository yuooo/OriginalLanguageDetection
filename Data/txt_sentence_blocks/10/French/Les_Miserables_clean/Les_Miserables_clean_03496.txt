It is honest money . 
You may be rich with a tranquil mind . 
Thou must have a carriage , a box at the theatres now and then , and handsome ball dresses , my Cosette , and then , thou must give good dinners to thy friends , and be very happy . 
I was writing to Cosette a while ago . 
She will find my letter . 
I bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece . 
They are of silver , but to me they are gold , they are diamonds ; they change candles which are placed in them into wax-tapers . 
I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high . 
I have done what I could . 
My children , you will not forget that I am a poor man , you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find , under a stone to mark the spot .
