He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms , and one hand on his mouth . 
Then , fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of the dawn , he said : `` The whole army of Paris is to strike . 
A third of the army is bearing down upon the barricades in which you now are . 
There is the National Guard in addition . 
I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line , and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion . 
In one hour you will be attacked . 
As for the populace , it was seething yesterday , to-day it is not stirring . 
There is nothing to expect ; nothing to hope for . 
Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment .
