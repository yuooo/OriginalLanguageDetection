The sewer was the lower world . 
The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police . 
To try that unknown thing , to cast the plummet into that shadow , to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss -- who would have dared ? 
It was alarming . 
Nevertheless , some one did present himself . 
The cess-pool had its Christopher Columbus . 
One day , in 1805 , during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperor made in Paris , the Minister of the Interior , some Decres or Cretet or other , came to the master 's intimate levee . 
In the Carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of the great Republic , and of the great Empire ; then Napoleon 's door was blocked with heroes ; men from the Rhine , from the Escaut , from the Adige , and from the Nile ; companions of Joubert , of Desaix , of Marceau , of Hoche , of Kleber ; the aerostiers of Fleurus , the grenadiers of Mayence , the pontoon-builders of Genoa , hussars whom the Pyramids had looked down upon , artillerists whom Junot 's cannon-ball had spattered with mud , cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the Zuyderzee ; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi , others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua , others had preceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello . 
The whole army of that day was present there , in the court-yard of the Tuileries , represented by a squadron or a platoon , and guarding Napoleon in repose ; and that was the splendid epoch when the grand army had Marengo behind it and Austerlitz before it . 
-- `` Sire , '' said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon , `` yesterday I saw the most intrepid man in your Empire . ''
