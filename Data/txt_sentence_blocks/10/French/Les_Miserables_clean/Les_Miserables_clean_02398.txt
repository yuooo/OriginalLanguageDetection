Bahorel replied : -- `` What do you expect ? 
There 's always a petard in a seminary fellow . '' 
At times , Courfeyrac folded his arms , assumed a serious air , and said to Marius : -- `` You are getting irregular in your habits , young man . '' 
Courfeyrac , being a practical man , did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius ; he was not much in the habit of concealed passions ; it made him impatient , and now and then he called upon Marius to come back to reality . 
One morning , he threw him this admonition : -- `` My dear fellow , you produce upon me the effect of being located in the moon , the realm of dreams , the province of illusions , capital , soap-bubble . 
Come , be a good boy , what 's her name ? '' 
But nothing could induce Marius `` to talk . '' 
They might have torn out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name , Cosette , was composed . 
True love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb . 
Only , Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius , that his taciturnity was of the beaming order .
