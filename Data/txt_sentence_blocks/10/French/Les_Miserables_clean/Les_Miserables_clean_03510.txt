You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes ! 
Something very similar has been done in France . 
Stay , let us pass miseries in review , let each one contribute his pile , you are as rich as we . 
Have you not , like ourselves , two condemnations , religious condemnation pronounced by the priest , and social condemnation decreed by the judge ? 
Oh , great nation of Italy , thou resemblest the great nation of France ! 
Alas ! 
our brothers , you are , like ourselves , Miserables . 
From the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell , you do not see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of Eden . 
Only , the priests are mistaken . 
These holy portals are before and not behind us .
