He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and the long , bifurcated corridor of the Chaussee d'Antin . 
A little beyond an affluent , which was , probably , the Madeleine branch , he halted . 
He was extremely weary . 
A passably large air-hole , probably the man-hole in the Rue d'Anjou , furnished a light that was almost vivid . 
Jean Valjean , with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother , deposited Marius on the banquette of the sewer . 
Marius ' blood-stained face appeared under the wan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb . 
His eyes were closed , his hair was plastered down on his temples like a painter 's brushes dried in red wash ; his hands hung limp and dead . 
A clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat ; his limbs were cold , and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth ; his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds , the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh . 
Jean Valjean , pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers , laid his hand upon Marius ' breast ; his heart was still beating . 
Jean Valjean tore up his shirt , bandaged the young man 's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood ; then bending over Marius , who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing , in that half light , he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred .
