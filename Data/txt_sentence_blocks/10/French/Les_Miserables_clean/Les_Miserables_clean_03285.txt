These words : `` I am an ex-convict , '' proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the ear of Marius overshot the possible . 
It seemed to him that something had just been said to him ; but he did not know what . 
He stood with his mouth wide open . 
Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful . 
Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state , he had not , up to that moment , observed the other man 's terrible pallor . 
Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm , unrolled the linen from around his hand , bared his thumb and showed it to Marius . 
`` There is nothing the matter with my hand , '' said he . 
Marius looked at the thumb . 
`` There has not been anything the matter with it , '' went on Jean Valjean . 
There was , in fact , no trace of any injury .
