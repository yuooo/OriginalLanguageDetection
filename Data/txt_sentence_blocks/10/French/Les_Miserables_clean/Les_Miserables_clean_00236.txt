Night descends ; he has been swimming for hours ; his strength is exhausted ; that ship , that distant thing in which there were men , has vanished ; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf ; he sinks , he stiffens himself , he twists himself ; he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible ; he shouts . 
There are no more men . 
Where is God ? 
He shouts . 
Help ! 
Help ! 
He still shouts on . 
Nothing on the horizon ; nothing in heaven . 
He implores the expanse , the waves , the seaweed , the reef ; they are deaf . 
He beseeches the tempest ; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite .
