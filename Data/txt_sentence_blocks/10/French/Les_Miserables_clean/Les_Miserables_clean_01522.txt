He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas : he said : `` Revolution , but civilization '' ; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky . 
The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras . 
Enjolras expressed its divine right , and Combeferre its natural right . 
The first attached himself to Robespierre ; the second confined himself to Condorcet . 
Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras . 
If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history , the one would have been the just , the other the wise man . 
Enjolras was the more virile , Combeferre the more humane . 
Homo and vir , that was the exact effect of their different shades . 
Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe , through natural whiteness . 
He loved the word citizen , but he preferred the word man .
