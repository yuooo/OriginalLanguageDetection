The universe appeared to him like an immense malady ; everywhere he felt fever , everywhere he heard the sound of suffering , and , without seeking to solve the enigma , he strove to dress the wound . 
The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him ; he was occupied only in finding for himself , and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve . 
That which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation . 
There are men who toil at extracting gold ; he toiled at the extraction of pity . 
Universal misery was his mine . 
The sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness . 
Love each other ; he declared this to be complete , desired nothing further , and that was the whole of his doctrine . 
One day , that man who believed himself to be a `` philosopher , '' the senator who has already been alluded to , said to the Bishop : `` Just survey the spectacle of the world : all war against all ; the strongest has the most wit . 
Your love each other is nonsense . '' 
-- `` Well , '' replied Monseigneur Welcome , without contesting the point , `` if it is nonsense , the soul should shut itself up in it , as the pearl in the oyster . ''
