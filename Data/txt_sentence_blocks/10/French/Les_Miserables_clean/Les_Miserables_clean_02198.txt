In point of fact , there was a man in the garden , with a large club in his hand . 
Just as she was about to scream , the moon lighted up the man 's profile . 
It was her father . 
She returned to her bed , saying to herself : `` He is very uneasy ! '' 
Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden . 
Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter . 
On the third night , the moon was on the wane , and had begun to rise later ; at one o'clock in the morning , possibly , she heard a loud burst of laughter and her father 's voice calling her : -- `` Cosette ! '' 
She jumped out of bed , threw on her dressing-gown , and opened her window . 
Her father was standing on the grass-plot below . 
`` I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you , '' said he ; `` look , there is your shadow with the round hat . ''
