In the second place , and no offence to Combeferre , a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization . 
To save the transition , to soften the passage , to deaden the shock , to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional fictions , -- what detestable reasons all those are ! 
No ! 
no ! 
let us never enlighten the people with false daylight . 
Principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar . 
No illegitimacy , no compromise , no grant from the king to the people . 
In all such grants there is an Article 14 . 
By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back . 
I refuse your charter point-blank .
