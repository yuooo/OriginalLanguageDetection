In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie , twenty young men , bearded and with long hair , entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later , carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape , and having at their head three men armed , one with a sword , one with a gun , and the third with a pike . 
In the Rue des Nonaindieres , a very well-dressed bourgeois , who had a prominent belly , a sonorous voice , a bald head , a lofty brow , a black beard , and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat , offered cartridges publicly to passers-by . 
In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre , men with bare arms carried about a black flag , on which could be read in white letters this inscription : `` Republic or Death ! '' 
In the Rue des Jeuneurs , Rue du Cadran , Rue Montorgueil , Rue Mandar , groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters , the word section with a number . 
One of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between . 
They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin , and three armorers ' shops , the first in the Rue Beaubourg , the second in the Rue Michel-le-Comte , the other in the Rue du Temple . 
In a few minutes , the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns , nearly all double-barrelled , sixty-four swords , and eighty-three pistols . 
In order to provide more arms , one man took the gun , the other the bayonet . 
Opposite the Quai de la Greve , young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing . 
One of them had a flint-lock .
