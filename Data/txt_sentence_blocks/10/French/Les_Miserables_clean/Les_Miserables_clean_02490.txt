He put this unique copy under his arm , and went out . 
It was the 4th of June , 1832 ; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques , to Royal 's successor , and returned with one hundred francs . 
He laid the pile of five-franc pieces on the old serving-woman 's nightstand , and returned to his chamber without saying a word .

He saw a gardener passing , and inquired : -- `` What is it ? '' 
The gardener , spade on back , replied in the most unconcerned tone : -- `` It is the riots . ''
