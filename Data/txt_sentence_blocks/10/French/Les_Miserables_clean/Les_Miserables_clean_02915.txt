Javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjean as `` thou . '' 
`` Be off with you , '' said Jean Valjean . 
Javert retreated slowly . 
A moment later he turned the corner of the Rue des Precheurs . 
When Javert had disappeared , Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air . 
Then he returned to the barricade and said : `` It is done . '' 
In the meanwhile , this is what had taken place . 
Marius , more intent on the outside than on the interior , had not , up to that time , taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the tap-room . 
When he beheld him in broad daylight , striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death , he recognized him . 
Something suddenly recurred to his mind .
