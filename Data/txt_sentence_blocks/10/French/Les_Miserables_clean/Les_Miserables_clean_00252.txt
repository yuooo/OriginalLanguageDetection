At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed , this cloud parted , as though on purpose , and a ray of light , traversing the long window , suddenly illuminated the Bishop 's pale face . 
He was sleeping peacefully . 
He lay in his bed almost completely dressed , on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps , in a garment of brown wool , which covered his arms to the wrists . 
His head was thrown back on the pillow , in the careless attitude of repose ; his hand , adorned with the pastoral ring , and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions , was hanging over the edge of the bed . 
His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction , of hope , and of felicity . 
It was more than a smile , and almost a radiance . 
He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible . 
The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven . 
A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop . 
It was , at the same time , a luminous transparency , for that heaven was within him .
