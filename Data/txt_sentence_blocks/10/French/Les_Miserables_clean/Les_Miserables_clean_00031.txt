He passed the entire day with him , forgetful of food and sleep , praying to God for the soul of the condemned man , and praying the condemned man for his own . 
He told him the best truths , which are also the most simple . 
He was father , brother , friend ; he was bishop only to bless . 
He taught him everything , encouraged and consoled him . 
The man was on the point of dying in despair . 
Death was an abyss to him . 
As he stood trembling on its mournful brink , he recoiled with horror . 
He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent . 
His condemnation , which had been a profound shock , had , in a manner , broken through , here and there , that wall which separates us from the mystery of things , and which we call life . 
He gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches , and beheld only darkness .
