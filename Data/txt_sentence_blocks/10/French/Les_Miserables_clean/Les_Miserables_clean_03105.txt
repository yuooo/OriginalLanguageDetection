In vain did he struggle , he was reduced to confess , in his inmost heart , the sublimity of that wretch . 
This was odious . 
A benevolent malefactor , merciful , gentle , helpful , clement , a convict , returning good for evil , giving back pardon for hatred , preferring pity to vengeance , preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy , saving him who had smitten him , kneeling on the heights of virtue , more nearly akin to an angel than to a man . 
Javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed . 
Things could not go on in this manner . 
Certainly , and we insist upon this point , he had not yielded without resistance to that monster , to that infamous angel , to that hideous hero , who enraged almost as much as he amazed him . 
Twenty times , as he sat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean , the legal tiger had roared within him . 
A score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon Jean Valjean , to seize him and devour him , that is to say , to arrest him . 
What more simple , in fact ? 
To cry out at the first post that they passed : -- `` Here is a fugitive from justice , who has broken his ban ! ''
