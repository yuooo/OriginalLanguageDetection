I resume . 
This book , Les Miserables , is no less your mirror than ours . 
Certain men , certain castes , rise in revolt against this book , -- I understand that . 
Mirrors , those revealers of the truth , are hated ; that does not prevent them from being of use . 
As for myself , I have written for all , with a profound love for my own country , but without being engrossed by France more than by any other nation . 
In proportion as I advance in life , I grow more simple , and I become more and more patriotic for humanity . 
This is , moreover , the tendency of our age , and the law of radiance of the French Revolution ; books must cease to be exclusively French , Italian , German , Spanish , or English , and become European , I say more , human , if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization . 
Hence a new logic of art , and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything , even the conditions , formerly narrow , of taste and language , which must grow broader like all the rest . 
In France , certain critics have reproached me , to my great delight , with having transgressed the bounds of what they call `` French taste '' ; I should be glad if this eulogium were merited . 
In short , I am doing what I can , I suffer with the same universal suffering , and I try to assuage it , I possess only the puny forces of a man , and I cry to all : `` Help me ! ''
