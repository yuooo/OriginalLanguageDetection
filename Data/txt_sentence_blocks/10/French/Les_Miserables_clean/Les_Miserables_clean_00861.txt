The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at M. sur M . 
Some papers , among others the Constitutional , presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party . 
Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys . 
He was called 9,430 . 
However , and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject , the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished with M. Madeleine ; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized ; lacking him , there actually was a soul lacking . 
After this fall , there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen , that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day , obscurely , in the human community , and which history has noted only once , because it occurred after the death of Alexander . 
Lieutenants are crowned kings ; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves . 
Envious rivalries arose . 
M. Madeleine 's vast workshops were shut ; his buildings fell to ruin , his workmen were scattered . 
Some of them quitted the country , others abandoned the trade .
