What had taken place may be related in a few words . 
Eponine had been the cause of everything . 
After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a double idea , to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet , and to separate Marius and Cosette . 
She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman , while Eponine disguised herself like a man . 
It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning : `` Leave your house . '' 
Jean Valjean had , in fact , returned home , and had said to Cosette : `` We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme Arme with Toussaint . 
Next week , we shall be in London . '' 
Cosette , utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow , had hastily penned a couple of lines to Marius . 
But how was she to get the letter to the post ? 
She never went out alone , and Toussaint , surprised at such a commission , would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent .
