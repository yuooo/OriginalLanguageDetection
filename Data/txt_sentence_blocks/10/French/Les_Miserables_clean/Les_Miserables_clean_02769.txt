But what was June , 1848 , at bottom ? 
A revolt of the people against itself . 
Where the subject is not lost sight of , there is no digression ; may we , then , be permitted to arrest the reader 's attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterized this insurrection . 
One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine ; the other defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple ; those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of June , will never forget them . 
The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous ; it was three stories high , and seven hundred feet wide . 
It barred the vast opening of the faubourg , that is to say , three streets , from angle to angle ; ravined , jagged , cut up , divided , crenelated , with an immense rent , buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there , powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg , it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the 14th of July . 
Nineteen barricades were ranged , one behind the other , in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade . 
At the very sight of it , one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg , which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe . 
Of what was that barricade made ? 
Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly , said some .
