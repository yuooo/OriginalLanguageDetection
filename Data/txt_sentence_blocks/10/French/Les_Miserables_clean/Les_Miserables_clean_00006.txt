The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment ; and this memorable date , the 29th of July , 1714 , was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble . 
The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story , with a small garden . 
Three days after his arrival , the Bishop visited the hospital . 
The visit ended , he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house . 
`` Monsieur the director of the hospital , '' said he to him , `` how many sick people have you at the present moment ? '' 
`` Twenty-six , Monseigneur . '' 
`` That was the number which I counted , '' said the Bishop . 
`` The beds , '' pursued the director , `` are very much crowded against each other . '' 
`` That is what I observed . '' 
`` The halls are nothing but rooms , and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them . ''
