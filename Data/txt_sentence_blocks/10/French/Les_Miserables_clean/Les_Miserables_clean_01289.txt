`` Who nails up the coffin ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Who spreads the pall over it ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Are you alone ? '' 
`` Not another man , except the police doctor , can enter the dead-room . 
That is even written on the wall . '' 
`` Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep ? '' 
`` No . 
But I could hide you in a small , dark nook which opens on the dead-room , where I keep my tools to use for burials , and of which I have the key . ''
