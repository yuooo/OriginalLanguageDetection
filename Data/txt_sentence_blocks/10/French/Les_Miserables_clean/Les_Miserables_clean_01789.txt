I do not jest , that I do n't ! 
I read them lessons on honor , on morality , on virtue ! 
Ask them ! 
They have got to walk straight . 
They are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family , and end by espousing the public . 
One is Mamselle Nobody , and one becomes Madame Everybody . 
Deuce take it ! 
None of that in the Fabantou family ! 
I mean to bring them up virtuously , and they shall be honest , and nice , and believe in God , by the sacred name ! 
Well , sir , my worthy sir , do you know what is going to happen to-morrow ?
