For if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive , any ordinary and charitable man , evidently their indigence would have been noticed , their signals of distress would have been perceived , and they would have been taken hold of and rescued ! 
They appeared very corrupt and very depraved , no doubt , very vile , very odious even ; but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare ; besides , there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word , a fatal word , the miserable ; whose fault is this ? 
And then should not the charity be all the more profound , in proportion as the fall is great ? 
While reading himself this moral lesson , for there were occasions on which Marius , like all truly honest hearts , was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved , he stared at the wall which separated him from the Jondrettes , as though he were able to make his gaze , full of pity , penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people . 
The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams , and , as the reader had just learned , it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished . 
Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this long before . 
There was no paper pasted on the wall , either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius ; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness . 
Marius examined the partition , almost unconsciously ; sometimes revery examines , observes , and scrutinizes as thought would . 
All at once he sprang up ; he had just perceived , near the top , close to the ceiling , a triangular hole , which resulted from the space between three lathes . 
The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing , and by mounting on the commode , a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes ' attic .
