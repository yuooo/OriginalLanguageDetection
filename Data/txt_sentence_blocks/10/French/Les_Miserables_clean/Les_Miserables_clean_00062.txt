`` Good devils even , '' said the Bishop . 
`` I declare to you , '' continued the senator , `` that the Marquis d'Argens , Pyrrhon , Hobbes , and M. Naigeon are no rascals . 
I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges . '' 
`` Like yourself , Count , '' interposed the Bishop . 
The senator resumed : -- `` I hate Diderot ; he is an ideologist , a declaimer , and a revolutionist , a believer in God at bottom , and more bigoted than Voltaire . 
Voltaire made sport of Needham , and he was wrong , for Needham 's eels prove that God is useless . 
A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux . 
Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger ; you have the world . 
Man is the eel . 
Then what is the good of the Eternal Father ?
