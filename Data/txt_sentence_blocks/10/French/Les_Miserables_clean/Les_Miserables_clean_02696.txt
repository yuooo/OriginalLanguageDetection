In the meanwhile , the assailants did not stir , they could be heard marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not venture into it , either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt . 
The insurgents had posted sentinels , and some of them , who were medical students , set about caring for the wounded . 
They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop , with the exception of the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges , and of the one on which lay Father Mabeuf ; they had added them to the barricade , and had replaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of the widow Hucheloup and her servants . 
On these mattresses they had laid the wounded . 
As for the three poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe , no one knew what had become of them . 
They were finally found , however , hidden in the cellar . 
A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade . 
The roll was called . 
One of the insurgents was missing . 
And who was it ?
