The man who makes his escape , we repeat , is inspired ; there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight ; the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime , and one says of the escaped thief : `` How did he contrive to scale that wall ? '' 
in the same way that one says of Corneille : `` Where did he find the means of dying ? '' 
At all events , dripping with perspiration , drenched with rain , with his clothes hanging in ribbons , his hands flayed , his elbows bleeding , his knees torn , Thenardier had reached what children , in their figurative language , call the edge of the wall of the ruin , there he had stretched himself out at full length , and there his strength had failed him . 
A steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the street . 
The rope which he had was too short . 
There he waited , pale , exhausted , desperate with all the despair which he had undergone , still hidden by the night , but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning , alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes , an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof , staring in horror at a terrible depth , at the light of the street lanterns , the wet , black pavement , that pavement longed for yet frightful , which meant death , and which meant liberty . 
He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded , if they had heard him , and if they would come to his assistance . 
He listened . 
With the exception of the patrol , no one had passed through the street since he had been there . 
Nearly the whole of the descent of the market-gardeners from Montreuil , from Charonne , from Vincennes , and from Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue Saint-Antoine .
