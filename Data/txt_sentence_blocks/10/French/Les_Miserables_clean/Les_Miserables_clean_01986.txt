At the age of four and twenty , in ' 93 , being then M. de Chartres , he had witnessed , from the depth of a box , the trial of Louis XVI. , so well named that poor tyrant . 
The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution , breaking royalty in the King and the King with royalty , did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea , the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal , the public wrath interrogating , Capet not knowing what to reply , the alarming , stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath , the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe , of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned , -- he had looked on those things , he had contemplated that giddiness ; he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention ; he had beheld , behind Louis XVI. , that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible , the terrible culprit , the monarchy , rise through the shadows ; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace , which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God . 
The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious . 
Its memory was like a living imprint of those great years , minute by minute . 
One day , in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt , he rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list of the Constituent Assembly . 
Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight . 
While he reigned the press was free , the tribune was free , conscience and speech were free . 
The laws of September are open to sight . 
Although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges , he left his throne exposed to the light . 
History will do justice to him for this loyalty .
