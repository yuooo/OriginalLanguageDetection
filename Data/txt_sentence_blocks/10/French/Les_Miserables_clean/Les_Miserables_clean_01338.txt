there he is , stifled , ' I should have gone raving mad , mad enough for a strait jacket . 
They would have put me in Bicetre . 
What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead ? 
And your little girl ? 
There 's that fruit-seller , -- she would never have understood it ! 
The child is thrust into your arms , and then -- the grandfather is dead ! 
What a story ! 
good saints of paradise , what a tale ! 
Ah ! 
you are alive , that 's the best of it ! ''
