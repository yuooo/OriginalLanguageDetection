Fantine was innocence floating high over fault . 
THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY That day was composed of dawn , from one end to the other . 
All nature seemed to be having a holiday , and to be laughing . 
The flower-beds of Saint-Cloud perfumed the air ; the breath of the Seine rustled the leaves vaguely ; the branches gesticulated in the wind , bees pillaged the jasmines ; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow , the clover , and the sterile oats ; in the august park of the King of France there was a pack of vagabonds , the birds . 
The four merry couples , mingled with the sun , the fields , the flowers , the trees , were resplendent . 
And in this community of Paradise , talking , singing , running , dancing , chasing butterflies , plucking convolvulus , wetting their pink , open-work stockings in the tall grass , fresh , wild , without malice , all received , to some extent , the kisses of all , with the exception of Fantine , who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness , and who was in love . 
`` You always have a queer look about you , '' said Favourite to her . 
Such things are joys . 
These passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature , and make a caress and light spring forth from everything . 
There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love , -- in that eternal hedge-school of lovers , which is forever beginning anew , and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars .
