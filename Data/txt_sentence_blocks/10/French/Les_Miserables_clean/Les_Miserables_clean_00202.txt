`` The man recovered his animation as he ate . 
My brother made him drink that good Mauves wine , which he does not drink himself , because he says that wine is expensive . 
My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted , interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me . 
He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin , as though he wished the man to understand , without advising him directly and harshly , that this would afford him a refuge . 
One thing struck me . 
This man was what I have told you . 
Well , neither during supper , nor during the entire evening , did my brother utter a single word , with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered , which could remind the man of what he was , nor of what my brother was . 
To all appearances , it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon , and of impressing the Bishop on the convict , so that a mark of the passage might remain behind . 
This might have appeared to any one else who had this , unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body , and to bestow upon him some reproach , seasoned with moralizing and advice , or a little commiseration , with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future . 
My brother did not even ask him from what country he came , nor what was his history .
