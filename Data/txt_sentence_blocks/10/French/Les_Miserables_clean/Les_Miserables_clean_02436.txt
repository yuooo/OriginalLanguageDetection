`` I ? 
I said nothing . '' 
`` What do you hope , then ? '' 
`` Wait until the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` Yes , Cosette . ''

Marius resumed : -- `` Now that I think of it , you ought to know my address : something might happen , one never knows ; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac , Rue de la Verrerie , No. 16 . ''
