The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D -- lived , would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand . 
Like all old men , and like the majority of thinkers , he slept little . 
This brief slumber was profound . 
In the morning he meditated for an hour , then he said his mass , either at the cathedral or in his own house . 
His mass said , he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows . 
Then he set to work . 
A Bishop is a very busy man : he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric , who is generally a canon , and nearly every day his vicars-general . 
He has congregations to reprove , privileges to grant , a whole ecclesiastical library to examine , -- prayer-books , diocesan catechisms , books of hours , etc. , -- charges to write , sermons to authorize , cures and mayors to reconcile , a clerical correspondence , an administrative correspondence ; on one side the State , on the other the Holy See ; and a thousand matters of business . 
What time was left to him , after these thousand details of business , and his offices and his breviary , he bestowed first on the necessitous , the sick , and the afflicted ; the time which was left to him from the afflicted , the sick , and the necessitous , he devoted to work . 
Sometimes he dug in his garden ; again , he read or wrote .
