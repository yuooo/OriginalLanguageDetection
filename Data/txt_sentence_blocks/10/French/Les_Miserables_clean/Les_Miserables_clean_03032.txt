Behold him in the sand up to his belly , the sand reaches to his breast , he is only a bust now . 
He uplifts his hands , utters furious groans , clenches his nails on the beach , tries to cling fast to that ashes , supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath , and sobs frantically ; the sand mounts higher . 
The sand has reached his shoulders , the sand reaches to his throat ; only his face is visible now . 
His mouth cries aloud , the sand fills it ; silence . 
His eyes still gaze forth , the sand closes them , night . 
Then his brow decreases , a little hair quivers above the sand ; a hand projects , pierces the surface of the beach , waves and disappears . 
Sinister obliteration of a man . 
Sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse ; sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his cart ; all founders in that strand . 
It is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water . 
It is the earth drowning a man .
