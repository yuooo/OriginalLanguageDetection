He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic . 
He was the marble lover of liberty . 
His speech was harshly inspired , and had the thrill of a hymn . 
He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul . 
Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him ! 
If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais , seeing that face of a youth escaped from college , that page 's mien , those long , golden lashes , those blue eyes , that hair billowing in the wind , those rosy cheeks , those fresh lips , those exquisite teeth , had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora , and had tried her beauty on Enjolras , an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss , and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais . 
By the side of Enjolras , who represented the logic of the Revolution , Combeferre represented its philosophy . 
Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference -- that its logic may end in war , whereas its philosophy can end only in peace . 
Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras . 
He was less lofty , but broader .
