This old dame had once been young -- astonishing fact ! 
In her youth , in ' 93 , she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap , and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins . 
She was dry , rough , peevish , sharp , captious , almost venomous ; all this in memory of her monk , whose widow she was , and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will . 
She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible . 
At the Restoration she had turned bigot , and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk . 
She had a small property , which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community . 
She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras . 
So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil , and returned with the remark , `` I have seen the child . '' 
All this took time . 
Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year , when , one morning , the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor , told her that she was no longer employed in the shop , and requested her , in the mayor 's name , to leave the neighborhood .
