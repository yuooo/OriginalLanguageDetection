I say all ! 
I know not one ! 
I say all ! 
Do you hear me , Marius ! 
See here , you are no more a baron than my slipper is ! 
They were all bandits in the service of Robespierre ! 
All who served B-u-o-naparte were brigands ! 
They were all traitors who betrayed , betrayed , betrayed their legitimate king ! 
All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the English at Waterloo ! 
That is what I do know !
