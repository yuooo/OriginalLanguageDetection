He had his fifth horse killed under him there . 
Perspiring , his eyes aflame , foaming at the mouth , with uniform unbuttoned , one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from a horseguard , his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet ; bleeding , bemired , magnificent , a broken sword in his hand , he said , `` Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle ! '' 
But in vain ; he did not die . 
He was haggard and angry . 
At Drouet d'Erlon he hurled this question , `` Are you not going to get yourself killed ? '' 
In the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men , he shouted : `` So there is nothing for me ! 
Oh ! 
I should like to have all these English bullets enter my bowels ! '' 
Unhappy man , thou wert reserved for French bullets ! 
THE CATASTROPHE The rout behind the Guard was melancholy .
