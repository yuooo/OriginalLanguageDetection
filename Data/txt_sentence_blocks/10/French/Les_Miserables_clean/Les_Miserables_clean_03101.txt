Destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible , and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice . 
Javert had reached one of those extremities . 
One of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think . 
The very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it . 
Thought was something to which he was unused , and which was peculiarly painful . 
In thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion ; and it irritated him to have that within him . 
Thought on any subject whatever , outside of the restricted circle of his functions , would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue ; thought on the day which had just passed was a torture . 
Nevertheless , it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience , after such shocks , and render to himself an account of himself . 
What he had just done made him shudder . 
He , Javert , had seen fit to decide , contrary to all the regulations of the police , contrary to the whole social and judicial organization , contrary to the entire code , upon a release ; this had suited him ; he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public ; was not this unjustifiable ?
