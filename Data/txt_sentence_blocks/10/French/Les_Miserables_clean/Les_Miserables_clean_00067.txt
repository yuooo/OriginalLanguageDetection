We are souls , and we shall be angels , with blue wings on our shoulder-blades . 
Do come to my assistance : is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star ? 
Very well . 
We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars . 
And then , besides , we shall see God . 
Ta , ta , ta ! 
What twaddle all these paradises are ! 
God is a nonsensical monster . 
I would not say that in the Moniteur , egad ! 
but I may whisper it among friends .
