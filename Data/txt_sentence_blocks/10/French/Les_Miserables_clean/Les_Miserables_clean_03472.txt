Stay , Marius , feel how cold his hand is ! '' 
`` So you are here ! 
Monsieur Pontmercy , you pardon me ! '' 
repeated Jean Valjean . 
At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more , all that was swelling Marius ' heart found vent . 
He burst forth : `` Cosette , do you hear ? 
he has come to that ! 
he asks my forgiveness ! 
And do you know what he has done for me , Cosette ? 
He has saved my life .
