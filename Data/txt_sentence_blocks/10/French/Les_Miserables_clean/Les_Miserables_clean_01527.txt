This orphan had adopted the peoples . 
As his mother had failed him , he meditated on his country . 
He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case . 
In this club of young Utopians , occupied chiefly with France , he represented the outside world . 
He had for his specialty Greece , Poland , Hungary , Roumania , Italy . 
He uttered these names incessantly , appropriately and inappropriately , with the tenacity of right . 
The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly , of Russia on Warsaw , of Austria on Venice , enraged him . 
Above all things , the great violence of 1772 aroused him . 
There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation ; he was eloquent with that eloquence . 
He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772 , on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason , and that three-sided crime , on that monstrous ambush , the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states , which , since that time , have struck many a noble nation , and have annulled their certificate of birth , so to speak .
