Sit down , sir . 
Well , you have had a revolution since I had the honor to see you last . 
The Jacobins got the upper hand . 
You must have been delighted . 
Are you not a Republican since you are a Baron ? 
You can make that agree . 
The Republic makes a good sauce for the barony . 
Are you one of those decorated by July ? 
Have you taken the Louvre at all , sir ? 
Quite near here , in the Rue Saint-Antoine , opposite the Rue des Nonamdieres , there is a cannon-ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription : ` July 28th , 1830 . '
