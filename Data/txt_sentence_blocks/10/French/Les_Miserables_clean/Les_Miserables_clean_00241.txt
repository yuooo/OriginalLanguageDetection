When evening arrived , as he was forced to set out again on the following day , he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid . 
The owner did not utter a word , but handed him fifteen sous . 
He objected . 
He was told , `` That is enough for thee . '' 
He persisted . 
The master looked him straight between the eyes , and said to him `` Beware of the prison . '' 
There , again , he considered that he had been robbed . 
Society , the State , by diminishing his hoard , had robbed him wholesale . 
Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail . 
Liberation is not deliverance .
