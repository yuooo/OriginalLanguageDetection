Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil . 
He had never known a `` kind woman friend '' in his native parts . 
He had not had the time to fall in love . 
He returned at night weary , and ate his broth without uttering a word . 
His sister , mother Jeanne , often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating , -- a bit of meat , a slice of bacon , the heart of the cabbage , -- to give to one of her children . 
As he went on eating , with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup , his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes , he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it . 
There was at Faverolles , not far from the Valjean thatched cottage , on the other side of the lane , a farmer 's wife named Marie-Claude ; the Valjean children , habitually famished , sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk , in their mother 's name , which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner , snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks . 
If their mother had known of this marauding , she would have punished the delinquents severely . 
Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their mother 's back , and the children were not punished . 
In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day ; then he hired out as a hay-maker , as laborer , as neat-herd on a farm , as a drudge .
