I shall eat . 
It is better to be the tooth than the grass . 
Such is my wisdom . 
After which , go whither I push thee , the grave-digger is there ; the Pantheon for some of us : all falls into the great hole . 
End . 
Finis . 
Total liquidation . 
This is the vanishing-point . 
Death is death , believe me . 
I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject .
