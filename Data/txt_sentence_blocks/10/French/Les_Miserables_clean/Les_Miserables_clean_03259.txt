All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been carried away ; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls . 
Toussaint 's bed was despoiled in like manner . 
One bed only was made up , and seemed to be waiting some one , and this was Jean Valjean 's bed . 
Jean Valjean looked at the walls , closed some of the cupboard doors , and went and came from one room to another . 
Then he sought his own chamber once more , and set his candle on a table . 
He had disengaged his arm from the sling , and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him . 
He approached his bed , and his eyes rested , was it by chance ? 
was it intentionally ? 
on the inseparable of which Cosette had been jealous , on the little portmanteau which never left him . 
On his arrival in the Rue de l'Homme Arme , on the 4th of June , he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed .
