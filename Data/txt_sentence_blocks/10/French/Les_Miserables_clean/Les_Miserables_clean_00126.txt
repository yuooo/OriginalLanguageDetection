How many blushing choristers , how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette 's pot of milk ! 
Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation ? 
in good faith , perchance , and deceiving itself , devotee that it is . 
Monseigneur Bienvenu , poor , humble , retiring , was not accounted among the big mitres . 
This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him . 
We have seen that he `` did not take '' in Paris . 
Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man . 
Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow . 
His canons and grand-vicars were good old men , rather vulgar like himself , walled up like him in this diocese , without exit to a cardinalship , and who resembled their bishop , with this difference , that they were finished and he was completed . 
The impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood , that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch , and went off in a great hurry .
