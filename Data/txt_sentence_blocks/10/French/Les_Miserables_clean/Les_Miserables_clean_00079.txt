He risks himself as he sees fit . 
I carry off Madam Magloire , I enter my chamber , I pray for him and fall asleep . 
I am at ease , because I know that if anything were to happen to him , it would be the end of me . 
I should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop . 
It has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences . 
But now the habit has been acquired . 
We pray together , we tremble together , and we fall asleep . 
If the devil were to enter this house , he would be allowed to do so . 
After all , what is there for us to fear in this house ? 
There is always some one with us who is stronger than we .
