Solem quis dicere falsum audeat ? 
Who shall dare to say that the sun is false ? 
Thus certain geniuses , themselves , certain Very-Lofty mortals , man-stars , may be mistaken ? 
That which is on high at the summit , at the crest , at the zenith , that which sends down so much light on the earth , sees but little , sees badly , sees not at all ? 
Is not this a desperate state of things ? 
No . 
But what is there , then , above the sun ? 
The god . 
On the 6th of June , 1832 , about eleven o'clock in the morning , the Luxembourg , solitary and depopulated , was charming . 
The quincunxes and flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight .
