AN OWL 'S VIEW OF PARIS A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle . 
All that old quarter of the Halles , which is like a city within a city , through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin , where a thousand lanes cross , and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold , would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris . 
There the glance fell into an abyss . 
Thanks to the broken lanterns , thanks to the closed windows , there all radiance , all life , all sound , all movement ceased . 
The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere , and maintained order , that is to say , night . 
The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity , to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains . 
At dusk , every window where a candle was burning received a shot . 
The light was extinguished , sometimes the inhabitant was killed . 
Hence nothing was stirring . 
There was nothing but fright , mourning , stupor in the houses ; and in the streets , a sort of sacred horror .
