The peasant 's countenance assumed an expression of distrust ; he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet , and suddenly exclaimed , with a sort of shudder : -- `` Are you the man ? 
-- '' He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger , took three steps backwards , placed the lamp on the table , and took his gun down from the wall . 
Meanwhile , at the words , Are you the man ? 
the woman had risen , had clasped her two children in her arms , and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband , staring in terror at the stranger , with her bosom uncovered , and with frightened eyes , as she murmured in a low tone , `` Tso-maraude . '' 
-LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- Patois of the French Alps : chat de maraude , rascally marauder . 
All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one 's self . 
After having scrutinized the man for several moments , as one scrutinizes a viper , the master of the house returned to the door and said : -- `` Clear out ! '' 
`` For pity 's sake , a glass of water , '' said the man . 
`` A shot from my gun ! '' 
said the peasant .
