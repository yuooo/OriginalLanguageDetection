I beg your pardon , Mr. Mayor . '' 
Javert , as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man , who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station-house , and bade him `` leave the room , '' -- Javert , that haughty man , was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity , -- M. Madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question : -- `` And what does this man say ? ''

Indeed , Mr. Mayor , it 's a bad business . 
If he is Jean Valjean , he has his previous conviction against him . 
To climb a wall , to break a branch , to purloin apples , is a mischievous trick in a child ; for a man it is a misdemeanor ; for a convict it is a crime . 
Robbing and housebreaking -- it is all there .

It is no longer a matter of a few days in prison ; it is the galleys for life .
