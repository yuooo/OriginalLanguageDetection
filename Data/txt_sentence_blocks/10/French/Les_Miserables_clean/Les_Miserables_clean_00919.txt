WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE 'S INTELLIGENCE On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day , 1823 , a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l'Hopital in Paris . 
This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings , and he seemed to halt , by preference , at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau . 
We shall see further on that this man had , in fact , hired a chamber in that isolated quarter . 
This man , in his attire , as in all his person , realized the type of what may be called the well-bred mendicant , -- extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness . 
This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor , and for the man who is very worthy . 
He wore a very old and very well brushed round hat ; a coarse coat , worn perfectly threadbare , of an ochre yellow , a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch ; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut ; black breeches , worn gray at the knee , stockings of black worsted ; and thick shoes with copper buckles . 
He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family , returned from the emigration . 
He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age , from his perfectly white hair , his wrinkled brow , his livid lips , and his countenance , where everything breathed depression and weariness of life . 
Judging from his firm tread , from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements , he would have hardly been thought fifty . 
The wrinkles on his brow were well placed , and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively .
