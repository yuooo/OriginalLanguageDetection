A child could make him give way , and his servant scolded him . 
He was so timid that be seemed shy , he rarely went out , and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure , the Abbe Mabeuf , a good old man . 
Nevertheless , if the inhabitants of the town , or strangers , or any chance comers , curious to see his tulips , rang at his little cottage , he opened his door with a smile . 
He was the `` brigand of the Loire . '' 
Any one who had , at the same time , read military memoirs , biographies , the Moniteur , and the bulletins of the grand army , would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency , the name of Georges Pontmercy . 
When very young , this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in Saintonge 's regiment . 
The revolution broke out . 
Saintonge 's regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine ; for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy , and were only divided into brigades in 1794 . 
Pontmercy fought at Spire , at Worms , at Neustadt , at Turkheim , at Alzey , at Mayence , where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard 's rearguard . 
It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse , behind the old rampart of Andernach , and only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy 's cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis .
