Forty-three balusters can still be counted on their sockets ; the rest lie prostrate in the grass . 
Almost all bear scratches of bullets . 
One broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg . 
It was in this garden , further down than the orchard , that six light-infantry men of the 1st , having made their way thither , and being unable to escape , hunted down and caught like bears in their dens , accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies , one of which was armed with carbines . 
The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above . 
The infantry men , replying from below , six against two hundred , intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes , took a quarter of an hour to die . 
One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard , properly speaking . 
There , within the limits of those few square fathoms , fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour . 
The wall seems ready to renew the combat . 
Thirty-eight loopholes , pierced by the English at irregular heights , are there still .
