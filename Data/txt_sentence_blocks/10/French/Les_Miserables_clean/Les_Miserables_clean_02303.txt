The rubbish fell on Brujon 's bed , so that they were not heard . 
Showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges , and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar . 
Those of the prisoners who woke , pretended to fall asleep again , and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices . 
Brujon was adroit ; Guelemer was vigorous . 
Before any sound had reached the watcher , who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory , the wall had , been pierced , the chimney scaled , the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced , and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof . 
The wind and rain redoubled , the roof was slippery . 
`` What a good night to leg it ! '' 
said Brujon . 
An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall . 
At the bottom of this abyss , they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom .
