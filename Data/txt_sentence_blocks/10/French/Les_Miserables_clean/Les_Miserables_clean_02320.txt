Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air . 
The water was dripping from his hair . 
Guelemer addressed him : -- `` Are you a man , young ` un ? '' 
Gavroche shrugged his shoulders , and replied : -- `` A young ` un like me 's a man , and men like you are babes . '' 
`` The brat 's tongue 's well hung ! '' 
exclaimed Babet . 
`` The Paris brat ai n't made of straw , '' added Brujon . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
asked Gavroche . 
Montparnasse answered : -- `` Climb up that flue . ''
