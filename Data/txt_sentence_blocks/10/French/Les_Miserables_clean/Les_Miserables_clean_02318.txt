`` Only fasten the rope to the wall . '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
`` Then one of us must climb up , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` Three stories ! '' 
ejaculated Brujon . 
An ancient plaster flue , which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times , ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see Thenardier . 
This flue , then much damaged and full of cracks , has since fallen , but the marks of it are still visible . 
It was very narrow . 
`` One might get up by the help of that , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` By that flue ? ''
