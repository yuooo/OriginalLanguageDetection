`` To-morrow will be too late . '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras ? 
When will it pass ? '' 
`` To-night . 
Both the posts pass at night ; the one going as well as the one coming . '' 
`` What ! 
It will take you a day to mend this wheel ? '' 
`` A day , and a good long one . '' 
`` If you set two men to work ? ''
