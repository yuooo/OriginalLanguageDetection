he had just perceived what he was , and he was already separated from himself to such a degree , that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom , and as if he had , there before him , in flesh and blood , the hideous galley-convict , Jean Valjean , cudgel in hand , his blouse on his hips , his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back , with his resolute and gloomy visage , with his thoughts filled with abominable projects . 
Excess of unhappiness had , as we have remarked , made him in some sort a visionary . 
This , then , was in the nature of a vision . 
He actually saw that Jean Valjean , that sinister face , before him . 
He had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was , and he was horrified by him . 
His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality . 
One no longer beholds the object which one has before one , and one sees , as though apart from one 's self , the figures which one has in one 's own mind . 
Thus he contemplated himself , so to speak , face to face , and at the same time , athwart this hallucination , he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch . 
On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention , he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop . 
His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it , -- the Bishop and Jean Valjean .
