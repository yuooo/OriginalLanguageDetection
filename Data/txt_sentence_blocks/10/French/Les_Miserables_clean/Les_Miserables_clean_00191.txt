`` Nineteen years ! '' 
The Bishop sighed deeply . 
The man continued : `` I have still the whole of my money . 
In four days I have spent only twenty-five sous , which I earned by helping unload some wagons at Grasse . 
Since you are an abbe , I will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys . 
And one day I saw a bishop there . 
Monseigneur is what they call him . 
He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles . 
He is the cure who rules over the other cures , you understand .
