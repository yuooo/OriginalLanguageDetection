Brujon , of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea , was , with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor , a polished , intelligent sprig , and a thief , who had a caressing glance , and an atrocious smile . 
His glance resulted from his will , and his smile from his nature . 
His first studies in his art had been directed to roofs . 
He had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead , who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called double pickings . 
The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape , was that the roofers were re-laying and re-jointing , at that very moment , a portion of the slates on the prison . 
The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts . 
Up above there were scaffoldings and ladders ; in other words , bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty . 
The New Building , which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world , was the weak point in the prison . 
The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood , because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds . 
In spite of this antiquity , the authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners , of placing there `` the hard cases , '' as they say in prison parlance .
