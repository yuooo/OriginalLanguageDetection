It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men , as we have already pointed out , and which , on occasion , extended even to things . 
He lived without disdain . 
He was indulgent towards God 's creation . 
Every man , even the best , has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals . 
The Bishop of D -- had none of that harshness , which is peculiar to many priests , nevertheless . 
He did not go as far as the Brahmin , but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes : `` Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth ? '' 
Hideousness of aspect , deformity of instinct , troubled him not , and did not arouse his indignation . 
He was touched , almost softened by them . 
It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent , the cause , the explanation , or the excuse for them . 
He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties .
