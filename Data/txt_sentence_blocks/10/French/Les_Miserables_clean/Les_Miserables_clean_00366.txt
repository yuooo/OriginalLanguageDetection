What had taken place during those ten months ? 
It can be divined . 
After abandonment , straightened circumstances . 
Fantine had immediately lost sight of Favourite , Zephine and Dahlia ; the bond once broken on the side of the men , it was loosed between the women ; they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later , that they had been friends ; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing . 
Fantine had remained alone . 
The father of her child gone , -- alas ! 
such ruptures are irrevocable , -- she found herself absolutely isolated , minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure . 
Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew , she had neglected to keep her market open ; it was now closed to her . 
She had no resource . 
Fantine barely knew how to read , and did not know how to write ; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name ; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes , then a second , then a third .
