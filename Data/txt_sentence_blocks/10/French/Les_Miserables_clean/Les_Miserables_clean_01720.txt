Marius had just emerged from his : night was falling . 
It was the hour for his dinner ; for he had been obliged to take to dining again , alas ! 
oh , infirmities of ideal passions ! 
He had just crossed his threshold , where Ma'am Bougon was sweeping at the moment , as she uttered this memorable monologue : -- `` What is there that is cheap now ? 
Everything is dear . 
There is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble ; you can get that for nothing , the trouble of the world ! '' 
Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier , in order to reach the Rue Saint-Jacques . 
He was walking along with drooping head . 
All at once , he felt some one elbow him in the dusk ; he wheeled round , and saw two young girls clad in rags , the one tall and slim , the other a little shorter , who were passing rapidly , all out of breath , in terror , and with the appearance of fleeing ; they had been coming to meet him , had not seen him , and had jostled him as they passed . 
Through the twilight , Marius could distinguish their livid faces , their wild heads , their dishevelled hair , their hideous bonnets , their ragged petticoats , and their bare feet .
