This was the very month when the Thenardiers , after having demanded twelve francs instead of six , had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve . 
Fantine was overwhelmed . 
She could not leave the neighborhood ; she was in debt for her rent and furniture . 
Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt . 
She stammered a few supplicating words . 
The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant . 
Besides , Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman . 
Overcome with shame , even more than with despair , she quitted the shop , and returned to her room . 
So her fault was now known to every one . 
She no longer felt strong enough to say a word .
