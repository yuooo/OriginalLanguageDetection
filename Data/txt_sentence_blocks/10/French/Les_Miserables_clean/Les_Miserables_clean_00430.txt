The taste for work had really returned to her . 
She bought a looking-glass , took pleasure in surveying in it her youth , her beautiful hair , her fine teeth ; she forgot many things ; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future , and was almost happy . 
She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work -- a lingering trace of her improvident ways . 
As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care , as we have seen , not to mention her little girl . 
At first , as the reader has seen , she paid the Thenardiers promptly . 
As she only knew how to sign her name , she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer . 
She wrote often , and this was noticed . 
It began to be said in an undertone , in the women 's workroom , that Fantine `` wrote letters '' and that `` she had ways about her . '' 
There is no one for spying on people 's actions like those who are not concerned in them . 
Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall ?
