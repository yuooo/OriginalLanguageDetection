The Revolution came ; events succeeded each other with precipitation ; the parliamentary families , decimated , pursued , hunted down , were dispersed . 
M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution . 
There his wife died of a malady of the chest , from which she had long suffered . 
He had no children . 
What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel ? 
The ruin of the French society of the olden days , the fall of his own family , the tragic spectacles of ' 93 , which were , perhaps , even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance , with the magnifying powers of terror , -- did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him ? 
Was he , in the midst of these distractions , these affections which absorbed his life , suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm , by striking to his heart , a man whom public catastrophes would not shake , by striking at his existence and his fortune ? 
No one could have told : all that was known was , that when he returned from Italy he was a priest . 
In 1804 , M. Myriel was the Cure of B -- -LSB- Brignolles -RSB- . 
He was already advanced in years , and lived in a very retired manner .
