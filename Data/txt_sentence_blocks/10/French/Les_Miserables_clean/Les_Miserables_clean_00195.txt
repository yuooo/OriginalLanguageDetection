I say to you , who are passing by , that you are much more at home here than I am myself . 
Everything here is yours . 
What need have I to know your name ? 
Besides , before you told me you had one which I knew . '' 
The man opened his eyes in astonishment . 
`` Really ? 
You knew what I was called ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the Bishop , `` you are called my brother . '' 
`` Stop , Monsieur le Cure , '' exclaimed the man . 
`` I was very hungry when I entered here ; but you are so good , that I no longer know what has happened to me . ''
