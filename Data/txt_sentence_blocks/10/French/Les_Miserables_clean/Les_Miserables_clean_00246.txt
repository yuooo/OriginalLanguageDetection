This created , outdoors , alternate shadow and gleams of light , eclipses , then bright openings of the clouds ; and indoors a sort of twilight . 
This twilight , sufficient to enable a person to see his way , intermittent on account of the clouds , resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar , before which the passersby come and go . 
On arriving at the window , Jean Valjean examined it . 
It had no grating ; it opened in the garden and was fastened , according to the fashion of the country , only by a small pin . 
He opened it ; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly , he closed it again immediately . 
He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks . 
The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall , easy to climb . 
Far away , at the extremity , he perceived tops of trees , spaced at regular intervals , which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees . 
Having taken this survey , he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind , strode to his alcove , grasped his knapsack , opened it , fumbled in it , pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed , put his shoes into one of his pockets , shut the whole thing up again , threw the knapsack on his shoulders , put on his cap , drew the visor down over his eyes , felt for his cudgel , went and placed it in the angle of the window ; then returned to the bed , and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there . 
It resembled a short bar of iron , pointed like a pike at one end .
