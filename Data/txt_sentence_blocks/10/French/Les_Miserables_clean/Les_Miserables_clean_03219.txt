Chance ordained , as we have just said , that one of these shapeless clusters of masked men and women , dragged about on a vast calash , should halt on the left of the boulevard , while the wedding train halted on the right . 
The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the boulevard . 
`` Hullo ! '' 
said a masker , `` here 's a wedding . '' 
`` A sham wedding , '' retorted another . 
`` We are the genuine article . '' 
And , being too far off to accost the wedding party , and fearing also , the rebuke of the police , the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere . 
At the end of another minute , the carriage-load of maskers had their hands full , the multitude set to yelling , which is the crowd 's caress to masquerades ; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades , and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace . 
A frightful exchange of metaphors took place between the maskers and the crowd . 
In the meanwhile , two other maskers in the same carriage , a Spaniard with an enormous nose , an elderly air , and huge black moustache , and a gaunt fishwife , who was quite a young girl , masked with a loup , -LSB- 67 -RSB- had also noticed the wedding , and while their companions and the passers-by were exchanging insults , they had held a dialogue in a low voice .
