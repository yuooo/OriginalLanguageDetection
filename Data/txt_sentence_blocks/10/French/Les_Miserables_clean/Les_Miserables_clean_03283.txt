You have your own chamber here , it is close to ours , it opens on the garden ; the trouble with the clock has been attended to , the bed is made , it is all ready , you have only to take possession of it . 
Near your bed Cosette has placed a huge , old , easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to it : ` Stretch out your arms to him . ' 
A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows , every spring . 
In two months more you will have it . 
You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right . 
By night it will sing , and by day Cosette will prattle . 
Your chamber faces due South . 
Cosette will arrange your books for you , your Voyages of Captain Cook and the other , -- Vancouver 's and all your affairs . 
I believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached , I have fixed upon a corner of honor for that . 
You have conquered my grandfather , you suit him .
