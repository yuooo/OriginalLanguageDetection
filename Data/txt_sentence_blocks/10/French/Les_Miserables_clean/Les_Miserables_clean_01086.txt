The child , whose thoughts were still on the Thenardier , shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible . 
Cosette trembled and pressed close to him . 
They heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets ; the blows of their gun-stocks against the stones ; Javert 's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted , and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished . 
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant . 
Jean Valjean held his breath . 
He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette 's mouth . 
However , the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm , that this frightful uproar , close and furious as it was , did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving . 
It seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak . 
All at once , in the midst of this profound calm , a fresh sound arose ; a sound as celestial , divine , ineffable , ravishing , as the other had been horrible . 
It was a hymn which issued from the gloom , a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night ; women 's voices , but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children , -- voices which are not of the earth , and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears , and which the dying man hears already .
