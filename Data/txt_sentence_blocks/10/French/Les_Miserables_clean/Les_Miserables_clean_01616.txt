As is the case with all good-hearted people , misfortune had eradicated his bitterness . 
He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light , but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father . 
This was the mitigated translation of his first indignation . 
Moreover , he was happy at having suffered , and at suffering still . 
It was for his father 's sake . 
The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him . 
He said to himself with a sort of joy that -- it was certainly the least he could do ; that it was an expiation ; -- that , had it not been for that , he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father , and such a father ! 
that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering , and he none of it ; and that , in any case , what were his toils and his destitution compared with the colonel 's heroic life ? 
that , in short , the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him , was to be brave in the face of indigence , as the other had been valiant before the enemy ; and that that was , no doubt , what the colonel had meant to imply by the words : `` He will be worthy of it . '' 
Words which Marius continued to wear , not on his breast , since the colonel 's writing had disappeared , but in his heart .
