Marius ' eyelids did not open ; but his half-open mouth still breathed . 
Jean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more , when , all at once , he experienced an indescribable embarrassment , such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does not see . 
We have already alluded to this impression , with which everyone is familiar . 
He turned round . 
Some one was , in fact , behind him , as there had been a short while before . 
A man of lofty stature , enveloped in a long coat , with folded arms , and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible , stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjean was crouching over Marius . 
With the aid of the darkness , it seemed a sort of apparition . 
An ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight , a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon . 
Jean Valjean recognized Javert . 
The reader has divined , no doubt , that Thenardier 's pursuer was no other than Javert .
