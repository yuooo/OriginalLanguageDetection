The bearded man had on a fez , the other 's head was bare , and the snow had lodged in his hair . 
By thrusting his head over the wall , Marius could hear their remarks . 
The hairy one jogged the other man 's elbow and said : -- '' -- With the assistance of Patron-Minette , it ca n't fail . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said the bearded man . 
And the long-haired one began again : -- `` It 's as good as a warrant for each one , of five hundred balls , and the worst that can happen is five years , six years , ten years at the most ! '' 
The other replied with some hesitation , and shivering beneath his fez : -- `` That 's a real thing . 
You ca n't go against such things . '' 
`` I tell you that the affair ca n't go wrong , '' resumed the long-haired man . 
`` Father What 's - his-name 's team will be already harnessed . ''
