`` This morning you had one from the cure , this evening you shall have one from your grandfather . 
Listen to me ; I will give you a bit of advice : Adore each other . 
I do not make a pack of gyrations , I go straight to the mark , be happy . 
In all creation , only the turtle-doves are wise . 
Philosophers say : ` Moderate your joys . ' 
I say : ` Give rein to your joys . ' 
Be as much smitten with each other as fiends . 
Be in a rage about it . 
The philosophers talk stuff and nonsense . 
I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again .
