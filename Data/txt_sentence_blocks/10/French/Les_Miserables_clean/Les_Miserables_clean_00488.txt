When Javert had taken his departure , M. Madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice , like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking : -- `` I have heard you . 
I knew nothing about what you have mentioned . 
I believe that it is true , and I feel that it is true . 
I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop . 
Why did you not apply to me ? 
But here ; I will pay your debts , I will send for your child , or you shall go to her . 
You shall live here , in Paris , or where you please . 
I undertake the care of your child and yourself . 
You shall not work any longer if you do not like . 
I will give all the money you require .
