Then he closed the door violently , and the man heard him shoot two large bolts . 
A moment later , the window-shutter was closed , and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside . 
Night continued to fall . 
A cold wind from the Alps was blowing . 
By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived , in one of the gardens which bordered the street , a sort of hut , which seemed to him to be built of sods . 
He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely , and found himself in the garden . 
He approached the hut ; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture , and it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads . 
He thought without doubt , that it was , in fact , the dwelling of a road-laborer ; he was suffering from cold and hunger , but this was , at least , a shelter from the cold . 
This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night . 
He threw himself flat on his face , and crawled into the hut .
