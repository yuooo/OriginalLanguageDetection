The vessel does not halt . 
The wind blows . 
That sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue . 
It passes on . 
The man disappears , then reappears ; he plunges , he rises again to the surface ; he calls , he stretches out his arms ; he is not heard . 
The vessel , trembling under the hurricane , is wholly absorbed in its own workings ; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man ; his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves . 
He gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths . 
What a spectre is that retreating sail ! 
He gazes and gazes at it frantically . 
It retreats , it grows dim , it diminishes in size .
