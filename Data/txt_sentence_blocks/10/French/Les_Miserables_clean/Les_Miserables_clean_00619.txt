An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course towards Tinques , which is only five leagues from Arras . 
What did he do during this journey ? 
Of what was he thinking ? 
As in the morning , he watched the trees , the thatched roofs , the tilled fields pass by , and the way in which the landscape , broken at every turn of the road , vanished ; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul , and almost relieves it from thought . 
What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time ? 
To travel is to be born and to die at every instant ; perhaps , in the vaguest region of his mind , be did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence : all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us ; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled ; after a dazzling moment , an eclipse ; we look , we hasten , we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing ; each event is a turn in the road , and , all at once , we are old ; we feel a shock ; all is black ; we distinguish an obscure door ; the gloomy horse of life , which has been drawing us halts , and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows . 
Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques ; it is true that the days were still short ; he did not halt at Tinques ; as he emerged from the village , a laborer , who was mending the road with stones , raised his head and said to him : -- `` That horse is very much fatigued . '' 
The poor beast was , in fact , going at a walk . 
`` Are you going to Arras ? '' 
added the road-mender .
