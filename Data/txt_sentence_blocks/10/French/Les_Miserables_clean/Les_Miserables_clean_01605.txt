It ends by becoming bearable . 
It finally assumes a form , and adjusts itself .

This is the mode in which the existence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged : He had passed the worst straits ; the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him . 
By dint of toil , perseverance , courage , and will , he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year .

He lived on it .
