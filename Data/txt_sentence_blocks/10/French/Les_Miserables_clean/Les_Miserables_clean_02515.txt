On the side alleys of the boulevards , in the branches of the trees , on balconies , in windows , on the roofs , swarmed the heads of men , women , and children ; all eyes were filled with anxiety . 
An armed throng was passing , and a terrified throng looked on . 
The Government , on its side , was taking observations . 
It observed with its hand on its sword . 
Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the Place Louis XV . 
in their saddles , with their trumpets at their head , cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded , all in readiness to march ; in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes , the Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street ; at the Halle-aux-Vins , a squadron of dragoons ; at the Greve half of the 12th Light Infantry , the other half being at the Bastille ; the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins ; and the courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery . 
The remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks , without reckoning the regiments of the environs of Paris . 
Power being uneasy , held suspended over the menacing multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue . 
Divers reports were in circulation in the cortege . 
Legitimist tricks were hinted at ; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt , whom God had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the Empire .
