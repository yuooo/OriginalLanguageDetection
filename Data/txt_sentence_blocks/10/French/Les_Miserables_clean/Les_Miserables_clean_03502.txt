That is the way God apportions things . 
He is there on high , he sees us all , and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars . 
I am on the verge of departure , my children . 
Love each other well and always . 
There is nothing else but that in the world : love for each other . 
You will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here . 
Oh my Cosette , it is not my fault , indeed , that I have not seen thee all this time , it cut me to the heart ; I went as far as the corner of the street , I must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass , I was like a madman , I once went out without my hat . 
I no longer see clearly , my children , I had still other things to say , but never mind . 
Think a little of me . 
Come still nearer .
