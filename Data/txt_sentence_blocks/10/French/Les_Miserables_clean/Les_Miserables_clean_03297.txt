I almost doubt it . 
On the day when I gave that child in marriage , all came to an end . 
I have seen her happy , and that she is with a man whom she loves , and that there exists here a kind old man , a household of two angels , and all joys in that house , and that it was well , I said to myself : ` Enter thou not . ' 
I could have lied , it is true , have deceived you all , and remained Monsieur Fauchelevent . 
So long as it was for her , I could lie ; but now it would be for myself , and I must not . 
It was sufficient for me to hold my peace , it is true , and all would go on . 
You ask me what has forced me to speak ? 
a very odd thing ; my conscience . 
To hold my peace was very easy , however . 
I passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it ; you questioned me , and what I have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it ; well , yes , I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself , and I gave myself very good reasons , I have done what I could .
