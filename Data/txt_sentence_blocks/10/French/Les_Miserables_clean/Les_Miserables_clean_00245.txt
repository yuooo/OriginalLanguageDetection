Three o'clock struck . 
He opened his eyes again , drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture , stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack , which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove ; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed , and placed his feet on the floor , and thus found himself , almost without knowing it , seated on his bed . 
He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude , which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark , the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping . 
All of a sudden he stooped down , removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed ; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude , and became motionless once more . 
Throughout this hideous meditation , the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain ; entered , withdrew , re-entered , and in a manner oppressed him ; and then he thought , also , without knowing why , and with the mechanical persistence of revery , of a convict named Brevet , whom he had known in the galleys , and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton . 
The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind . 
He remained in this situation , and would have so remained indefinitely , even until daybreak , had not the clock struck one -- the half or quarter hour . 
It seemed to him that that stroke said to him , `` Come on ! '' 
He rose to his feet , hesitated still another moment , and listened ; all was quiet in the house ; then he walked straight ahead , with short steps , to the window , of which he caught a glimpse . 
The night was not very dark ; there was a full moon , across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind .
