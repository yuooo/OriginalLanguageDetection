The bullets rained about him . 
His aide-de-camp , Gordon , fell at his side . 
Lord Hill , pointing to a shell which had burst , said to him : `` My lord , what are your orders in case you are killed ? '' 
`` To do like me , '' replied Wellington . 
To Clinton he said laconically , `` To hold this spot to the last man . '' 
The day was evidently turning out ill . 
Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera , of Vittoria , of Salamanca : `` Boys , can retreat be thought of ? 
Think of old England ! '' 
Towards four o'clock , the English line drew back . 
Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters ; the rest had disappeared : the regiments , dislodged by the shells and the French bullets , retreated into the bottom , now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean ; a retrograde movement took place , the English front hid itself , Wellington drew back .
