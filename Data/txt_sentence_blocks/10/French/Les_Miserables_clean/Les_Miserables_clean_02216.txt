What a grand thing it is to be loved ! 
What a far grander thing it is to love ! 
The heart becomes heroic , by dint of passion . 
It is no longer composed of anything but what is pure ; it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great . 
An unworthy thought can no more germinate in it , than a nettle on a glacier . 
The serene and lofty soul , inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions , dominating the clouds and the shades of this world , its follies , its lies , its hatreds , its vanities , its miseries , inhabits the blue of heaven , and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny , as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake . 
If there did not exist some one who loved , the sun would become extinct . 
COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER As Cosette read , she gradually fell into thought . 
At the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book , the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate , -- it was his hour ; Cosette thought him hideous . 
She resumed her contemplation of the book .
