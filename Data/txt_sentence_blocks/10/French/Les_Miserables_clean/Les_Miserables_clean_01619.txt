He is firm serene , gentle , peaceful , attentive , serious , content with little , kindly ; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks : work , which makes him free ; and thought , which makes him dignified . 
This is what had happened with Marius . 
To tell the truth , he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation . 
From the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty , he had stopped , thinking it good to be poor , and retrenching time from his work to give to thought ; that is to say , he sometimes passed entire days in meditation , absorbed , engulfed , like a visionary , in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance . 
He had thus propounded the problem of his life : to toil as little as possible at material labor , in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable ; in other words , to bestow a few hours on real life , and to cast the rest to the infinite . 
As he believed that he lacked nothing , he did not perceive that contemplation , thus understood , ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness ; that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life , and that he was resting from his labors too soon . 
It was evident that , for this energetic and enthusiastic nature , this could only be a transitory state , and that , at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny , Marius would awaken . 
In the meantime , although he was a lawyer , and whatever Father Gillenormand thought about the matter , he was not practising , he was not even pettifogging . 
Meditation had turned him aside from pleading . 
To haunt attorneys , to follow the court , to hunt up cases -- what a bore !
