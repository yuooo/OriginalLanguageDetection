At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence , for true philosophers always feel lively emotions . 
Admit , compassionate man , that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need , and that it is very painful , for the sake of obtaining a little relief , to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved . 
Destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others . 
I await your presence or your offering , if you deign to make one , and I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I have the honor to be , truly magnanimous man , your very humble and very obedient servant , P. Fabantou , dramatic artist . 
After perusing these four letters , Marius did not find himself much further advanced than before . 
In the first place , not one of the signers gave his address . 
Then , they seemed to come from four different individuals , Don Alveras , Mistress Balizard , the poet Genflot , and dramatic artist Fabantou ; but the singular thing about these letters was , that all four were written by the same hand . 
What conclusion was to be drawn from this , except that they all come from the same person ? 
Moreover , and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable , the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four , the odor of tobacco was the same , and , although an attempt had been made to vary the style , the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity , and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain . 
It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery .
