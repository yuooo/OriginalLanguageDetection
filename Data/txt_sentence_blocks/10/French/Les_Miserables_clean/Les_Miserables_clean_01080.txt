The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box , the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter , and the rope itself was protected by a metal case . 
Jean Valjean , with the energy of a supreme struggle , crossed the street at one bound , entered the blind alley , broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife , and an instant later he was beside Cosette once more . 
He had a rope . 
These gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality . 
We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night . 
The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct , like the rest ; and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place . 
Nevertheless , the hour , the place , the darkness , Jean Valjean 's absorption , his singular gestures , his goings and comings , all had begun to render Cosette uneasy . 
Any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before . 
She contented herself with plucking Jean Valjean by the skirt of his coat . 
They could hear the sound of the patrol 's approach ever more and more distinctly .
