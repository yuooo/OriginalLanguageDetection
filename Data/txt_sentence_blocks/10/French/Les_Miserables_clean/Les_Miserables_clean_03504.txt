That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time , of dampness , of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds . 
The water turns it green , the air blackens it . 
It is not near any path , and people are not fond of walking in that direction , because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet . 
When there is a little sunshine , the lizards come thither . 
All around there is a quivering of weeds . 
In the spring , linnets warble in the trees . 
This stone is perfectly plain . 
In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb , and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man . 
No name is to be read there . 
Only , many years ago , a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines , which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust , and which are , to-day , probably effaced : Il dort .
