I did nothing ; I said to myself , ` The gentleman is amusing himself . ' 
I was honest with him ; I did not speak to him . 
It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back . 
Monsieur Javert , good Monsieur Inspector ! 
is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true ? 
Perhaps I did wrong to get angry . 
You know that one is not master of one 's self at the first moment . 
One gives way to vivacity ; and then , when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it ! 
I did wrong to spoil that gentleman 's hat . 
Why did he go away ?
