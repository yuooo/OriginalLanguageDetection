As soon as Enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end , the din of strife ceased in the room , and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity . 
The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless , appeared to oppress this tumult , and this young man , haughty , bloody , and charming , who alone had not a wound , who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being , seemed , by the authority of his tranquil glance , to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully . 
His beauty , at that moment augmented by his pride , was resplendent , and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed , as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded . 
It was of him , possibly , that a witness spoke afterwards , before the council of war : `` There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo . '' 
A National Guardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras , lowered his gun , saying : `` It seems to me that I am about to shoot a flower . '' 
Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras , and silently made ready their guns . 
Then a sergeant shouted : `` Take aim ! '' 
An officer intervened . 
`` Wait . '' 
And addressing Enjolras : `` Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged ? ''
