The narrow , uneven , sinuous streets , full of angles and turns , were admirably chosen ; the neighborhood of the Halles , in particular , a network of streets more intricate than a forest . 
The Society of the Friends of the People had , it was said , undertaken to direct the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye . 
A man killed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris . 
That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air . 
The insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand , and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison . 
In less than three hours , like a train of powder catching fire , the insurgents had invaded and occupied , on the right bank , the Arsenal , the Mayoralty of the Place Royale , the whole of the Marais , the Popincourt arms manufactory , la Galiote , the Chateau-d'Eau , and all the streets near the Halles ; on the left bank , the barracks of the Veterans , Sainte-Pelagie , the Place Maubert , the powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins , and all the barriers . 
At five o'clock in the evening , they were masters of the Bastille , of the Lingerie , of the Blancs-Manteaux ; their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires , and menaced the Bank , the Petits-Peres barracks , and the Post-Office . 
A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters . 
The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points ; and , as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits , and armorers ' shops hastily invaded , was , that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with gun-shots . 
About six o'clock in the evening , the Passage du Saumon became the field of battle .
