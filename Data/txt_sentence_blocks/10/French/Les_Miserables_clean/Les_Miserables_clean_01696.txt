This is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous . 
It is the grave of shadows . 
It is the cellar of the blind . 
Inferi . 
This communicates with the abyss . 
THE LOWEST DEPTHS There disinterestedness vanishes . 
The demon is vaguely outlined ; each one is for himself . 
The I in the eyes howls , seeks , fumbles , and gnaws . 
The social Ugolino is in this gulf . 
The wild spectres who roam in this grave , almost beasts , almost phantoms , are not occupied with universal progress ; they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word ; they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires .
