This woman also had a child , which she carried in her arms . 
She was carrying , in addition , a large carpet-bag , which seemed very heavy . 
This woman 's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold . 
lt was a girl , two or three years of age . 
She could have entered into competition with the two other little ones , so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned ; she wore a cap of fine linen , ribbons on her bodice , and Valenciennes lace on her cap . 
The folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white , firm , and dimpled leg . 
She was admirably rosy and healthy . 
The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks . 
Of her eyes nothing could be known , except that they must be very large , and that they had magnificent lashes . 
She was asleep .
