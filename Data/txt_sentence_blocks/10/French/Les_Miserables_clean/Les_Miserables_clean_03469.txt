Come , there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel . ' 
And the angel comes , and one sees one 's Cosette again ! 
and one sees one 's little Cosette once more ! 
Ah ! 
I was very unhappy . '' 
For a moment he could not speak , then he went on : `` I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then . 
A heart needs a bone to gnaw .

I gave myself reasons : ` They do not want you , keep in your own course , one has not the right to cling eternally . ' 
Ah !
