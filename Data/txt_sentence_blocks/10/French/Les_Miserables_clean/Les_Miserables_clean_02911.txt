`` All out ! '' 
shouted Enjolras . 
The insurgents poured out tumultuously , and , as they went , received in the back , -- may we be permitted the expression , -- this sally of Javert 's : `` We shall meet again shortly ! '' 
JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert , he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body , and the knot of which was under the table . 
After this he made him a sign to rise . 
Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed . 
Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale , as one would take a beast of burden by the breast-band , and , dragging the latter after him , emerged from the wine-shop slowly , because Javert , with his impeded limbs , could take only very short steps . 
Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand . 
In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade . 
The insurgents , all intent on the attack , which was imminent , had their backs turned to these two .
