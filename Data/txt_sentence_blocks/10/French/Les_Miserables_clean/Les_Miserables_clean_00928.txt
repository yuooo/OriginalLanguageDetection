That done , he took his bearings , and resumed his march through the forest . 
It was the man who had just met Cosette . 
As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil , he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan , depositing a burden on the ground , then taking it up and setting out again . 
He drew near , and perceived that it was a very young child , laden with an enormous bucket of water . 
Then he approached the child , and silently grasped the handle of the bucket . 
COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK Cosette , as we have said , was not frightened . 
The man accosted her . 
He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass . 
`` My child , what you are carrying is very heavy for you . '' 
Cosette raised her head and replied : -- `` Yes , sir . ''
