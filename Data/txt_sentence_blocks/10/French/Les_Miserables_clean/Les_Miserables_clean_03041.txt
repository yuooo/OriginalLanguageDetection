He walked on , raising Marius in his arms , as far above the water as he could . 
The mire now reached to his knees , and the water to his waist . 
He could no longer retreat . 
This mud , dense enough for one man , could not , obviously , uphold two . 
Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance of extricating themselves singly . 
Jean Valjean continued to advance , supporting the dying man , who was , perhaps , a corpse . 
The water came up to his arm-pits ; he felt that he was sinking ; it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now reached . 
The density , which was his support , was also an obstacle . 
He still held Marius on high , and with an unheard-of expenditure of force , he advanced still ; but he was sinking . 
He had only his head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius .
