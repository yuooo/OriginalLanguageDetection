CRAVATTE It is here that a fact falls naturally into place , which we must not omit , because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D -- was . 
After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes , who had infested the gorges of Ollioules , one of his lieutenants , Cravatte , took refuge in the mountains . 
He concealed himself for some time with his bandits , the remnant of Gaspard Bes 's troop , in the county of Nice ; then he made his way to Piedmont , and suddenly reappeared in France , in the vicinity of Barcelonette . 
He was first seen at Jauziers , then at Tuiles . 
He hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle , and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette . 
He even pushed as far as Embrun , entered the cathedral one night , and despoiled the sacristy . 
His highway robberies laid waste the country-side . 
The gendarmes were set on his track , but in vain . 
He always escaped ; sometimes he resisted by main force . 
He was a bold wretch .
