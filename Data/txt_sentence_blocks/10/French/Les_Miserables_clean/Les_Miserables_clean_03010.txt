But he did not know it . 
Every time that he encountered a branch , he felt of its angles , and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was , he did not enter but continued his route , rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley , and could only lead him further from his goal , that is to say , the outlet . 
Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated . 
At a certain moment , he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the Paris which was petrified by the uprising , where the barricades had suppressed circulation , and that he was entering beneath the living and normal Paris . 
Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder , distant but continuous . 
It was the rumbling of vehicles . 
He had been walking for about half an hour , at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind , and he had not yet thought of rest ; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius . 
The darkness was more profound than ever , but its very depth reassured him .
