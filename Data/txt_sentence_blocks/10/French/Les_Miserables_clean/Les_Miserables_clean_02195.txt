There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her . 
On the following day , at an earlier hour , towards nightfall , she was strolling in the garden . 
In the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her , she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening , as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk , and not very far from her ; but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side , and she paid no heed to it . 
Besides , she could see nothing . 
She emerged from `` the thicket '' ; she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps . 
The moon , which had just risen behind her , cast Cosette 's shadow in front of her upon this lawn , as she came out from the shrubbery . 
Cosette halted in alarm . 
Beside her shadow , the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow , which was particularly startling and terrible , a shadow which had a round hat . 
It was the shadow of a man , who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery , a few paces in the rear of Cosette . 
She stood for a moment without the power to speak , or cry , or call , or stir , or turn her head .
