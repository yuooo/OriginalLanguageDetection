replied Thenardier . 
`` Well , then , fire . '' 
Thenardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert . 
Javert , who was only three paces from him , stared intently at him and contented himself with saying : -- `` Come now , do n't fire . 
You 'll miss fire . '' 
Thenardier pulled the trigger . 
The pistol missed fire . 
`` Did n't I tell you so ! '' 
ejaculated Javert . 
Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert 's feet .
