Nothing is so stupid as to conquer ; true glory lies in convincing . 
But try to prove something ! 
If you are content with success , what mediocrity , and with conquering , what wretchedness ! 
Alas , vanity and cowardice everywhere . 
Everything obeys success , even grammar . 
Si volet usus , says Horace . 
Therefore I disdain the human race . 
Shall we descend to the party at all ? 
Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples ? 
What people , if you please ?
