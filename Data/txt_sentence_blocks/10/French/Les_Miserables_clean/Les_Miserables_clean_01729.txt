`` Of what ? '' 
said Marius . 
The truth is , however , that he had , one day , been robbed of an old pair of boots , to the great triumph of Ma'am Bougon . 
There came a second knock , as gentle as the first . 
`` Come in , '' said Marius . 
The door opened . 
`` What do you want , Ma'am Bougon ? '' 
asked Marius , without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table . 
A voice which did not belong to Ma'am Bougon replied : -- `` Excuse me , sir -- '' It was a dull , broken , hoarse , strangled voice , the voice of an old man , roughened with brandy and liquor . 
Marius turned round hastily , and beheld a young girl .
