The men who were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted : `` The dragoons ! '' 
The dragoons advanced at a walk , in silence , with their pistols in their holsters , their swords in their scabbards , their guns slung in their leather sockets , with an air of gloomy expectation . 
They halted two hundred paces from the little bridge . 
The carriage in which sat Lafayette advanced to them , their ranks opened and allowed it to pass , and then closed behind it . 
At that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched . 
The women fled in terror . 
What took place during that fatal minute ? 
No one can say . 
It is the dark moment when two clouds come together . 
Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the Arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon .
