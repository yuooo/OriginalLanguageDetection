They are mistaken . 
Their division kills production . 
Equal partition abolishes emulation ; and consequently labor . 
It is a partition made by the butcher , which kills that which it divides . 
It is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions . 
Slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it . 
The two problems require to be solved together , to be well solved . 
The two problems must be combined and made but one . 
Solve only the first of the two problems ; you will be Venice , you will be England . 
You will have , like Venice , an artificial power , or , like England , a material power ; you will be the wicked rich man .
