During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo , a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean . 
We have just stated that the Orion belonged to this fleet , and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon . 
The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd . 
It is because it is great , and the crowd loves what is great . 
A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature . 
A ship of the line is composed , at the same time , of the heaviest and the lightest of possible matter , for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance , -- solid , liquid , and fluid , -- and it must do battle with all three . 
It has eleven claws of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea , and more wings and more antennae than winged insects , to catch the wind in the clouds . 
Its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormous trumpets , and replies proudly to the thunder . 
The ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows , but the vessel has its soul , its compass , which counsels it and always shows it the north . 
In the blackest nights , its lanterns supply the place of the stars .
