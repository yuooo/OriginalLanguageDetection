This change , this sudden elevation , this mute approbation of the king , gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection . 
He bowed civilly to Colbert , who did not take his eyes off him . 
The king , when he saw they were reconciled , dismissed them . 
They left the room together . 
As soon as they were out of the cabinet , the new minister , stopping the captain , said : `` Is it possible , M. d'Artagnan , that with such an eye as yours , you did not , at the first glance , at the first impression , discover what sort of man I am ? '' 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' replied the musketeer , `` a ray of the sun in our eyes prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame . 
The man in power radiates , you know ; and since you are there , why should you continue to persecute him who had just fallen into disgrace , and fallen from such a height ? '' 
`` I , monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert ; `` oh , monsieur ! 
I would never persecute him .
