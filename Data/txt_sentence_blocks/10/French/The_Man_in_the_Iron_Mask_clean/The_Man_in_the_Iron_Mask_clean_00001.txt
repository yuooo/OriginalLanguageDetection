The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexandre Dumas : The Prisoner . 
Since Aramis 's singular transformation into a confessor of the order , Baisemeaux was no longer the same man . 
Up to that period , the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor 's estimation was that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude ; but now he felt himself an inferior , and that Aramis was his master . 
He himself lighted a lantern , summoned a turnkey , and said , returning to Aramis , `` I am at your orders , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis merely nodded his head , as much as to say , `` Very good '' ; and signed to him with his hand to lead the way . 
Baisemeaux advanced , and Aramis followed him . 
It was a calm and lovely starlit night ; the steps of three men resounded on the flags of the terraces , and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer 's girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers , as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach . 
It might have been said that the alteration effected in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners . 
The turnkey , the same who , on Aramis 's first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious , was now not only silent , but impassible . 
He held his head down , and seemed afraid to keep his ears open .
