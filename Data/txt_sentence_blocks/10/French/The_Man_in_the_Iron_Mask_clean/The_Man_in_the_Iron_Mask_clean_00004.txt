`` Very ill ? '' 
The young man gave Aramis a piercing glance , and answered , `` I thank you . '' 
After a moment 's silence , `` I have seen you before , '' he continued . 
Aramis bowed . 
Doubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold , crafty , and imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of Vannes was little reassuring to one in his situation , for he added , `` I am better . '' 
`` And so ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Why , then - being better , I have no longer the same need of a confessor , I think . '' 
`` Not even of the hair-cloth , which the note you found in your bread informed you of ? '' 
The young man started ; but before he had either assented or denied , Aramis continued , `` Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to hear an important revelation ? ''
