It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives . 
The doors , grating on their enormous hinges , opened for the passage of the baskets and trays of provisions , the abundance and the delicacy of which , as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us , was regulated by the condition in life of the prisoner . 
We understand on this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux , sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies , head cook of the royal fortress , whose trays , full-laden , were ascending the steep staircases , carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages . 
This same hour was that of M. le gouverneur 's supper also . 
He had a guest to - day , and the spit turned more heavily than usual . 
Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation .
