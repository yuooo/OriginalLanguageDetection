`` I always understood why , '' murmured D'Artagnan in the king 's ear ; `` he was jealous . '' 
`` Precisely , and his jealousy confined his wings . '' 
`` He will henceforward be a winged-serpent , '' grumbled the musketeer , with a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary . 
But Colbert , approaching him , offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear ; he appeared so good , so mild , so easy ; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble , that D'Artagnan , a connoisseur in physiognomies , was moved , and almost changed in his convictions . 
Colbert pressed his hand . 
`` That which the king has just told you , monsieur , proves how well his majesty is acquainted with men . 
The inveterate opposition I have displayed , up to this day , against abuses and not against men , proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign , for my country a great blessing . 
I have many ideas , M. d'Artagnan . 
You will see them expand in the sun of public peace ; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men , I am at least certain , monsieur , that I shall obtain their esteem . 
For their admiration , monsieur , I would give my life . ''
