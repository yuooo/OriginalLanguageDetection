Strongly impressed with this idea , he gave certain sealed orders on his route , while fresh horses were being harnessed to his carriage . 
These orders were addressed to M. d'Artagnan and to certain others whose fidelity to the king was far above suspicion . 
`` In this way , '' said Fouquet to himself , `` prisoner or not , I shall have performed the duty that I owe my honor . 
The orders will not reach them until after my return , if I should return free , and consequently they will not have been unsealed . 
I shall take them back again . 
If I am delayed ; it will be because some misfortune will have befallen me ; and in that case assistance will be sent for me as well as for the king . '' 
Prepared in this manner , the superintendent arrived at the Bastile ; he had traveled at the rate of five leagues and a half the hour . 
Every circumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the Bastile befell Fouquet . 
It was useless giving his name , equally useless his being recognized ; he could not succeed in obtaining an entrance . 
By dint of entreaties , threats , commands , he succeeded in inducing a sentinel to speak to one of the subalterns , who went and told the major .
