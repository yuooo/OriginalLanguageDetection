`` Kill them ! '' 
replied Porthos . 
`` There are sixteen , '' said Aramis , `` at least , at present . '' 
`` And well armed , '' added Porthos , with a smile of consolation . 
`` It will last about ten minutes , '' said Aramis . 
`` To work ! '' 
And with a resolute air he took up a musket , and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth . 
`` Yves , Goenne , and his son , '' continued Aramis , will pass the muskets to us . 
You , Porthos , will fire when they are close . 
We shall have brought down , at the lowest computation , eight , before the others are aware of anything - that is certain ; then all , there are five of us , will dispatch the other eight , knife in hand . ''
