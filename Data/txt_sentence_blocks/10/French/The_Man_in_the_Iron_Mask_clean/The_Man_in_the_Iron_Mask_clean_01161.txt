He broke the seal of the letter , which contained these words : `` MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN : - The king commands me to inform you that he has nominated you marechal of France , as a reward for your magnificent services , and the honor you do to his arms . 
The king is highly pleased , monsieur , with the captures you have made ; he commands you , in particular , to finish the siege you have commenced , with good fortune to you , and success for him . '' 
D'Artagnan was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye . 
He looked up to watch the progress of his troops upon the walls , still enveloped in red and black volumes of smoke . 
`` I have finished , '' replied he to the messenger ; `` the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an hour . '' 
He then resumed his reading : `` The coffret , Monsieur d'Artagnan , is my own present . 
You will not be sorry to see that , whilst you warriors are drawing the sword to defend the king , I am moving the pacific arts to ornament a present worthy of you . 
I commend myself to your friendship , monsieur le marechal , and beg you to believe in mine . 
COLBERT '' D'Artagnan , intoxicated with joy , made a sign to the messenger , who approached , with his coffret in his hands . 
But at the moment the marechal was going to look at it , a loud explosion resounded from the ramparts , and called his attention towards the city .
