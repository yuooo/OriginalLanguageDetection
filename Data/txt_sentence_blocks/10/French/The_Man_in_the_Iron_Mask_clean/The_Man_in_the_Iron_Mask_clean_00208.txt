I beseech you , then , not for love of me , for subjects should never weigh as anything in the balance which princes hold , but for love of yourself , to retain every syllable , every inflexion which , under the present most grave circumstances , will all have a sense and value as important as any every uttered in the world . '' 
`` I listen , '' replied the young prince , `` decidedly , without either eagerly seeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me . '' 
And he buried himself still deeper in the thick cushions of the carriage , trying to deprive his companion not only of the sight of him , but even of the very idea of his presence . 
Black was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the intertwining trees . 
The carriage , covered in by this prodigious roof , would not have received a particle of light , not even if a ray could have struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in the avenue . 
`` Monseigneur , '' resumed Aramis , `` you know the history of the government which to-day controls France . 
The king issued from an infancy imprisoned like yours , obscure as yours , and confined as yours ; only , instead of ending , like yourself , this slavery in a prison , this obscurity in solitude , these straightened circumstances in concealment , he was fain to bear all these miseries , humiliations , and distresses , in full daylight , under the pitiless sun of royalty ; on an elevation flooded with light , where every stain appears a blemish , every glory a stain . 
The king has suffered ; it rankles in his mind ; and he will avenge himself . 
He will be a bad king . 
I say not that he will pour out his people 's blood , like Louis XI. , or Charles IX. ; for he has no mortal injuries to avenge ; but he will devour the means and substance of his people ; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and money .
