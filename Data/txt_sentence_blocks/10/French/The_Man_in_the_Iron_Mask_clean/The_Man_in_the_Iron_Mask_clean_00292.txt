Colbert awaited the first words from the king 's lips with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of observation . 
`` Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
said the king , after a few moments ' reflection . 
`` No , sire , I do not know . '' 
`` Well , then , the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions , if it can be proved - '' `` But it is so already . '' 
`` I mean if it were to be declared and certified , M. Colbert . '' 
`` I think it will be to-morrow , if your majesty - '' `` Were we not under M. Fouquet 's roof , you were going to say , perhaps , '' replied the king , with something of nobility in his demeanor . 
`` The king is in his own palace wherever he may be - especially in houses which the royal money has constructed . '' 
`` I think , '' said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis , `` that the architect who planned this dome ought , anticipating the use it could be put to at a future opportunity , so to have contrived that it might be made to fall upon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert . ''
