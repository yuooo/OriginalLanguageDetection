replied the musketeer , opening his large , calm eyes . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet . ''

`` To arrest M. Fouquet ! '' 
he burst forth . 
`` Are you going to tell me that it is impossible ? '' 
exclaimed the king , in tones of cold , vindictive passion . 
`` I never say that anything is impossible , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the quick . 
`` Very well ; do it , then . ''
