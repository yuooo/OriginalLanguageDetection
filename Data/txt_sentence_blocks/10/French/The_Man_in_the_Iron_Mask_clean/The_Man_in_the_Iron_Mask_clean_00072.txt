See , now , when we leave the measurer 's hands , we are like those strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy . '' 
`` In truth , my dear Porthos , you possess ideas entirely original . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you see when a man is an engineer - '' `` And has fortified Belle-Isle - 't is natural , my friend . '' 
`` Well , I had an idea , which would doubtless have proved a good one , but for Mouston 's carelessness . '' 
D'Artagnan glanced at Mouston , who replied by a slight movement of his body , as if to say , `` You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this . '' 
`` I congratulated myself , then , '' resumed Porthos , `` at seeing Mouston get fat ; and I did all I could , by means of substantial feeding , to make him stout - always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth , and could then be measured in my stead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I see - that spared you both time and humiliation . ''
