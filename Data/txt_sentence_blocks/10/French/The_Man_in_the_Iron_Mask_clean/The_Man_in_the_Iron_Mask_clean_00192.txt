`` I do n't know that , monsieur , '' replied the bishop . '' 
'T is no such long time ago , dear Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` It is true . 
But with us , monsieur , it is good that the man of to-day should no longer know what the man of yesterday did . '' 
`` In any case , '' said Baisemeaux , `` the visit of the Jesuit confessor must have given happiness to this man . '' 
Aramis made no reply , but recommenced eating and drinking . 
As for Baisemeaux , no longer touching anything that was on the table , he again took up the order and examined it every way . 
This investigation , under ordinary circumstances , would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis burn with anger ; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so little , above all , when he had murmured to himself that to do so was dangerous . 
`` Are you going to release Marchiali ? '' 
he said .
