Athos read at a glance all these shades upon the visage of his faithful servant , and in the same tone he would have employed to speak to Raoul in his dream : `` Grimaud , '' said he , `` Raoul is dead . 
Is it not so ? '' 
Behind Grimaud the other servants listened breathlessly , with their eyes fixed upon the bed of their sick master . 
They heard the terrible question , and a heart-breaking silence followed . 
`` Yes , '' replied the old man , heaving the monosyllable from his chest with a hoarse , broken sigh . 
Then arose voices of lamentation , which groaned without measure , and filled with regrets and prayers the chamber where the agonized father sought with his eyes the portrait of his son . 
This was for Athos like the transition which led to his dream . 
Without uttering a cry , without shedding a tear , patient , mild , resigned as a martyr , he raised his eyes towards Heaven , in order there to see again , rising above the mountain of Gigelli , the beloved shade that was leaving him at the moment of Grimaud 's arrival . 
Without doubt , while looking towards the heavens , resuming his marvelous dream , he repassed by the same road by which the vision , at once so terrible and sweet , had led him before ; for after having gently closed his eyes , he reopened them and began to smile : he had just seen Raoul , who had smiled upon him . 
With his hands joined upon his breast , his face turned towards the window , bathed by the fresh air of night , which brought upon its wings the aroma of the flowers and the woods , Athos entered , never again to come out of it , into the contemplation of that paradise which the living never see .
