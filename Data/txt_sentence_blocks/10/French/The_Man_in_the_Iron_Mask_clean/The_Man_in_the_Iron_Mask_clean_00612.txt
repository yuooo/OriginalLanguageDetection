The fortress , encircled by a deep ditch , its only guardian , arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by terraces covered with moss . 
Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding any one to introduce them to the governor . 
They ended by making their own way into the garden . 
It was at the hottest time of the day . 
Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone . 
The heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises , to envelop all existences ; the rabbit under the broom , the fly under the leaf , slept as the wave did beneath the heavens . 
Athos saw nothing living but a soldier , upon the terrace beneath the second and third court , who was carrying a basket of provisions on his head . 
This man returned almost immediately without his basket , and disappeared in the shade of his sentry-box . 
Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one , and , after having done so , returned to dine himself . 
All at once they heard some one call out , and raising their heads , perceived in the frame of the bars of the window something of a white color , like a hand that was waved backwards and forwards - something shining , like a polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun .
