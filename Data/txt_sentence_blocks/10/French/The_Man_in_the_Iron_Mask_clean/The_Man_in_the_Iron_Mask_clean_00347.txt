This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was held at the Bastile . 
Therefore , when his first fit of anger had passed away , having remarked a barred window through which there passed a stream of light , lozenge-shaped , which must be , he knew , the bright orb of approaching day , Louis began to call out , at first gently enough , then louder and louder still ; but no one replied . 
Twenty other attempts which he made , one after another , obtained no other or better success . 
His blood began to boil within him , and mount to his head . 
His nature was such , that , accustomed to command , he trembled at the idea of disobedience . 
The prisoner broke the chair , which was too heavy for him to lift , and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the door . 
He struck so loudly , and so repeatedly , that the perspiration soon began to pour down his face . 
The sound became tremendous and continuous ; certain stifled , smothered cries replied in different directions . 
This sound produced a strange effect upon the king . 
He paused to listen ; it was the voice of the prisoners , formerly his victims , now his companions .
