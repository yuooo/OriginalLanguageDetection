`` Now , that is a word I like , '' said Porthos ; `` and seeing that you have acted entirely for yourself , it is impossible for me to blame you . 
It is natural . '' 
And upon this sublime reflection , Porthos pressed his friend 's hand cordially . 
In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul , Aramis felt his own littleness . 
It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before real superiority of heart , which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind . 
He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend . 
`` Now , '' said Porthos , `` that we have come to an explanation , now that I am perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV. , I think , my friend , it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of all this . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth . 
The king Louis XIV . 
has no longer now but one enemy : that enemy is myself , myself alone .
