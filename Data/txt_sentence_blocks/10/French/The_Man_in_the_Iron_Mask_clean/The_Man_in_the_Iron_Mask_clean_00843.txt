`` But what I can not understand , what , in spite of all the efforts of my mind , and all my reflections , I can not comprehend , and never shall comprehend , is , that instead of sending us troops , instead of sending us reinforcements of men , munitions , provisions , they leave us without boats , they leave Belle - Isle without arrivals , without help ; it is that instead of establishing with us a correspondence , whether by signals , or written or verbal communications , all relations with the shore are intercepted . 
Tell me , Aramis , answer me , or rather , before answering me , will you allow me to tell you what I have thought ? 
Will you hear what my idea is , the plan I have conceived ? '' 
The bishop raised his head . 
`` Well ! 
Aramis , '' continued Porthos , `` I have dreamed , I have imagined that an event has taken place in France . 
I dreamt of M. Fouquet all the night , of lifeless fish , of broken eggs , of chambers badly furnished , meanly kept . 
Villainous dreams , my dear D'Herblay ; very unlucky , such dreams ! '' 
`` Porthos , what is that yonder ? '' 
interrupted Aramis , rising suddenly , and pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the water .
