`` Indeed I have forgotten Heaven , '' murmured the prisoner , with emotion ; `` but why do you mention it ? 
Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of Heaven ? '' 
Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth , who possessed the resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist . 
`` Is not Heaven in everything ? ''
