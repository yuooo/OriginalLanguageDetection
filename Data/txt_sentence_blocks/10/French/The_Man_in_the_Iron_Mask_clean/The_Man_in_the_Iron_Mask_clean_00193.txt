`` What mellow , fragrant and delicious sherry this is , my dear governor . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Baisemeaux , `` I shall release the prisoner Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order , and above all , when , by interrogating him , I have satisfied myself . '' 
`` The order is sealed , and the courier is ignorant of the contents . 
What do you want to satisfy yourself about ? '' 
`` Be it so , monseigneur ; but I shall send to the ministry , and M. de Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order . '' 
`` What is the good of all that ? '' 
asked Aramis , coldly . 
`` What good ? '' 
`` Yes ; what is your object , I ask ? '' 
`` The object of never deceiving oneself , monseigneur ; nor being wanting in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers , nor infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one 's own free will . ''
