`` I am going with you , '' said the bishop . 
`` Where to ? '' 
`` To M. Fouquet ; I wish to be a witness of his delight . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Aramis , how you puzzled me just now ! '' 
said D'Artagnan again . 
`` But you understand now , I suppose ? '' 
`` Of course I understand , '' he said aloud ; but added in a low tone to himself , almost hissing the words between his teeth , `` No , no , I do not understand yet . 
But it is all the same , for here is the order for it . '' 
And then he added , `` I will lead the way , monseigneur , '' and he conducted Aramis to Fouquet 's apartments .
