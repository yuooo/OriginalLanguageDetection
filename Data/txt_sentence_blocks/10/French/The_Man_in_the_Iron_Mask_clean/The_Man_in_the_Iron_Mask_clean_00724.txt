`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? ''
