`` Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had committed , which is false , '' added Philippe . 
`` M. Fouquet rejected her offers with indignation , preferring the esteem of the king to complicity with such intriguers . 
Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M. Colbert , and as she is insatiable , and was not satisfied with having extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state , she has taken a still bolder flight , in search of surer sources of supply . 
Is that true , madame ? '' 
`` You know all , sire , '' said the queen , more uneasy than irritated . 
`` Now , '' continued Philippe , `` I have good reason to dislike this fury , who comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others . 
If Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed , and has concealed them in the shadow of its clemency , I will not permit Madame de Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate . '' 
The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother , that her son had pity on her . 
He took her hand and kissed it tenderly ; she did not feel that in that kiss , given in spite of repulsion and bitterness of the heart , there was a pardon for eight years of suffering . 
Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed themselves .
