`` Two old friends ! '' 
said the duke , shaking honest Grimaud 's shoulder after a vigorous fashion ; which was followed by another still more profound and delighted bow from Grimaud . 
`` But what is this , count , only one glass ? '' 
`` I should not think of drinking with your highness , unless your highness permitted me , '' replied Athos , with noble humility . 
`` Cordieu ! 
you were right to bring only one glass , we will both drink out of it , like two brothers in arms . 
Begin , count . '' 
`` Do me the honor , '' said Athos , gently putting back the glass . 
`` You are a charming friend , '' replied the Duc de Beaufort , who drank , and passed the goblet to his companion . 
`` But that is not all , '' continued he , `` I am still thirsty , and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man who stands here .
