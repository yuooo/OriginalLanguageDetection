's musketeers . '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that musketeer and abbe , afterwards bishop of Vannes , is your confessor now . '' 
`` I know it ; I recognized you . '' 
`` Then , monseigneur , if you know that , I must further add a fact of which you are ignorant - that if the king were to know this evening of the presence of this musketeer , this abbe , this bishop , this confessor , here - he , who has risked everything to visit you , to-morrow would behold the steely glitter of the executioner 's axe in a dungeon more gloomy , more obscure than yours . '' 
While listening to these words , delivered with emphasis , the young man had raised himself on his couch , and was now gazing more and more eagerly at Aramis . 
The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some confidence from it . 
`` Yes , '' he murmured , `` I remember perfectly . 
The woman of whom you speak came once with you , and twice afterwards with another . '' 
He hesitated . 
`` With another , who came to see you every month - is it not so , monseigneur ? ''
