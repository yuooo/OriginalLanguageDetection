`` Mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I will not give you the trouble of seeking any further ; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is , at this moment , embarking for Algiers . '' 
`` Have you seen the army ? '' 
asked several warlike fair ones . 
`` As plainly as I see you , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` And the fleet ? '' 
`` Yes , I saw everything . '' 
`` Have we any of us any friends there ? '' 
said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , coldly , but in a manner to attract attention to a question that was not without its calculated aim . 
`` Why , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes ; there were M. de la Guillotiere , M. de Manchy , M. de Bragelonne - '' La Valliere became pale . 
`` M. de Bragelonne ! ''
