The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped up . 
Porthos and Aramis , who knew their D'Artagnan , uttered a cry , and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard . 
But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand , - `` Monsieur , '' said he to the officer , in an agitated voice , `` you are a brave man . 
You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you now . '' 
`` Speak , Monsieur d'Artagnan , speak , '' replied the officer . 
`` These gentlemen we have just seen , and against whom you have orders , are my friends . '' 
`` I know they are , monsieur . '' 
`` You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions prescribe . '' 
`` I understand your reserve . '' 
`` Very well ; permit me , then , to converse with them without a witness . ''
