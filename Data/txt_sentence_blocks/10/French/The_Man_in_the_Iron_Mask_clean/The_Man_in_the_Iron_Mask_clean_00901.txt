Boats , laden with soldiers , were seen approaching ; and in three directions , for the purpose of landing at three points at once . 
`` What must be done ? '' 
said an officer of the guard . 
`` Stop them ; and if they persist , fire ! '' 
said Aramis . 
Five minutes later , the cannonade commenced . 
These were the shots that D'Artagnan had heard as he landed in France . 
But the boats were too near the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly . 
They landed , and the combat commenced hand to hand . 
`` What 's the matter , Porthos ? ''
