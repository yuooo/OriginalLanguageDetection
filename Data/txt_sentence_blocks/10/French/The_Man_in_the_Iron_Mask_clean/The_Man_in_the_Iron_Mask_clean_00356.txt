And at this reflection , D'Artagnan 's brow became clouded with perplexity . 
The musketeer had certain scruples on the matter , it must be admitted . 
To deliver up to death -LRB- for not a doubt existed that Louis hated Fouquet mortally -RRB- the man who had just shown himself so delightful and charming a host in every way , was a real insult to one 's conscience . 
`` It almost seems , '' said D'Artagnan to himself , `` that if I am not a poor , mean , miserable fellow , I should let M. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him . 
Yet , if I betray my master 's secret , I shall be a false - hearted , treacherous knave , a traitor , too , a crime provided for and punishable by military laws - so much so , indeed , that twenty times , in former days when wars were rife , I have seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing , in but a small degree , what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a great scale now . 
No , I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought to get out of this difficulty with more skill than that . 
And now , let us admit that I do possess a little readiness of invention ; it is not at all certain , though , for , after having for forty years absorbed so large a quantity , I shall be lucky if there were to be a pistole 's - worth left . '' 
D'Artagnan buried his head in his hands , tore at his mustache in sheer vexation , and added , `` What can be the reason of M. Fouquet 's disgrace ? 
There seem to be three good ones : the first , because M. Colbert does n't like him ; the second , because he wished to fall in love with Mademoiselle de la Valliere ; and lastly , because the king likes M. Colbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
Oh !
