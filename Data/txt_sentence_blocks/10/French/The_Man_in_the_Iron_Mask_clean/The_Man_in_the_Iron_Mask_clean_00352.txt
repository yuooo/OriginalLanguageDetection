`` Monsieur , '' said the king , `` be careful what you say ; it will be a very serious affair for you . '' 
The jailer placed the basket on the table , and looked at his prisoner steadily . 
`` What do you say ? '' 
he said . 
`` Desire the governor to come to me , '' added the king , in accents full of calm and dignity . 
`` Come , my boy , '' said the turnkey , `` you have always been very quiet and reasonable , but you are getting vicious , it seems , and I wish you to know it in time . 
You have broken your chair , and made a great disturbance ; that is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one of the lower dungeons . 
Promise me not to begin over again , and I will not say a word about it to the governor . '' 
`` I wish to see the governor , '' replied the king , still governing his passions . 
`` He will send you off to one of the dungeons , I tell you ; so take care . ''
