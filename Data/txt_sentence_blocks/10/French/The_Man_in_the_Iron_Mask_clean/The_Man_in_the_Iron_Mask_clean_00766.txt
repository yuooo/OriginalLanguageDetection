`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , on perceiving him , `` are you still there , monseigneur ? '' 
And that word still completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had paid him . 
The surintendant sighed deeply . 
`` Good heavens ! 
yes , monsieur , '' replied he . 
`` The arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed . '' 
`` Oh , then you know that the king has arrived ? ''
