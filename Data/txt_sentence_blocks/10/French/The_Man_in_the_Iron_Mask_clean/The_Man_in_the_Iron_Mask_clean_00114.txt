`` It would , indeed , be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince , '' continued Aramis ; `` but as the surintendant told me , ` if Percerin refuse , tell him that it will not at all lower him in my opinion , and I shall always esteem him , only - ' '' '' ` Only ? ' '' 
repeated Percerin , rather troubled . '' 
` Only , ' '' continued Aramis , '' ' I shall be compelled to say to the king , ' -- you understand , my dear Monsieur Percerin , that these are M. Fouquet 's words , - ' I shall be constrained to say to the king , `` Sire , I had intended to present your majesty with your portrait , but owing to a feeling of delicacy , slightly exaggerated perhaps , although creditable , M. Percerin opposed the project . '' ' '' 
`` Opposed ! '' 
cried the tailor , terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him ; `` I to oppose the desire , the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to please the king ! 
Oh , what a hateful word you have uttered , monseigneur . 
Oppose ! 
Oh , 't is not I who said it , Heaven have mercy on me . 
I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it ! 
Is it not true , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that I have opposed nothing ? ''
