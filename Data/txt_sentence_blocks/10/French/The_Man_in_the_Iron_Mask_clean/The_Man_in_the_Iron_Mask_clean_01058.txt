The comte walked feebly as far as the middle trees , seated himself upon a mossy bank that sloped towards a sidewalk , and there waited the return of his strength , or rather the return of night . 
Very shortly a hundred steps exhausted him . 
At length Athos refused to rise at all ; he declined all nourishment , and his terrified people , although he did not complain , although he wore a smile upon his lips , although he continued to speak with his sweet voice - his people went to Blois in search of the ancient physician of the late Monsieur , and brought him to the Comte de la Fere in such a fashion that he could see the comte without being himself seen . 
For this purpose , they placed him in a closet adjoining the chamber of the patient , and implored him not to show himself , for fear of displeasing their master , who had not asked for a physician . 
The doctor obeyed . 
Athos was a sort of model for the gentlemen of the country ; the Blaisois boasted of possessing this sacred relic of French glory . 
Athos was a great seigneur compared with such nobles as the king improvised by touching with his artificial scepter the parched-up trunks of the heraldic trees of the province . 
People respected Athos , we say , and they loved him . 
The physician could not bear to see his people weep , to see flock round him the poor of the canton , to whom Athos had so often given life and consolation by his kind words and his charities . 
He examined , therefore , from the depths of his hiding-place , the nature of that mysterious malady which bent and aged more mortally every day a man but lately so full of life and a desire to live .
