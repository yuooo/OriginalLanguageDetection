`` Oh , sire ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , extremely surprised . 
`` As for you , '' continued the king , with a kindness very uncommon to him , `` I have several pieces of good news to announce to you ; but you shall know them , my dear captain , the moment I have made my accounts all straight . 
I have said that I wish to make , and would make , your fortune ; that promise will soon become reality . '' 
`` A thousand times thanks , sire ! 
I can wait . 
But I implore you , whilst I go and practice patience , that your majesty will deign to notice those poor people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber , and come humbly to lay a petition at your feet . '' 
`` Who are they ? '' 
`` Enemies of your majesty . '' 
The king raised his head .
