`` I assure you , monseigneur , that I do not wish to abuse - '' Fouquet turned to his valet , and said , `` Leave us . '' 
When the man had left , he said to D'Artagnan , `` You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
`` A man of your superior intelligence can not have come to talk with a man like myself , at such an hour as the present , without grave motives . '' 
`` Do not interrogate me . '' 
`` On the contrary . 
What do you want with me ? '' 
`` Nothing more than the pleasure of your society . '' 
`` Come into the garden , then , '' said the superintendent suddenly , `` or into the park . '' 
`` No , '' replied the musketeer , hastily , `` no . ''
