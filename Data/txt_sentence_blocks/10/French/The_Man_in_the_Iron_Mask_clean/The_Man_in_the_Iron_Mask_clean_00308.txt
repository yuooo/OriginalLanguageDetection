Suddenly , just as Louis was on the point of holding it out to Fouquet , he perceived in his hand the paper which , as he believed , La Valliere had dropped at his feet as she hurried away . 
The still stronger magnet of love drew the young prince 's attention towards the souvenir of his idol ; and , by the brilliant light , which increased momentarily in beauty , and drew from the neighboring villages loud cheers of admiration , the king read the letter , which he supposed was a loving and tender epistle La Valliere had destined for him . 
But as he read it , a death - like pallor stole over his face , and an expression of deep-seated wrath , illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed so brightly , soaringly around the scene , produced a terrible spectacle , which every one would have shuddered at , could they only have read into his heart , now torn by the most stormy and most bitter passions . 
There was no truce for him now , influenced as he was by jealousy and mad passion . 
From the very moment when the dark truth was revealed to him , every gentler feeling seemed to disappear ; pity , kindness of consideration , the religion of hospitality , all were forgotten . 
In the bitter pang which wrung his heart , he , still too weak to hide his sufferings , was almost on the point of uttering a cry of alarm , and calling his guards to gather round him . 
This letter which Colbert had thrown down at the king 's feet , the reader has doubtlessly guessed , was the same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau , after the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Valliere 's heart . 
Fouquet saw the king 's pallor , and was far from guessing the evil ; Colbert saw the king 's anger , and rejoiced inwardly at the approach of the storm . 
Fouquet 's voice drew the young prince from his wrathful reverie . 
`` What is the matter , sire ? ''
