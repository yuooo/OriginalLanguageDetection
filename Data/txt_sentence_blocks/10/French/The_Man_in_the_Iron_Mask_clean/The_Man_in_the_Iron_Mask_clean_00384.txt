`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , will you do me a favor ? ''

`` You guard me , I remain ; you are acting in the full discharge of your duty , I suppose ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good , then ; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like ; and I infinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed to the compliment .
