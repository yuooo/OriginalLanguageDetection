`` Nothing . '' 
`` Not even your liberty ? '' 
`` What do you call liberty , monsieur ? '' 
asked the prisoner , with the tone of a man who is preparing for a struggle . 
`` I call liberty , the flowers , the air , light , the stars , the happiness of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to carry you . '' 
The young man smiled , whether in resignation or contempt , it was difficult to tell . 
`` Look , '' said he , `` I have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor 's garden ; this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath my gaze ; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their perfumes , filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it . 
Look now on these two roses ; even among roses these are beautiful , and the rose is the most beautiful of flowers . 
Why , then , do you bid me desire other flowers when I possess the loveliest of all ? '' 
Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise .
