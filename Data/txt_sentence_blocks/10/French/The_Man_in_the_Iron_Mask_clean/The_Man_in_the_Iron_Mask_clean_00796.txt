He had then time to study the direction of the road , and his position with regard to Fouquet . 
The superintendent had completely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground . 
He felt the necessity of gaining a firmer footing , and turned towards the road by the shortest secant line . 
D'Artagnan , on his part , had nothing to do but to ride straight on , concealed by the sloping shore ; so that he would cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him . 
Then the real race would begin , - then the struggle would be in earnest . 
D'Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time . 
He observed that the superintendent had relaxed into a trot , which was to say , he , too , was favoring his horse . 
But both of them were too much pressed for time to allow them to continue long at that pace . 
The white horse sprang off like an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground . 
D'Artagnan dropped his head , and his black horse broke into a gallop .
