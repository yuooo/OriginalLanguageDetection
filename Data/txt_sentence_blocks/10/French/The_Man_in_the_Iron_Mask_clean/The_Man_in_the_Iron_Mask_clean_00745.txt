Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! '
