Gourville bit his lips to check his tears , out of respect for the king . 
La Fontaine buried his face in his handkerchief , and the only signs of life he gave were the convulsive motions of his shoulders , raised by his sobs . 
The king preserved his dignity . 
His countenance was impassible . 
He even maintained the frown which appeared when D'Artagnan announced his enemies . 
He made a gesture which signified , `` Speak ; '' and he remained standing , with his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding men . 
Pelisson bowed to the ground , and La Fontaine knelt as people do in churches . 
This dismal silence , disturbed only by sighs and groans , began to excite in the king , not compassion , but impatience . 
`` Monsieur Pelisson , '' said he , in a sharp , dry tone . 
`` Monsieur Gourville , and you , Monsieur - '' and he did not name La Fontaine , `` I can not , without sensible displeasure , see you come to plead for one of the greatest criminals it is the duty of justice to punish .
