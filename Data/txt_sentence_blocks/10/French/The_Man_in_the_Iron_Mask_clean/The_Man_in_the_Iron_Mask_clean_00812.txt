`` Your majesty did not inform me . '' 
`` Monsieur , there are things that must be guessed ; and you , above all , are apt to guess them . '' 
`` I might have been able to imagine , sire ; but I do not presume to be positive . '' 
Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the monarch and his clerk . 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , with evident joy . 
D'Artagnan , pale and in evidently bad humor , cried to the king , as he entered , `` Sire , is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
said the king .
