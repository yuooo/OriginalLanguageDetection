`` A man who will prevent you consummating your crime . '' 
`` You are mad , I say . '' 
`` A man who would sooner , oh ! 
far sooner , die ; who would kill you even , rather than allow you to complete his dishonor . '' 
And Fouquet snatched up his sword , which D'Artagnan had placed at the head of his bed , and clenched it resolutely in his hand . 
Aramis frowned , and thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon . 
This movement did not escape Fouquet , who , full of nobleness and pride in his magnanimity , threw his sword to a distance from him , and approached Aramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` I would sooner die here on the spot than survive this terrible disgrace ; and if you have any pity left for me , I entreat you to take my life . '' 
Aramis remained silent and motionless . 
`` You do not reply ? ''
