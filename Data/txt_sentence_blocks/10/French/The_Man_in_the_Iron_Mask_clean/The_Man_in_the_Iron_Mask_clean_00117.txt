Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . ''
