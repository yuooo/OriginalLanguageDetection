`` Lied ! '' 
cried the young man , starting up on his couch , with such a tone in his voice , and such a lightning in his eyes , that Aramis recoiled , in spite of himself . 
`` I should say , '' returned Aramis , bowing , `` you concealed from me what you knew of your infancy . '' 
`` A man 's secrets are his own , monsieur , '' retorted the prisoner , `` and not at the mercy of the first chance-comer . '' 
`` True , '' said Aramis , bowing still lower than before , '' 't is true ; pardon me , but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer ? 
I beseech you to reply , monseigneur . '' 
This title slightly disturbed the prisoner ; but nevertheless he did not appear astonished that it was given him . 
`` I do not know you , monsieur , '' said he . 
`` Oh , but if I dared , I would take your hand and kiss it ! '' 
The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand ; but the light which beamed in his eyes faded away , and he coldly and distrustfully withdrew his hand again .
