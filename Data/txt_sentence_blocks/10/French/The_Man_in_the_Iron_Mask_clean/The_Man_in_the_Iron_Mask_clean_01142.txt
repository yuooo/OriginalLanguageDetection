said Aramis . 
`` Because the king will be beaten by sea if he has not the English with him , and that when beaten by sea , he will soon be invaded , either by the Dutch in his ports , or by the Spaniards by land . '' 
`` And Spain neutral ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` Neutral as long as the king shall prove stronger , '' rejoined D'Artagnan . 
Colbert admired that sagacity which never touched a question without enlightening it thoroughly . 
Aramis smiled , as he had long known that in diplomacy D'Artagnan acknowledged no superior . 
Colbert , who , like all proud men , dwelt upon his fantasy with a certainty of success , resumed the subject , `` Who told you , M. d'Artagnan , that the king had no navy ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I take no heed of these details , '' replied the captain .
