It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water .

The officer did not stir ; he became pale under this terrible threat , but replied with simplicity , `` Monsieur , you are wrong in acting against my orders . '' 
Porthos and Aramis , mute and trembling at the top of the parapet , cried to the musketeer , `` Good D'Artagnan , take care ! '' 
D'Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence , raised his foot with ominous calmness to mount the stair , and turned round , sword in hand , to see if the officer followed him .
