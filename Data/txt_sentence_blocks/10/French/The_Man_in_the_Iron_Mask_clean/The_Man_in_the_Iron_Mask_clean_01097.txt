He shuddered at seeing the father and son , those two departed souls , represented on earth by two silent , melancholy bodies , incapable of touching each other , however close they might be . 
`` Raoul here ! '' 
murmured he . 
`` Oh ! 
Grimaud , why did you not tell me this ? '' 
Grimaud shook his head , and made no reply ; but taking D'Artagnan by the hand , he led him to the coffin , and showed him , under the thin winding - sheet , the black wounds by which life had escaped . 
The captain turned away his eyes , and , judging it was useless to question Grimaud , who would not answer , he recollected that M. de Beaufort 's secretary had written more than he , D'Artagnan , had had the courage to read . 
Taking up the recital of the affair which had cost Raoul his life , he found these words , which ended the concluding paragraph of the letter : `` Monseigneur le duc has ordered that the body of monsieur le vicomte should be embalmed , after the manner practiced by the Arabs when they wish their dead to be carried to their native land ; and monsieur le duc has appointed relays , so that the same confidential servant who brought up the young man might take back his remains to M. le Comte de la Fere . '' 
`` And so , '' thought D'Artagnan , `` I shall follow thy funeral , my dear boy - I , already old - I , who am of no value on earth - and I shall scatter dust upon that brow I kissed but two months since . 
God has willed it to be so .
