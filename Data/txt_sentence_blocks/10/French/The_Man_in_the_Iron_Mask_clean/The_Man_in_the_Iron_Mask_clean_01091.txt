- off ! 
throw yourself off ! ' 
M. de Bragelonne was an officer much beloved in the army . 
Already had the vicomte arrived within pistol-shot of the ramparts , when a discharge was poured upon him that enshrouded him in fire and smoke . 
We lost sight of him ; the smoke dispersed ; he was on foot , upright ; his horse was killed . 
`` The vicomte was summoned to surrender by the Arabs , but he made them a negative sign with his head , and continued to march towards the palisades . 
This was a mortal imprudence . 
Nevertheless the entire army was pleased that he would not retreat , since ill-chance had led him so near . 
He marched a few paces further , and the two regiments clapped their hands . 
It was at this moment the second discharge shook the walls , and the Vicomte de Bragelonne again disappeared in the smoke ; but this time the smoke dispersed in vain ; we no longer saw him standing .
