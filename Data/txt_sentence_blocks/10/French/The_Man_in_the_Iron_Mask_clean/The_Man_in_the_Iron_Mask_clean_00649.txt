: Promises . 
Scarcely had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends , when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him . 
The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea , and which appeared so eager to gain the port , came to Sainte-Marguerite with an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers . 
On opening it , D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king : `` I should think , '' said Louis XIV. , `` you will have completed the execution of my orders , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; return , then , immediately to Paris , and join me at the Louvre . '' 
`` There is the end of my exile ! '' 
cried the musketeer with joy ; `` God be praised , I am no longer a jailer ! '' 
And he showed the letter to Athos . 
`` So , then , you must leave us ? '' 
replied the latter , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Yes , but to meet again , dear friend , seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone with M. de Beaufort , and will prefer his father going back in company with M. d'Artagnan , to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere ; will you not , Raoul ? ''
