`` You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts ? '' 
`` I do not say so , but the registry does . '' 
`` And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and the name of the person with whom it was deposited ? '' 
`` As your majesty can judge for yourself . '' 
`` Yes ; and the result is , then , that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the thirteen millions . '' 
`` That results from the accounts , certainly , sire . '' 
`` Well , and , consequently - '' `` Well , sire , in that case , inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back the thirteen millions , he must have appropriated them to his own purpose ; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little more as much expense , and make four times as great a display , as your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau , where we only spent three millions altogether , if you remember . '' 
For a blunderer , the souvenir he had evoked was a rather skillfully contrived piece of baseness ; for by the remembrance of his own fete he , for the first time , perceived its inferiority compared with that of Fouquet . 
Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him at Fontainebleau , and , as a good financier , returned it with the best possible interest . 
Having once disposed the king 's mind in this artful way , Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him .
