`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed .
