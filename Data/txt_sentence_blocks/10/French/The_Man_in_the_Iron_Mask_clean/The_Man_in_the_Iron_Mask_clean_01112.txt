He can not imagine that they had sworn his death , and that to save his life from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to Heaven . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold , '' replied the falconer ; `` it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor of the Bastile , and that the execution was ordered . '' 
`` Enough ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , pensively , and with a view of cutting short the conversation . 
`` Yes , '' said the keeper of the harriers , drawing towards them , `` M. Fouquet is now at Pignerol ; he has richly deserved it . 
He had the good fortune to be conducted there by you ; he robbed the king sufficiently . '' 
D'Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks , and said to him , `` Monsieur , if any one told me you had eaten your dogs ' meat , not only would I refuse to believe it ; but still more , if you were condemned to the lash or to jail for it , I should pity you and would not allow people to speak ill of you . 
And yet , monsieur , honest man as you may be , I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was . '' 
After having undergone this sharp rebuke , the keeper of the harriers hung his head , and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of him nearer to D'Artagnan .
