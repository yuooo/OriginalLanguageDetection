`` No , Aramis , no . 
There are certain projects which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives . '' 
`` In that case , my dear fellow , '' returned the bishop , laughing , `` the only thing now is , that the ` opportunity ' has not yet arrived . '' 
D'Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression . 
`` Oh , friendship , friendship ! '' 
he said , `` what an idle word you are ! 
Here is a man who , if I were but to ask it , would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake . '' 
`` You are right , '' said Aramis , nobly .
