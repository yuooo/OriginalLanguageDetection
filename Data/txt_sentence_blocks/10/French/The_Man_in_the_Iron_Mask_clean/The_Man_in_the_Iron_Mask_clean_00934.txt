`` Well ! 
I can not hear the dogs ; they and the fox must all be lost in this infernal cavern . '' 
`` They were too close up , '' said one of the guards , `` to have lost scent all at once . 
Besides , we should hear them from one side or another . 
They must , as Biscarrat says , be in this grotto . '' 
`` But then , '' said one of the young men , `` why do n't they give tongue ? '' 
`` It is strange ! '' 
muttered another . 
`` Well , but , '' said a fourth , `` let us go into this grotto . 
Does it happen to be forbidden we should enter it ? ''
