This kiss given , Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon the stem of a two-oared yawl , which had just been taken in tow by a chaland served by twelve galley-oars . 
Athos seated himself on the mole , stunned , deaf , abandoned . 
Every instant took from him one of the features , one of the shades of the pale face of his son . 
With his arms hanging down , his eyes fixed , his mouth open , he remained confounded with Raoul - in one same look , in one same thought , in one same stupor . 
The sea , by degrees , carried away boats and faces to that distance at which men become nothing but points , - loves , nothing but remembrances . 
Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral 's ship , he saw him lean upon the rail of the deck , and place himself in such a manner as to be always an object in the eye of his father . 
In vain the cannon thundered , in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult , responded to by immense acclamations from the shore ; in vain did the noise deafen the ear of the father , the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations . 
Raoul appeared to him to the last moment ; and the imperceptible atom , passing from black to pale , from pale to white , from white to nothing , disappeared for Athos - disappeared very long after , to all the eyes of the spectators , had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling sails . 
Towards midday , when the sun devoured space , and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of the sea , Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise , and vanish as soon as seen . 
This was the smoke of a cannon , which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the coast of France .
