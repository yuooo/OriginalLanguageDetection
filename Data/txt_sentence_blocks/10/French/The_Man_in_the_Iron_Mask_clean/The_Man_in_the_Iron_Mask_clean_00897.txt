I have money ; I have fine estates ; I have horses that I love ; I have also friends that I love : D'Artagnan , Athos , Raoul , and you . '' 
The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship . 
Aramis pressed his hand : `` We will still live many years , '' said he , `` to preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men . 
Trust yourself to me , my friend ; we have no reply from D'Artagnan , that is a good sign . 
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas . 
On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! ''
