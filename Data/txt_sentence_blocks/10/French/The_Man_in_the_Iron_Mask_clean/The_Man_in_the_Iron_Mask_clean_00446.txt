`` Ah ! '' 
repeated Porthos . 
`` Dress yourself , my friend . '' 
And he helped the giant to dress himself , and thrust his gold and diamonds into his pocket . 
Whilst he was thus engaged , a slight noise attracted his attention , and on looking up , he saw D'Artagnan watching them through the half-opened door . 
Aramis started . 
`` What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Porthos .
