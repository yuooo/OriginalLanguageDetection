Whereupon the whole court began , on all sides , to devour the dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked as though a cloud of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and growing crops . 
As soon , however , as his hunger was appeased , the king became morose and overgloomed again ; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he fancied he had previously manifested , and particularly on account of the deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan , who ate a good deal and drank but little , without allowing it to be noticed , did not lose a single opportunity , but made a great number of observations which he turned to good profit . 
When the supper was finished , the king expressed a wish not to lose the promenade . 
The park was illuminated ; the moon , too , as if she had placed herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux , silvered the trees and lake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light . 
The air was strangely soft and balmy ; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through the thickly set avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet . 
The fete was complete in every respect , for the king , having met La Valliere in one of the winding paths of the wood , was able to press her hand and say , `` I love you , '' without any one overhearing him except M. d'Artagnan , who followed , and M. Fouquet , who preceded him . 
The dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on . 
The king having requested to be shown to his room , there was immediately a movement in every direction . 
The queens passed to their own apartments , accompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes ; the king found his musketeers awaiting him on the grand flight of steps , for M. Fouquet had brought them on from Melun and had invited them to supper .
