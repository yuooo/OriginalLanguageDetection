`` Yes . '' 
`` Do you know who this lady was ? '' 
The light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner 's eyes . 
`` I am aware that she was one of the ladies of the court , '' he said . 
`` You remember that lady well , do you not ? '' 
`` Oh , my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head , '' said the young prisoner . 
`` I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five years old . 
I saw her once with you , and with the lady dressed in black . 
I have seen her twice since then with the same person . 
These four people , with my master , and old Perronnette , my jailer , and the governor of the prison , are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken , and , indeed , almost the only persons I have ever seen . ''
