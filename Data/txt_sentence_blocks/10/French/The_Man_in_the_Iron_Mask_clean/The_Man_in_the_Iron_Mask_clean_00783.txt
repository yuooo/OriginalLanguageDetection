M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . ''
