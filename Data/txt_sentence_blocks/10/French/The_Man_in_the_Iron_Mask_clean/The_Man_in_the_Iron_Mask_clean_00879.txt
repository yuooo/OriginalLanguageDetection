`` Will you come ? 
Will you follow me , Porthos ? 
The king is merciful . '' 
`` I want time for reflection , '' said Porthos . 
`` You will remain here , then ? '' 
`` Until fresh orders , '' said Aramis , with vivacity . 
`` Until we have an idea , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` and I now believe that will not be long , for I have one already . '' 
`` Let us say adieu , then , '' said Aramis ; `` but in truth , my good Porthos , you ought to go . '' 
`` No , '' said the latter , laconically . 
`` As you please , '' replied Aramis , a little wounded in his susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion .
