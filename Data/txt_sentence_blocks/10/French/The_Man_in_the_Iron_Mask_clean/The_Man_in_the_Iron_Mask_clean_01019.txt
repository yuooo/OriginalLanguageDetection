Why me , in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who for thirty years have been attached to your person , and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion - for it must be said , now that I am accused - why reduce me to see three thousand of the king 's soldiers march in battle against two men ? '' 
`` One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me ! '' 
said the king , in a hollow voice , `` and that it was no merit of theirs I was not lost . '' 
`` Sire , one would imagine you forget that I was there . '' 
`` Enough , Monsieur d'Artagnan , enough of these dominating interests which arise to keep the sun itself from my interests . 
I am founding a state in which there shall be but one master , as I promised you ; the moment is at hand for me to keep my promise . 
You wish to be , according to your tastes or private friendships , free to destroy my plans and save my enemies ? 
I will thwart you or will drop you - seek a more compliant master . 
I know full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do , and would allow himself to be dominated by you , at the risk of sending you some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest ; but I have an excellent memory , and for me , services are sacred titles to gratitude , to impunity . 
You shall only have this lesson , Monsieur d'Artagnan , as the punishment of your want of discipline , and I will not imitate my predecessors in anger , not having imitated them in favor .
