However brave the young man might be , he could not prevent a cry escaping him , which Aramis immediately suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth . 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said he , in a low voice , `` we mean you no harm , and you must know that if you have recognized us ; but , at the first word , the first groan , the first whisper , we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs . '' 
`` Yes , I recognize you , gentlemen , '' said the officer , in a low voice . 
`` But why are you here - what are you doing , here ? 
Unfortunate men ! 
I thought you were in the fort . '' 
`` And you , monsieur , you were to obtain conditions for us , I think ? '' 
`` I did all I was able , messieurs , but - '' `` But what ? '' 
`` But there are positive orders . '' 
`` To kill us ? ''
