`` If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , with a deeply impressive manner , `` one single man would have gone there , and I should have been that man - you know that right well , sire . '' 
The king was brought to a pause . 
Before that speech of his captain of the musketeers , so frankly spoken and so true , the king had nothing to offer . 
On hearing D'Artagnan , Louis remembered the D'Artagnan of former times ; him who , at the Palais Royal , held himself concealed behind the curtains of his bed , when the people of Paris , led by Cardinal de Retz , came to assure themselves of the presence of the king ; the D'Artagnan whom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage , when repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris ; the soldier who had quitted his service at Blois ; the lieutenant he had recalled to be beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power ; the man he had always found loyal , courageous , devoted . 
Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert . 
Colbert had not left the corridor where the secretaries were at work . 
He reappeared . 
`` Colbert , did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` What has it produced ? ''
