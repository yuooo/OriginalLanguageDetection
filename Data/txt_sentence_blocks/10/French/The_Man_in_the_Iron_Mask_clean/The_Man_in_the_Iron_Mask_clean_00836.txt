What I regret is certainly not the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle : what I regret , Aramis , is Pierrefonds ; Bracieux ; le Vallon ; beautiful France ! 
Here , we are not in France , my dear friend ; we are - I know not where . 
Oh ! 
I tell you , in full sincerity of soul , and your affection will excuse my frankness , but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle . 
No ; in good truth , I am not happy ! '' 
Aramis breathed a long , but stifled sigh . 
`` Dear friend , '' replied he : `` that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago . 
If you had not sent them away , we would have departed . '' '' 
` Departed ! ' 
And the orders , Aramis ? ''
