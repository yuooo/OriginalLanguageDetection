This made him change his tone , and say , with terrified politeness , `` If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le surintendant , he must go to the ante-chambers ; these are the offices , where monseigneur never comes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
very well ! 
Where are they ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan . 
`` On the other side of the court , '' said the clerk , delighted to be free . 
D'Artagnan crossed the court , and fell in with a crowd of servants . 
`` Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour , '' he was answered by a fellow carrying a vermeil dish , in which were three pheasants and twelve quails . 
`` Tell him , '' said the captain , laying hold of the servant by the end of his dish , `` that I am M. d'Artagnan , captain of his majesty 's musketeers . '' 
The fellow uttered a cry of surprise , and disappeared ; D'Artagnan following him slowly .
