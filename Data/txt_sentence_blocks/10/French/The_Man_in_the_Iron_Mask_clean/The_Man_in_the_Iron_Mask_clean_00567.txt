She had , however , time to warn the princess , who was walking towards Raoul . 
`` M. de Bragelonne , Madame , '' and at these words the princess drew back , uttering a cry in her turn . 
`` Your royal highness , '' said Montalais , with volubility , `` is kind enough to think of this lottery , and - '' The princess began to lose countenance . 
Raoul hastened his departure , without divining all , but he felt that he was in the way . 
Madame was preparing a word of transition to recover herself , when a closet opened in front of the alcove , and M. de Guiche issued , all radiant , also from that closet . 
The palest of the four , we must admit , was still Raoul . 
The princess , however , was near fainting , and was obliged to lean upon the foot of the bed for support . 
No one ventured to support her . 
This scene occupied several minutes of terrible suspense . 
But Raoul broke it .
