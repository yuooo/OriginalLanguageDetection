Athos rose first , saying , `` it is late , then ... . 
Till to-morrow . '' 
Raoul rose , and in his turn embraced his father . 
The latter held him clasped to his breast , and said , in a tremulous voice , `` In two days , you will have left me , my son - left me forever , Raoul ! '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the young man , `` I had formed a determination , that of piercing my heart with my sword ; but you would have thought that cowardly . 
I have renounced that determination , and therefore we must part . '' 
`` You leave me desolate by going , Raoul . '' 
`` Listen to me again , monsieur , I implore you . 
If I do not go , I shall die here of grief and love . 
I know how long a time I have to live thus .
