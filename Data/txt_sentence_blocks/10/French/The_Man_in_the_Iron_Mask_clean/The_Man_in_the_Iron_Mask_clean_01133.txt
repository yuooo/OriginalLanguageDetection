`` Precisely . 
If , by chance , your majesty had any intention - I am only supposing so - of asking Charles II . 
his alliance in a war - '' `` A war ? '' 
`` Yes ; well ! 
then the king 's counselors , who are in number seven - Mademoiselle Stewart , Mademoiselle Wells , Mademoiselle Gwyn , Miss Orchay , Mademoiselle Zunga , Miss Davies , and the proud Countess of Castlemaine - will represent to the king that war costs a great deal of money ; that it is better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court than to equip ships of the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich . '' 
`` And then your negotiations will fail ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
those ladies cause all negotiations to fall through which they do n't make themselves . '' 
`` Do you know the idea that has struck me , sister ? '' 
`` No ; inform me what it is . ''
