`` Yellow ! '' 
exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties . 
`` Eh ! 
do not disparage it . 
I have never seen a finer color to match with black eyes and a coral mouth . '' 
`` So much the better for M. de Bragelonne , '' said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , with persistent malice . 
`` He will make amends for his loss . 
Poor fellow ! '' 
A profound silence followed these words ; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves - treat each other more cruelly than tigers .
