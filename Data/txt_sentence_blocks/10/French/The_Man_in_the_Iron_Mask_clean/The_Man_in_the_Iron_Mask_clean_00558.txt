A lady , young , pretty , and gay , scolding an officer of the household , entered by that way , and expressed herself with much vivacity . 
The officer replied in calm but firm sentences ; it was rather a little love pet than a quarrel of courtiers , and was terminated by a kiss on the fingers of the lady . 
Suddenly , on perceiving Raoul , the lady became silent , and pushing away the officer : `` Make your escape , Malicorne , '' said she ; `` I did not think there was any one here . 
I shall curse you , if they have either heard or seen us ! '' 
Malicorne hastened away . 
The young lady advanced behind Raoul , and stretching her joyous face over him as he lay : `` Monsieur is a gallant man , '' said she , `` and no doubt - '' She here interrupted herself by uttering a cry . 
`` Raoul ! '' 
said she , blushing . 
`` Mademoiselle de Montalais ! '' 
said Raoul , paler than death .
