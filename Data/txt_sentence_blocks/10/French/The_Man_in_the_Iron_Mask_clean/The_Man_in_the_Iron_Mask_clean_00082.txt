Only you must allow yourself to be measured ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Porthos , with a sigh , '' 't is vexatious , but what would you have me do ? '' 
`` Do ? 
As others do ; as the king does . '' 
`` What ! 
do they measure the king , too ? 
does he put up with it ? '' 
`` The king is a beau , my good friend , and so are you , too , whatever you may say about it . '' 
Porthos smiled triumphantly .
