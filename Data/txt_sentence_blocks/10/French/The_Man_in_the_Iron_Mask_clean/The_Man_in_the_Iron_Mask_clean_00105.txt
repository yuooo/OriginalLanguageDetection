you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , - `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before .
