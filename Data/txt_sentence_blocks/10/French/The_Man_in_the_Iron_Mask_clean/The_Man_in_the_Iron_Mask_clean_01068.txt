`` Something , '' said Athos , `` wills that I should go no further . 
Support me , '' added he , stretching out his arms ; `` quick ! 
come closer ! 
I feel my muscles relax - I shall fall from my horse . '' 
The valet had seen the movement made by his master at the moment he received the order . 
He went up to him quickly , received the comte in his arms , and as they were not yet sufficiently distant from the house for the servants , who had remained at the door to watch their master 's departure , not to perceive the disorder in the usually regular proceeding of the comte , the valet called his comrades by gestures and voice , and all hastened to his assistance . 
Athos had gone but a few steps on his return , when he felt himself better again .
