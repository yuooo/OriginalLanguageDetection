The king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had escaped . 
`` If M. d'Herblay , '' continued Fouquet , `` had been an assassin , he had no occasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed . 
Freed from the real king , it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the false . 
And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria , he would still have been - her son . 
The usurper , as far as Monsieur d'Herblay 's conscience was concerned , was still a king of the blood of Louis XIII . 
Moreover , the conspirator , in that course , would have had security , secrecy , impunity . 
A pistol-bullet would have procured him all that . 
For the sake of Heaven , sire , grant me his forgiveness . '' 
The king , instead of being touched by the picture , so faithfully drawn in all details , of Aramis 's generosity , felt himself most painfully and cruelly humiliated . 
His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a man had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal life .
