`` Strike , Porthos ! '' 
cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis . 
Porthos breathed a heavy sigh - but he obeyed . 
The iron bar fell full and direct upon the head of Biscarrat , who was dead before he had ended his cry . 
Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds , and made ten corpses . 
The soldiers could see nothing ; they heard sighs and groans ; they stumbled over dead bodies , but as they had no conception of the cause of all this , they came forward jostling each other . 
The implacable bar , still falling , annihilated the first platoon , without a single sound to warn the second , which was quietly advancing ; only , commanded by the captain , the men had stripped a fir , growing on the shore , and , with its resinous branches twisted together , the captain had made a flambeau . 
On arriving at the compartment where Porthos , like the exterminating angel , had destroyed all he touched , the first rank drew back in terror . 
No firing had replied to that of the guards , and yet their way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies - they literally walked in blood . 
Porthos was still behind his pillar .
