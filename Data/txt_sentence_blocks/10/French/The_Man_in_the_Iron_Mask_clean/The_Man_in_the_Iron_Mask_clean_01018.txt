Mine is a rebel sword when I am required to do ill . 
It was ill to send me in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet , your majesty 's preserver , implored you to save . 
Still further , these men were my friends . 
They did not attack your majesty , they succumbed to your blind anger . 
Besides , why were they not allowed to escape ? 
What crime had they committed ? 
I admit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct . 
But why suspect me before the action ? 
Why surround me with spies ? 
Why disgrace me before the army ?
