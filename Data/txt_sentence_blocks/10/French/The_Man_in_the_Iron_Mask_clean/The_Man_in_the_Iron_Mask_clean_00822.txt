I have given him one of my brigadiers , the most stupid I could find among my musketeers , in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping . '' 
`` Are you mad , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
cried the king , crossing his arms on his breast . 
`` Do people utter such enormities , even when they have the misfortune to think them ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
sire , you can not expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet , after what he has just done for you and me . 
No , no ; if you desire that he should remain under your lock and bolt , never give him in charge to me ; however closely wired might be the cage , the bird would , in the end , take wing . '' 
`` I am surprised , '' said the king , in his sternest tone , `` you did not follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne . 
You had in him all you want - affection , gratitude . 
In my service , monsieur , you will only find a master . ''
