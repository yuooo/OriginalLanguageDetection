`` But tell me , at least , where we are going , '' said the king . 
`` Come , '' replied the former of the two men , with a kind of respect in his manner , and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be in waiting . 
The carriage was completely concealed amid the trees . 
Two horses , with their feet fettered , were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of a large oak . 
`` Get in , '' said the same man , opening the carriage-door and letting down the step . 
The king obeyed , seated himself at the back of the carriage , the padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and his guide . 
As for the giant , he cut the fastenings by which the horses were bound , harnessed them himself , and mounted on the box of the carriage , which was unoccupied . 
The carriage set off immediately at a quick trot , turned into the road to Paris , and in the forest of Senart found a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the first horses had been , and without a postilion . 
The man on the box changed the horses , and continued to follow the road towards Paris with the same rapidity , so that they entered the city about three o'clock in the morning . 
They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , and , after having called out to the sentinel , `` By the king 's order , '' the driver conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile , looking out upon the courtyard , called La Cour du Gouvernement .
