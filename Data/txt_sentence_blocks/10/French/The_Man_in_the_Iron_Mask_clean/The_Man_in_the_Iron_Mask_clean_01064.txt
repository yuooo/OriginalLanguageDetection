The doctor knew the temper of that mind ; he appreciated the strength of that body ; he reflected for the moment , told himself that words were useless , remedies absurd , and left the chateau , exhorting Athos 's servants not to quit him for a moment . 
The doctor being gone , Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at having been disturbed . 
He did not even desire that all letters that came should be brought to him directly . 
He knew very well that every distraction which should arise would be a joy , a hope , which his servants would have paid with their blood to procure him . 
Sleep had become rare . 
By intense thinking , Athos forgot himself , for a few hours at most , in a reverie most profound , more obscure than other people would have called a dream . 
The momentary repose which this forgetfulness thus gave the body , still further fatigued the soul , for Athos lived a double life during these wanderings of his understanding . 
One night , he dreamt that Raoul was dressing himself in a tent , to go upon an expedition commanded by M. de Beaufort in person . 
The young man was sad ; he clasped his cuirass slowly , and slowly he girded on his sword . 
`` What is the matter ? ''
