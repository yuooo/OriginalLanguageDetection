`` Ah , '' said he , with the courteous egotism of his rank and age , `` you are such people as a man should not see after dinner ; you are cold , stiff , and dry when I am all fire , suppleness , and wine . 
No , devil take me ! 
I should always see you fasting , vicomte , and you , comte , if you wear such a face as that , you shall see me no more . '' 
He said this , pressing the hand of Athos , who replied with a smile , `` Monseigneur , do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty of money . 
I predict that within a month you will be dry , stiff , and cold , in presence of your strong-box , and that then , having Raoul at your elbow , fasting , you will be surprised to see him gay , animated , and generous , because he will have some new crowns to offer you . '' 
`` God grant it may be so ! '' 
cried the delighted duke . 
`` Comte , stay with me ! '' 
`` No , I shall go with Raoul ; the mission with which you charge him is a troublesome and difficult one . 
Alone it would be too much for him to execute .
