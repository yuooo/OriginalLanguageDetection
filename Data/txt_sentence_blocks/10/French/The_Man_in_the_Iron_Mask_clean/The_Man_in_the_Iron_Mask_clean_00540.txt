`` And can you believe , upright and simple as you are , that if I go into Africa for this ridiculous motive , I will not endeavor to come out of it without ridicule ? 
Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me ? 
And to be spoken of , nowadays , when there are Monsieur le Prince , M. de Turenne , and many others , my contemporaries , I , admiral of France , grandson of Henry IV. , king of Paris , have I anything left but to get myself killed ? 
Cordieu ! 
I will be talked of , I tell you ; I shall be killed whether or not ; if no there , somewhere else . '' 
`` Why , monseigneur , this is mere exaggeration ; and hitherto you have shown nothing exaggerated save in bravery . '' 
`` Peste ! 
my dear friend , there is bravery in facing scurvy , dysentery , locusts , poisoned arrows , as my ancestor St. Louis did . 
Do you know those fellows still use poisoned arrows ? 
And then , you know me of old , I fancy , and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing , I perform it in grim earnest . ''
