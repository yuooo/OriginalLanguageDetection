My preceptor was in his room on the first floor , just over me . 
Suddenly I heard him exclaim , and then he called : ` Perronnette ! 
Perronnette ! ' 
It was my nurse whom he called . '' 
`` Yes , I know it , '' said Aramis . 
`` Continue , monseigneur . '' 
`` Very likely she was in the garden ; for my preceptor came hastily downstairs . 
I rose , anxious at seeing him anxious . 
He opened the garden - door , still crying out , ` Perronnette ! 
Perronnette ! '
