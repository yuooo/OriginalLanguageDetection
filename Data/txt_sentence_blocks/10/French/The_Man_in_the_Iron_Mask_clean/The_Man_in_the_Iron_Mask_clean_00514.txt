Aramis thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little rest , but that to continue would make the matter more certain . 
Twenty leagues more , performed with the same rapidity , twenty more leagues devoured , and no one , not even D'Artagnan , could overtake the enemies of the king . 
Aramis felt obliged , therefore , to inflict upon Porthos the pain of mounting on horseback again . 
They rode on till seven o'clock in the evening , and had only one post more between them and Blois . 
But here a diabolical accident alarmed Aramis greatly . 
There were no horses at the post . 
The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination his enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going further , - he who never recognized chance as a deity , who found a cause for every accident , preferred believing that the refusal of the postmaster , at such an hour , in such a country , was the consequence of an order emanating from above : an order given with a view of stopping short the king-maker in the midst of his flight . 
But at the moment he was about to fly into a passion , so as to procure either a horse or an explanation , he was struck with the recollection that the Comte de la Fere lived in the neighborhood . 
`` I am not traveling , '' said he ; `` I do not want horses for a whole stage . 
Find me two horses to go and pay a visit to a nobleman of my acquaintance who resides near this place . ''
