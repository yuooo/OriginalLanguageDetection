The captain watched the departure of the horses , horsemen , and carriage , then crossing his arms upon his swelling chest , `` When will it be my turn to depart ? '' 
said he , in an agitated voice . 
`` What is there left for man after youth , love , glory , friendship , strength , and wealth have disappeared ? 
That rock , under which sleeps Porthos , who possessed all I have named ; this moss , under which repose Athos and Raoul , who possessed much more ! '' 
He hesitated for a moment , with a dull eye ; then , drawing himself up , `` Forward ! 
still forward ! '' 
said he . 
`` When it is time , God will tell me , as he foretold the others . '' 
He touched the earth , moistened with the evening dew , with the ends of his fingers , signed himself as if he had been at the benitier in church , and retook alone - ever alone - the road to Paris .
