`` Have you thought , '' continued Fouquet , becoming animated with that strength of talent which in a few seconds originates , and matures the conception of a plan , and with that largeness of view which foresees all consequences , and embraces every result at a glance - `` have you thought that we must assemble the nobility , the clergy , and the third estate of the realm ; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign , to disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father , to sacrifice the life , the honor of a woman , Anne of Austria , the life and peace of mind and heart of another woman , Maria Theresa ; and suppose that it were all done , if we were to succeed in doing it - '' `` I do not understand you , '' continued Aramis , coldly . 
`` There is not a single syllable of sense in all you have just said . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said the superintendent , surprised , `` a man like you refuse to view the practical bearing of the case ! 
Do you confine yourself to the childish delight of a political illusion , and neglect the chances of its being carried into execution ; in other words , the reality itself , is it possible ? '' 
`` My friend , '' said Aramis , emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful familiarity , `` what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for another ? '' 
`` Heaven ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet - `` Heaven gives directions to its agent , who seizes upon the doomed victim , hurries him away , and seats the triumphant rival on the empty throne . 
But you forget that this agent is called death . 
Oh !
