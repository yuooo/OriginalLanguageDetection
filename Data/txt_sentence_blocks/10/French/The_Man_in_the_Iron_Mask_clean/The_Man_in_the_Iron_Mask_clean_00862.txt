I have deceived you , my worthy friend . '' 
`` You have deceived me ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
yes . '' 
`` Was it for my good , Aramis ? '' 
`` I thought so , Porthos ; I thought so sincerely , my friend . '' 
`` Then , '' said the honest seigneur of Bracieux , `` you have rendered me a service , and I thank you for it ; for if you had not deceived me , I might have deceived myself .
