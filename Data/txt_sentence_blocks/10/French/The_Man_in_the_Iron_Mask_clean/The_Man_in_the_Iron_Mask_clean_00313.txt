D'Artagnan turned on his heel , and made his way towards the door ; it was but a short distance , and he cleared it in half a dozen paces ; when he reached it he suddenly paused , and said , `` Your majesty will forgive me , but , in order to effect this arrest , I should like written directions . '' 
`` For what purpose - and since when has the king 's word been insufficient for you ? '' 
`` Because the word of a king , when it springs from a feeling of anger , may possibly change when the feeling changes . '' 
`` A truce to set phrases , monsieur ; you have another thought besides that ? '' 
`` Oh , I , at least , have certain thoughts and ideas , which , unfortunately , others have not , '' D'Artagnan replied , impertinently . 
The king , in the tempest of his wrath , hesitated , and drew back in the face of D'Artagnan 's frank courage , just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider . 
`` What is your thought ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan : `` you cause a man to be arrested when you are still under his roof ; and passion is alone the cause of that . 
When your anger shall have passed , you will regret what you have done ; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature .
