`` Ah ! 
I have nothing to say in that respect . '' 
`` One moment , monseigneur : let me tell you how I should have behaved towards any one but yourself . 
It might be that I happened to arrive at your door just as your guests or your friends had left you - or , if they had not gone yet , I should wait until they were leaving , and should then catch them one after the other , like rabbits ; I should lock them up quietly enough , I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor , and with one hand upon you , before you suspected the slightest thing amiss , I should keep you safely until my master 's breakfast in the morning . 
In this way , I should just the same have avoided all publicity , all disturbance , all opposition ; but there would also have been no warning for M. Fouquet , no consideration for his feelings , none of those delicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially courteous in their natures , whenever the decisive moment may arrive . 
Are you satisfied with the plan ? '' 
`` It makes me shudder . '' 
`` I thought you would not like it . 
It would have been very disagreeable to have made my appearance to-morrow , without any preparation , and to have asked you to deliver up your sword . '' 
`` Oh !
