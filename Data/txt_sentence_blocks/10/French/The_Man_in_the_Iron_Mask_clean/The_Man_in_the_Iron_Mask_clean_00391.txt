This sweat - bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe , as the gore of Abel frightened Cain . 
`` I am face to face with my destiny , '' said Philippe , his eyes on fire , and his face a livid white . 
`` Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy ? 
Though I am compelled to follow out , at every moment , the sovereign power and authority I have usurped , shall I cease to listen to the scruples of my heart ? 
Yes ! 
the king has lain on this bed ; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this pillow ; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief : and yet , I hesitate to throw myself on the bed , or to press in my hand the handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother 's arms . 
Away with such weakness ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , who asserts that a man 's action should be always one degree above his thoughts ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , whose thoughts are of and for himself alone , who regards himself as a man of honor , so long as he injures or betrays his enemies only . 
I , I alone , should have occupied this bed , if Louis XIV . 
had not , owing to my mother 's criminal abandonment , stood in my way ; and this handkerchief , embroidered with the arms of France , would in right and justice belong to me alone , if , as M. d'Herblay observes , I had been left my royal cradle . 
Philippe , son of France , take your place on that bed ; Philippe , sole king of France , resume the blazonry that is yours !
