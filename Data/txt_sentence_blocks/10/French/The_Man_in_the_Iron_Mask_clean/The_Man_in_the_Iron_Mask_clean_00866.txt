`` Aramis ! '' 
`` No , no , Porthos , I conjure you , let me act . 
No false generosity ! 
No inopportune devotedness ! 
You knew nothing of my projects . 
You have done nothing of yourself . 
With me it is different . 
I alone am the author of this plot . 
I stood in need of my inseparable companion ; I called upon you , and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device , ` All for one , one for all . ' 
My crime is that I was an egotist . ''
