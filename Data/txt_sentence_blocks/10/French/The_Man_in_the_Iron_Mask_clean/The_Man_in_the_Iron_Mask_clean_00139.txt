`` Well , if they are in your head you can not burn them . '' 
`` True , '' said La Fontaine ; `` but if I do not burn them - '' `` Well , what will happen if you do not burn them ? '' 
`` They will remain in my mind , and I shall never forget them ! '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
cried Loret ; `` what a dangerous thing ! 
One would go mad with it ! '' 
`` The deuce ! 
the deuce ! '' 
repeated La Fontaine ; `` what can I do ? '' 
`` I have discovered the way , '' said Moliere , who had entered just at this point of the conversation .
