The officers looked at each other as if to read each other 's opinions in their eyes , with the intention of evidently acting , should they agree , according to the desire of D'Artagnan . 
And already the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos and Aramis , when the king 's officer drew from a pocket a folded paper , which he placed in the hands of D'Artagnan . 
This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1 . 
`` What , more ! '' 
murmured the surprised captain . 
`` Read , monsieur , '' said the officer , with a courtesy that was not free from sadness . 
D'Artagnan , full of mistrust , unfolded the paper , and read these words : `` Prohibition to M. d'Artagnan to assemble any council whatever , or to deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners shot . 
Signed - LOUIS . '' 
D'Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole body , and with a gracious smile : `` That is well , monsieur , '' said he ; `` the king 's orders shall be complied with . '' 
: Result of the Ideas of the King , and the Ideas of D'Artagnan .
