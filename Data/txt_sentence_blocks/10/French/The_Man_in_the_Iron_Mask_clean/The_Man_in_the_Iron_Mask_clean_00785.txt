You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . ''
