The half-closed shutters only admitted the entrance of an uncertain light passing through thick violet velvet curtains lined with silk . 
In this soft shade , the eyes were by degrees dilated , and every one present saw others rather with imagination than with actual sight . 
There could not , however , escape , in these circumstances , one of the surrounding details ; and the new object which presented itself appeared as luminous as though it shone out in full sunlight . 
So it happened with Louis XIV. , when he showed himself , pale and frowning , in the doorway of the secret stairs . 
The face of Fouquet appeared behind him , stamped with sorrow and determination . 
The queen - mother , who perceived Louis XIV. , and who held the hand of Philippe , uttered a cry of which we have spoken , as if she beheld a phantom . 
Monsieur was bewildered , and kept turning his head in astonishment from one to the other . 
Madame made a step forward , thinking she was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror . 
And , in fact , the illusion was possible . 
The two princes , both pale as death - for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful state of Philippe - trembling , clenching their hands convulsively , measured each other with looks , and darted their glances , sharp as poniards , at each other .
