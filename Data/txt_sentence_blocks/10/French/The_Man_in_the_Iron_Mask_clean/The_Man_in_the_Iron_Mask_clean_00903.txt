`` Here is a prisoner for you , '' said Porthos coolly to Aramis .

`` From which it results , then , '' said Porthos , `` that what we have done is of not the slightest use . '' 
`` For the moment it may be , '' replied the bishop , `` for we have a prisoner from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do . ''
