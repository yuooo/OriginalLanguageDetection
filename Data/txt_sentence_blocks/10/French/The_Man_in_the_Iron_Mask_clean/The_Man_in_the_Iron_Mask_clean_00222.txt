Accept it , as I offer it you - sincerely , cheerfully . 
Forthwith , without a moment 's pause , I will unharness two of my horses , which are attached to the carriage yonder , and they , accompanied by my servant - my deaf and dumb attendant - shall conduct you - traveling throughout the night , sleeping during the day - to the locality I have described ; and I shall , at least , have the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince the major service he himself preferred . 
I shall have made one human being happy ; and Heaven for that will hold me in better account than if I had made one man powerful ; the former task is far more difficult . 
And now , monseigneur , your answer to this proposition ? 
Here is the money . 
Nay , do not hesitate . 
At Poitou , you can risk nothing , except the chance of catching the fevers prevalent there ; and even of them , the so-called wizards of the country will cure you , for the sake of your pistoles . 
If you play the other game , you run the chance of being assassinated on a throne , strangled in a prison-cell . 
Upon my soul , I assure you , now I begin to compare them together , I myself should hesitate which lot I should accept . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the young prince , `` before I determine , let me alight from this carriage , walk on the ground , and consult that still voice within me , which Heaven bids us all to hearken to .
