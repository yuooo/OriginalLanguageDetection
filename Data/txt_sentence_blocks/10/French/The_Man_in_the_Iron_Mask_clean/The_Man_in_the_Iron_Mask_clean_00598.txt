`` I hope not , monseigneur . ''

Athos interrupted the prince . 
`` Keep your money , monseigneur ; war is to be waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead . '' 
`` I wish to try the contrary , '' replied the duke ; `` and then you are acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition - plenty of noise , plenty of fire , and , if so it must be , I shall disappear in the smoke . ''

He perceived this at once .
