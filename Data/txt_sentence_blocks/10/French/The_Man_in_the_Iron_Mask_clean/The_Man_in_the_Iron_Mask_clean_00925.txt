Dawn just tinted with purple and white the waves and plain ; through the dim light , melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles , and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering fields of buckwheat . 
In a quarter of an hour it would be clear daylight ; the wakened birds announced it to all nature . 
The barkings which had been heard , which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat , and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern , now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league of the grotto . 
`` It is a pack of hounds , '' said Porthos ; `` the dogs are on a scent . '' 
`` Who can be hunting at such a moment as this ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` And this way , particularly , '' continued Porthos , `` where they might expect the army of the royalists . '' 
`` The noise comes nearer . 
Yes , you are right , Porthos , the dogs are on a scent . 
But , Yves ! ''
