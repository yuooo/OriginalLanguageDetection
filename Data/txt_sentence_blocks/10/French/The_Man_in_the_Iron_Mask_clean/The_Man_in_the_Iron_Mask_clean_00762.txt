`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment .
