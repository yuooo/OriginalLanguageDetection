These people arrived before the place which D'Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak , and presented themselves at the lodgings of the general . 
They were told that M. d'Artagnan , annoyed by a sortie which the governor , an artful man , had made the evening before , and in which the works had been destroyed and seventy-seven men killed , and the reparation of the breaches commenced , had just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to reconstruct the works . 
M. Colbert 's envoy had orders to go and seek M. d'Artagnan , wherever he might be , or at whatever hour of the day or night . 
He directed his course , therefore , towards the trenches , followed by his escort , all on horseback . 
They perceived M. d'Artagnan in the open plain , with his gold - laced hat , his long cane , and gilt cuffs . 
He was biting his white mustache , and wiping off , with his left hand , the dust which the passing balls threw up from the ground they plowed so near him . 
They also saw , amidst this terrible fire , which filled the air with whistling hisses , officers handling the shovel , soldiers rolling barrows , and vast fascines , rising by being either carried or dragged by from ten to twenty men , cover the front of the trench reopened to the center by this extraordinary effort of the general . 
In three hours , all was reinstated . 
D'Artagnan began to speak more mildly ; and he became quite calm when the captain of the pioneers approached him , hat in hand , to tell him that the trench was again in proper order . 
This man had scarcely finished speaking , when a ball took off one of his legs , and he fell into the arms of D'Artagnan .
