: The Angel of Death . 
Athos was at this part of his marvelous vision , when the charm was suddenly broken by a great noise rising from the outer gates . 
A horse was heard galloping over the hard gravel of the great alley , and the sound of noisy and animated conversations ascended to the chamber in which the comte was dreaming . 
Athos did not stir from the place he occupied ; he scarcely turned his head towards the door to ascertain the sooner what these noises could be . 
A heavy step ascended the stairs ; the horse , which had recently galloped , departed slowly towards the stables . 
Great hesitation appeared in the steps , which by degrees approached the chamber . 
A door was opened , and Athos , turning a little towards the part of the room the noise came from , cried , in a weak voice : `` It is a courier from Africa , is it not ? '' 
`` No , monsieur le comte , '' replied a voice which made the father of Raoul start upright in his bed . 
`` Grimaud ! '' 
murmured he .
