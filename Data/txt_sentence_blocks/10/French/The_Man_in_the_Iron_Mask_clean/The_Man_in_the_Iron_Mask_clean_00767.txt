`` Yes , monsieur , I have seen him ; and this time you come from him - '' `` To inquire after you , monseigneur ; and , if your health is not too bad , to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle . '' 
`` Directly , Monsieur d'Artagnan , directly ! '' 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
said the captain , `` now the king is come , there is no more walking for anybody - no more free will ; the password governs all now , you as much as me , me as much as you . '' 
Fouquet heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage , so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by D'Artagnan , whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . 
: How the King , Louis XIV. , Played His Little Part . 
As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of Nantes , a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect , and gave him a letter . 
D'Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet , and pushed him away , but the message had been given to the surintendant . 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it , and instantly a vague terror , which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate , was painted on the countenance of the first minister . 
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm , and passed on towards the king 's apartments .
