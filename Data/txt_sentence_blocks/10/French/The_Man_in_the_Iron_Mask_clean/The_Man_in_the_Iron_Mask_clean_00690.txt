`` And of monsieur le surintendant ? '' 
`` Without doubt . '' 
`` Very well , sire . 
By to-morrow I shall have set out . '' 
`` Oh , yes ; but one more word , Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
At Nantes you will meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres , captain of the guards . 
Be sure that your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive . 
Precedence always belongs to the first comer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . ''
