At that moment the drums suddenly rolled , and the clarions filled the air with their inspiring notes . 
The regiments destined for the expedition began to debouch from the city . 
They advanced to the number of five , each composed of forty companies . 
Royals marched first , distinguished by their white uniform , faced with blue . 
The ordonnance colors , quartered cross-wise , violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs-de - lis , left the white-colored flag , with its fleur-de-lised cross , to dominate the whole . 
Musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders ; pikemen in the center , with their lances , fourteen feet in length , marched gayly towards the transports , which carried them in detail to the ships . 
The regiments of Picardy , Navarre , Normandy , and Royal Vaisseau , followed after . 
M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops . 
He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would take a full hour before he could reach the sea . 
Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach , in order to take his place when the prince embarked .
