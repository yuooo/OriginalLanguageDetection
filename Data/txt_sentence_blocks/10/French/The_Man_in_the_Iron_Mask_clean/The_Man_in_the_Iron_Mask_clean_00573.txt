Madame has been long jealous of the king . '' 
`` I know she has - '' `` Oh ! 
fear nothing - you are beloved - you are beloved , count ; do you feel the value of these three words ? 
They signify that you can raise your head , that you can sleep tranquilly , that you can thank God every minute of you life . 
You are beloved ; that signifies that you may hear everything , even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your happiness . 
You are beloved , De Guiche , you are beloved ! 
You do not endure those atrocious nights , those nights without end , which , with arid eye and fainting heart , others pass through who are destined to die . 
You will live long , if you act like the miser who , bit by bit , crumb by crumb , collects and heaps up diamonds and gold . 
You are beloved ! 
- allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever . ''
