Every word that fell from Fouquet 's lips , and which he thought most efficacious in procuring his friend 's pardon , seemed to pour another drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV . 
Nothing could bend or soften him . 
Addressing himself to Fouquet , he said , `` I really do n't know , monsieur , why you should solicit the pardon of these men . 
What good is there in asking that which can be obtained without solicitation ? '' 
`` I do not understand you , sire . '' 
`` It is not difficult , either . 
Where am I now ? '' 
`` In the Bastile , sire . '' 
`` Yes ; in a dungeon . 
I am looked upon as a madman , am I not ? ''
