asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically .
