`` What do you think of it ? '' 
at length said Aramis . 
`` I think that I am lost , '' replied the captive ; `` the king will never set me free . '' 
`` And I - I demand to know , '' added the bishop , fixing his piercing eyes significantly upon the prisoner , `` I demand to know which of these two is king ; the one this miniature portrays , or whom the glass reflects ? '' 
`` The king , monsieur , '' sadly replied the young man , `` is he who is on the throne , who is not in prison ; and who , on the other hand , can cause others to be entombed there . 
Royalty means power ; and you behold how powerless I am . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' answered Aramis , with a respect he had not yet manifested , `` the king , mark me , will , if you desire it , be the one that , quitting his dungeon , shall maintain himself upon the throne , on which his friends will place him . '' 
`` Tempt me not , monsieur , '' broke in the prisoner bitterly . 
`` Be not weak , monseigneur , '' persisted Aramis ; `` I have brought you all the proofs of your birth ; consult them ; satisfy yourself that you are a king 's son ; it is for us to act . '' 
`` No , no ; it is impossible . ''
