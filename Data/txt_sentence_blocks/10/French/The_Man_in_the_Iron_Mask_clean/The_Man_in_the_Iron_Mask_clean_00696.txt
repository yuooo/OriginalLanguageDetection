Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . '' 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness , which filled the hearts of all his friends with terror . 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast . 
`` Ah ! 
then , '' said he , `` perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes ? '' 
`` I do not know whither I am setting out , monseigneur . '' 
`` But , '' said Madame Fouquet , recovered from her fright , `` you are not going so soon , monsieur le capitaine , as not to do us the honor to take a seat with us ? '' 
`` Madame , I should esteem that a great honor done me , but I am so pressed for time , that , you see , I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note . ''
