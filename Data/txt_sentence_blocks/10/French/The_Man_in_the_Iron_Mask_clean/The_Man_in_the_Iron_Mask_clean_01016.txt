`` Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty 's army ! 
That is incredible . '' 
`` You have no power to judge of my will . '' 
`` But I have to judge of my own friendships , sire . '' 
`` He who serves his friends does not serve his master . '' 
`` I so well understand this , sire , that I have respectfully offered your majesty my resignation . '' 
`` And I have accepted it , monsieur , '' said the king . 
`` Before being separated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep my word . '' 
`` Your majesty has kept more than your word , for your majesty has had me arrested , '' said D'Artagnan , with his cold , bantering air ; `` you did not promise me that , sire . '' 
The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry , and continued , seriously , `` You see , monsieur , to what grave steps your disobedience forces me . ''
