Great they will be , I feel - but , if by chance I should not think them so ? 
I have seen war , sire , I have seen peace ; I have served Richelieu and Mazarin ; I have been scorched with your father , at the fire of Rochelle ; riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve , having grown a new skin ten times , as serpents do . 
After affronts and injustices , I have a command which was formerly something , because it gave the bearer the right of speaking as he liked to his king . 
But your captain of the musketeers will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors . 
Truly , sire , if that is to be my employment from this time , seize the opportunity of our being on good terms , to take it from me . 
Do not imagine that I bear malice ; no , you have tamed me , as you say ; but it must be confessed that in taming me you have lowered me ; by bowing me you have convicted me of weakness . 
If you knew how well it suits me to carry my head high , and what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your carpets ! 
Oh ! 
sire , I regret sincerely , and you will regret as I do , the old days when the king of France saw in every vestibule those insolent gentlemen , lean , always swearing - cross-grained mastiffs , who could bite mortally in the hour of danger or of battle . 
These men were the best of courtiers to the hand which fed them - they would lick it ; but for the hand that struck them , oh !
