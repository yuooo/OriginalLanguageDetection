Every morning I went through military exercises , and practiced on horseback . 
Well , one morning during the summer , it being very hot , I went to sleep in the hall . 
Nothing , up to that period , except the respect paid me , had enlightened me , or even roused my suspicions . 
I lived as children , as birds , as plants , as the air and the sun do . 
I had just turned my fifteenth year - '' `` This , then , is eight years ago ? '' 
`` Yes , nearly ; but I have ceased to reckon time . '' 
`` Excuse me ; but what did your tutor tell you , to encourage you to work ? '' 
`` He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself , in the world , that fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth . 
He added that , being a poor , obscure orphan , I had no one but myself to look to ; and that nobody either did , or ever would , take any interest in me . 
I was , then , in the hall I have spoken of , asleep from fatigue with long fencing .
