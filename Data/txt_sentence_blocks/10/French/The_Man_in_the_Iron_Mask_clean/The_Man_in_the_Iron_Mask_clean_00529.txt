said Athos , with a discreet air . 
`` Much ; and at the service of my friends . '' 
These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand . 
`` Thank you , '' replied the comte . 
`` And while we are on this head , '' said Aramis , `` you also are a malcontent ; you also , Raoul , have griefs to lay to the king .

Then we shall see , I guarantee upon my honor , that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the subject of this son of Louis XIII. , who is an Infante likewise , and whom France detains inhumanly . 
Now , as Louis XIV . 
would have no inclination for a war on that subject , I will answer for an arrangement , the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me , and a duchy in France to you , who are already a grandee of Spain .
