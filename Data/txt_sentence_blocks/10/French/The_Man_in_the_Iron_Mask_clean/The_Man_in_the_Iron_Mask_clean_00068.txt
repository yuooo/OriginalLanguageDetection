`` What ! 
you stouter ! '' 
`` So much so that I am now bigger than the baron . 
Would you believe it , monsieur ? '' 
`` Parbleu !

`` Do you see , stupid ? '' 
said Porthos , `` that is quite evident ! '' 
`` Be still , my dear Porthos , '' resumed D'Artagnan , becoming slightly impatient , `` I do n't understand why your clothes should not fit you , because Mouston has grown stouter . ''
