The rowers of Fouquet 's boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` The matter is , monseigneur , '' replied the patron of the bark , `` that it is a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane . '' 
Gourville started , and mounted to the deck , in order to obtain a better view . 
Fouquet did not go up with him , but said to Gourville , with restrained mistrust : `` See what it is , dear friend . '' 
The lighter had just passed the elbow . 
It came on so fast , that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day .
