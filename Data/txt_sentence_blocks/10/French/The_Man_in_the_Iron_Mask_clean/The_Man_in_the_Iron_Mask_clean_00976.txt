`` Quick ! 
quick ! '' 
repeated Aramis , bending forward towards the shore , as if to draw Porthos towards him with his arms . 
`` Here I am , '' stammered Porthos , collecting all his strength to make one step more . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
Porthos , make haste ! 
the barrel will blow up ! '' 
`` Make haste , monseigneur ! '' 
shouted the Bretons to Porthos , who was floundering as in a dream .
