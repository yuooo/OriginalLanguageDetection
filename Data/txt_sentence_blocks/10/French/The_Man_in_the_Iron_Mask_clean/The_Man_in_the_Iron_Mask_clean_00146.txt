`` Four times as many as ` La Pucelle , ' which M. Chaplain is meditating . 
Is it also on this subject , too , that you have composed a hundred thousand verses ? '' 
`` Listen to me , you eternally absent-minded creature , '' said Moliere . 
`` It is certain , '' continued La Fontaine , `` that legume , for instance , rhymes with posthume . '' 
`` In the plural , above all . '' 
`` Yes , above all in the plural , seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters , but with four ; as orniere does with lumiere . '' 
`` But give me ornieres and lumieres in the plural , my dear Pelisson , '' said La Fontaine , clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend , whose insult he had quite forgotten , `` and they will rhyme . '' 
`` Hem ! '' 
coughed Pelisson . 
`` Moliere says so , and Moliere is a judge of such things ; he declares he has himself made a hundred thousand verses . ''
