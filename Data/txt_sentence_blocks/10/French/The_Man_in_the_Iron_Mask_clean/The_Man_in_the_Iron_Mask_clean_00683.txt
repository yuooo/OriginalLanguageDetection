- that 's all very well , '' said Athenais , `` but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach herself with . 
The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars ; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with . '' 
Louise pressed her hand over her icy brow . 
`` And if he dies , '' continued her pitiless tormentor , `` you will have killed him . 
That is the sin . '' 
Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? '' 
D'Artagnan made several steps along the gallery , holding Louise on his arm ; then , when they were far enough removed from the others - `` What I had to say to you , mademoiselle , '' replied he , `` Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente has just expressed ; roughly and unkindly , it is true but still in its entirety . '' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die .
