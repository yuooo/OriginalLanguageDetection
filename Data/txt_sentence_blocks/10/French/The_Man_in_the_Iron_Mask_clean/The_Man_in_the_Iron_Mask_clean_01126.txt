That evening D'Artagnan was seated at the king 's table , near M. Colbert and M. le Duc d'Almeda . 
The king was very gay . 
He paid a thousand little attentions to the queen , a thousand kindnesses to Madame , seated at his left hand , and very sad . 
It might have been supposed that time of calm when the king was wont to watch his mother 's eyes for the approval or disapproval of what he had just done . 
Of mistresses there was no question at this dinner . 
The king addressed Aramis two or three times , calling him M. l'ambassadeur , which increased the surprise already felt by D'Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel so marvelously well received at court . 
The king , on rising from table , gave his hand to the queen , and made a sign to Colbert , whose eye was on his master 's face . 
Colbert took D'Artagnan and Aramis on one side . 
The king began to chat with his sister , whilst Monsieur , very uneasy , entertained the queen with a preoccupied air , without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from the corner of his eye . 
The conversation between Aramis , D'Artagnan , and Colbert turned upon indifferent subjects .
