And now , in this burning tomb , this subterranean volcano , seek the king 's guards with their blue coats laced with silver . 
Seek the officers , brilliant in gold , seek for the arms upon which they depended for their defense . 
One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more confused , more shapeless , more terrible than the chaos which existed before the creation of the world . 
There remained nothing of the three compartments - nothing by which God could have recognized His handiwork . 
As for Porthos , after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his enemies , he had fled , as Aramis had directed him to do , and had gained the last compartment , into which air , light , and sunshine penetrated through the opening . 
Scarcely had he turned the angle which separated the third compartment from the fourth when he perceived at a hundred paces from him the bark dancing on the waves . 
There were his friends , there liberty , there life and victory . 
Six more of his formidable strides , and he would be out of the vault ; out of the vault ! 
a dozen of his vigorous leaps and he would reach the canoe . 
Suddenly he felt his knees give way ; his knees seemed powerless , his legs to yield beneath him .
