Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way . 
`` That is where you have been wrong , '' continued he , `` in deceiving me ; for that promised duchy I reckoned upon . 
Oh ! 
I reckoned upon it seriously , knowing you to be a man of your word , Aramis . '' 
`` Poor Porthos ! 
pardon me , I implore you ! '' 
`` So , then , '' continued Porthos , without replying to the bishop 's prayer , `` so then , it seems , I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I will settle all that , my good friend , I will settle all that . 
I will take it on myself alone ! ''
