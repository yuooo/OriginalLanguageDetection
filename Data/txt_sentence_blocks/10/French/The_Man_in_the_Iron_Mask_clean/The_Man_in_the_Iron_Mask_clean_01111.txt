`` It must be full two hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol . '' 
`` Two hundred and sixty to go , and as many to return , '' said D'Artagnan , quietly . 
`` And , '' said the falconer , `` is he well ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Why , poor M. Fouquet , '' continued the falconer , in a low voice . 
The keeper of the harriers had prudently withdrawn . 
`` No , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` the poor man frets terribly ; he can not comprehend how imprisonment can be a favor ; he says that parliament absolved him by banishing him , and banishment is , or should be , liberty .
