Poverty -LRB- a phantom I have sometimes beheld , clad in rags , awaiting me at the end of my journey through life -RRB- - poverty has been the specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past , which they poetize and caress , and which has attracted me towards them . 
Poverty ! 
I accept it , acknowledge it , receive it , as a disinherited sister ; for poverty is neither solitude , nor exile , nor imprisonment . 
Is it likely I shall ever be poor , with such friends as Pelisson , as La Fontaine , as Moliere ? 
with such a mistress as - Oh ! 
if you knew how utterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment , and how you , who separate me from all I love , seem to resemble the image of solitude , of annihilation - death itself . '' 
`` But I have already told you , Monsieur Fouquet , '' replied D'Artagnan , moved to the depths of his soul , `` that you are woefully exaggerating . 
The king likes you . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Fouquet , shaking his head . 
`` M. Colbert hates you . ''
