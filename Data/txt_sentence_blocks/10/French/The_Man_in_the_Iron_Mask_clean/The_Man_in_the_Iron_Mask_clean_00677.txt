D'Artagnan , although no squire of dames , received , nevertheless , civilities and attentions from the ladies ; he was polite , as a brave man always is , and his terrible reputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as admiration among the women . 
On seeing him enter , therefore , they immediately accosted him ; and , as is not unfrequently the case with fair ladies , opened the attack by questions . 
`` Where had he been ? 
What had become of him so long ? 
Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style , to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king 's balcony ? '' 
He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges . 
This set all the ladies laughing . 
Those were times in which everybody traveled , but in which , notwithstanding , a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem often solved by death . 
`` From the land of oranges ? '' 
cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente .
