`` But you , monseigneur ? '' 
Aramis leaned still more forward , and dipped the ends of his long white fingers in the green limpid waters of the sea , to which he turned with smiles as to a friend . 
`` Accept ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` We accept , '' repeated the sailors ; `` but what security have we ? '' 
`` The word of a gentleman , '' said the officer . 
`` By my rank and by my name I swear that all except M. le Chevalier d'Herblay shall have their lives spared . 
I am lieutenant of the king 's frigate the ` Pomona , ' and my name is Louis Constant de Pressigny . '' 
With a rapid gesture , Aramis - already bent over the side of the bark towards the sea - drew himself up , and with a flashing eye , and a smile upon his lips , `` Throw out the ladder , messieurs , '' said he , as if the command had belonged to him . 
He was obeyed .
