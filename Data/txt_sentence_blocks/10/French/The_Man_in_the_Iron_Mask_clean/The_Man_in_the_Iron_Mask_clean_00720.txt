said Colbert , with incredulity , `` I have often experienced it . '' 
`` Formerly ? '' 
`` Very recently , madame , at Vaux . 
It was she who prevented the king from having M. Fouquet arrested . '' 
`` People do not forever entertain the same opinions , my dear monsieur . 
That which the queen may have wished recently , she would not wish , perhaps , to-day . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
said Colbert , astonished . 
`` Oh ! 
the reason is of very little consequence . ''
