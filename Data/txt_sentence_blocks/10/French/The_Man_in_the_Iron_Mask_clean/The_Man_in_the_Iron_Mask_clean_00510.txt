`` Here are , '' murmured Philippe , with a sigh , `` brave friends and good hearts . 
They make me regret the world . 
On , M. d'Artagnan , I follow you . '' 
At the moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room with his prisoner , Colbert appeared , and , after remitting an order from the king to D'Artagnan , retired . 
D'Artagnan read the paper , and then crushed it in his hand with rage . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the prince . 
`` Read , monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer . 
Philippe read the following words , hastily traced by the hand of the king : `` M. d'Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Ile Sainte-Marguerite . 
He will cover his face with an iron vizor , which the prisoner shall never raise except at peril of his life . ''
