`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by .
