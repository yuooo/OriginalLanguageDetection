asked Aramis , deeply interested . 
`` Quite enough , monsieur , to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank , and that Perronnette , without being a lady of quality , was far better than a servant ; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born , since the queen , Anne of Austria , and Mazarin , the prime minister , commended me so earnestly to their care . '' 
Here the young man paused , quite overcome . 
`` And what happened ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` It happened , monsieur , '' answered he , `` that the workmen they had summoned found nothing in the well , after the closest search ; that my governor perceived that the brink was all watery ; that I was not so dried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments were moist ; and , lastly , that I was seized with a violent fever , owing to the chill and the excitement of my discovery , an attack of delirium supervening , during which I related the whole adventure ; so that , guided by my avowal , my governor found the pieces of the queen 's letter inside the bolster where I had concealed them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis , `` now I understand . '' 
`` Beyond this , all is conjecture .
