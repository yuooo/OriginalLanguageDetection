M. Fouquet , for me , is a man gone by - and for you also . '' 
Colbert made no reply . 
`` On his return from Nantes , '' continued the duchesse , `` the king , who is only anxious for a pretext , will find that the States have not behaved well - that they have made too few sacrifices . 
The States will say that the imposts are too heavy , and that the surintendant has ruined them . 
The king will lay all the blame on M. Fouquet , and then - '' `` And then ? '' 
said Colbert . 
`` Oh ! 
he will be disgraced . 
Is not that your opinion ? '' 
Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse , which plainly said : `` If M. Fouquet be only disgraced , you will not be the cause of it . ''
