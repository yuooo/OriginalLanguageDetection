`` I am going to explain it , '' said Porthos . 
`` You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony , who had always seven wild boars kept roasting , each cooked up to a different point ; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it . 
Well , then , I resolved , as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week , I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion . '' 
`` Capitally reasoned , Porthos - only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims . 
Without counting the time lost in being measured , the fashions are always changing . '' 
`` That is exactly the point , '' said Porthos , `` in regard to which I flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device . '' 
`` Tell me what it is ; for I do n't doubt your genius . '' 
`` You remember what Mouston once was , then ? '' 
`` Yes ; when he used to call himself Mousqueton . '' 
`` And you remember , too , the period when he began to grow fatter ? ''
