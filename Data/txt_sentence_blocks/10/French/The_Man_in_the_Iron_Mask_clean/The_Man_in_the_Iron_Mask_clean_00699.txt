He alone with Fouquet knew it ; those two men had not , the one the courage to complain , the other the right to accuse . 
The captain , to whom the two hundred pistoles were brought , was about to take his leave , when Fouquet , rising , took a glass of wine , and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` to the health of the king , whatever may happen . '' 
`` And to your health , monseigneur , whatever may happen , '' said D'Artagnan . 
He bowed , with these words of evil omen , to all the company , who rose as soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs . 
`` I , for a moment , thought it was I and not my money he wanted , '' said Fouquet , endeavoring to laugh . 
`` You ! '' 
cried his friends ; `` and what for , in the name of Heaven ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
do not deceive yourselves , my dear brothers in Epicurus , '' said the superintendent ; `` I do not wish to make a comparison between the most humble sinner on the earth , and the God we adore , but remember , he gave one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper , and which was nothing but a farewell dinner , like that which we are making at this moment .
