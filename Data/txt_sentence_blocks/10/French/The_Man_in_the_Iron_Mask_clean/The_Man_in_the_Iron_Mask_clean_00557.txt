Once in Paris , he really existed no longer . 
When he reached Guiche 's residence , he was informed that Guiche was with Monsieur . 
Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg , and when arrived , without suspecting that he was going to the place where La Valliere had lived , he heard so much music and respired so many perfumes , he heard so much joyous laughter , and saw so many dancing shadows , that if it had not been for a charitable woman , who perceived him so dejected and pale beneath a doorway , he would have remained there a few minutes , and then would have gone away , never to return . 
But , as we have said , in the first ante-chamber he had stopped , solely for the sake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were moving around him in the adjacent salons . 
And as one of Monsieur 's servants , recognizing him , had asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or Madame , Raoul had scarcely answered him , but had sunk down upon a bench near the velvet doorway , looking at a clock , which had stopped for nearly an hour . 
The servant had passed on , and another , better acquainted with him , had come up , and interrogated Raoul whether he should inform M. de Guiche of his being there . 
This name did not even arouse the recollections of Raoul . 
The persistent servant went on to relate that De Guiche had just invented a new game of lottery , and was teaching it to the ladies . 
Raoul , opening his large eyes , like the absent man in Theophrastus , made no answer , but his sadness increased two shades . 
With his head hanging down , his limbs relaxed , his mouth half open for the escape of his sighs , Raoul remained , thus forgotten , in the ante-chamber , when all at once a lady 's robe passed , rubbing against the doors of a side salon , which opened on the gallery .
