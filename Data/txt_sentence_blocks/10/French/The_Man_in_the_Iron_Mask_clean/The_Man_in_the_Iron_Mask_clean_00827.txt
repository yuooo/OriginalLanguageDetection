I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone , because I am ambitious , and , above all , because I have the most entire confidence in my own merit ; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes , and I love to look at the king 's gold ; because , if I live thirty years , in thirty years not a denir of it will remain in my hands ; because , with that gold , I will build granaries , castles , cities , and harbors ; because I will create a marine , I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people ; because I will create libraries and academies ; because I will make France the first country in the world , and the wealthiest . 
These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet , who prevented my acting .

`` Mercy , did you say ? 
then ask his liberty of the king . 
The king is only crushing him on your account . '' 
Colbert again raised his head . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you know that is not so , and that the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet ; it is not for me to teach you that . '' 
`` But the king will grow tired ; he will forget . '' 
`` The king never forgets , M. d'Artagnan .
