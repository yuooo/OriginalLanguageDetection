`` Humph ! 
you must have one , then , '' said Athos , phlegmatically , `` if only to prevent your little fortune being lost . '' 
This word little fortune placed Planchet in his rank , like the voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a piqueur in the regiment of Piedmont , in which Rochefort had placed him . 
Athos perceived that the grocer would marry Truchen , and , in spite of fate , establish a family . 
This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin . 
Having heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer , `` What is M. d'Artagnan about ? '' 
said he ; `` he is not at the Louvre . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte , Monsieur d'Artagnan has disappeared . '' 
`` Disappeared ! ''
