Against this language of the soul the king felt he had no power ; he cast down his eyes , dragging away precipitately his brother and sister , forgetting his mother , sitting motionless within three paces of the son whom she left a second time to be condemned to death . 
Philippe approached Anne of Austria , and said to her , in a soft and nobly agitated voice : `` If I were not your son , I should curse you , my mother , for having rendered me so unhappy . '' 
D'Artagnan felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones . 
He bowed respectfully to the young prince , and said as he bent , `` Excuse me , monseigneur , I am but a soldier , and my oaths are his who has just left the chamber . '' 
`` Thank you , M. d'Artagnan ... . 
What has become of M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` M. d'Herblay is in safety , monseigneur , '' said a voice behind them ; `` and no one , while I live and am free , shall cause a hair to fall from his head . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
said the prince , smiling sadly . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , '' said Fouquet , kneeling , `` but he who is just gone out from hence was my guest . ''
