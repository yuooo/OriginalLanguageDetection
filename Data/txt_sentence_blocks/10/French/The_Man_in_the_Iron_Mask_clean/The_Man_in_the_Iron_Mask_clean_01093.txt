At five o'clock we were victorious at all points ; the enemy had abandoned his positions , and M. le duc ordered the white flag to be planted on the summit of the little mountain . 
It was then we had time to think of M. de Bragelonne , who had eight large wounds in his body , through which almost all his blood had welled away . 
Still , however , he had breathed , which afforded inexpressible joy to monseigneur , who insisted on being present at the first dressing of the wounds and the consultation of the surgeons . 
There were two among them who declared M. de Bragelonne would live . 
Monseigneur threw his arms around their necks , and promised them a thousand louis each if they could save him . 
`` The vicomte heard these transports of joy , and whether he was in despair , or whether he suffered much from his wounds , he expressed by his countenance a contradiction , which gave rise to reflection , particularly in one of the secretaries when he had heard what follows . 
The third surgeon was the brother of Sylvain de Saint-Cosme , the most learned of them all . 
He probed the wounds in his turn , and said nothing . 
M. de Bragelonne fixed his eyes steadily upon the skillful surgeon , and seemed to interrogate his every movement .
