In vain he threw himself before the rashest ; in vain he clung to the rocks to bar the passage ; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave , in the steps of the officer who had spoken last , but who had sprung in first , sword in hand , to face the unknown danger . 
Biscarrat , repulsed by his friends , unable to accompany them , without passing in the eyes of Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer , with painfully attentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers . 
As to the guards , they penetrated further and further , with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced . 
All at once , a discharge of musketry , growling like thunder , exploded in the entrails of the vault . 
Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning . 
At the same instant , cries , shrieks , imprecations burst forth , and the little troop of gentlemen reappeared - some pale , some bleeding - all enveloped in a cloud of smoke , which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the fugitives , `` you knew there was an ambuscade in that cavern , and you did not warn us ! 
Biscarrat , you are the cause that four of us are murdered men !
