`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , `` I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness ; I have not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources which I have at my disposal . 
It is useless to flash bright visions before the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness : useless , too , is it to let the magnificence of the cannon 's roar make itself heard in the ears of one who loves repose and the quiet of the country . 
Monseigneur , I have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts ; listen to my words ; precious they indeed are , in their import and their sense , for you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens , the verdant meadows , the pure air . 
I know a country instinct with delights of every kind , an unknown paradise , a secluded corner of the world - where alone , unfettered and unknown , in the thick covert of the woods , amidst flowers , and streams of rippling water , you will forget all the misery that human folly has so recently allotted you . 
Oh ! 
listen to me , my prince . 
I do not jest . 
I have a heart , and mind , and soul , and can read your own , - aye , even to its depths . 
I will not take you unready for your task , in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires , of my caprice , or my ambition . 
Let it be all or nothing .
