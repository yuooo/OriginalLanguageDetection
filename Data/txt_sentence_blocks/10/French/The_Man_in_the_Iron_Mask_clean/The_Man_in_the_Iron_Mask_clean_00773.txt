The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? ''
