D'Artagnan , still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just had with the king , could not resist asking himself if he were really in possession of his senses , if he were really and truly at Vaux ; if he , D'Artagnan , were really the captain of the musketeers , and M. Fouquet the owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV . 
was at that moment partaking of his hospitality . 
These reflections were not those of a drunken man , although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux , and the surintendant 's wines had met with a distinguished reception at the fete . 
The Gascon , however , was a man of calm self-possession ; and no sooner did he touch his bright steel blade , than he knew how to adopt morally the cold , keen weapon as his guide of action . 
`` Well , '' he said , as he quitted the royal apartment , `` I seem now to be mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the minister ; it will be written , that M. d'Artagnan , a younger son of a Gascon family , placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet , the surintendant of the finances of France . 
My descendants , if I have any , will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest will confer , just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with regard to the estates of the poor Marechal d'Ancre . 
But the thing is , how best to execute the king 's directions in a proper manner . 
Any man would know how to say to M. Fouquet , ` Your sword , monsieur . ' 
But it is not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without others knowing anything about it . 
How am I to manage , then , so that M. le surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace ; that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him ; that after having been steeped to his lips , as it were , in all the perfumes and incense of Ahasuerus , he is transferred to the gallows of Haman ; in other words , of Enguerrand de Marigny ?
