added the king , stamping his foot , `` you do not answer ! '' 
`` We do not answer you , my good monsieur , '' said the giant , in a stentorian voice , `` because there is nothing to say . '' 
`` At least , tell me what you want , '' exclaimed Louis , folding his arms with a passionate gesture . 
`` You will know by and by , '' replied the man who held the lamp . 
`` In the meantime tell me where I am . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Louis looked all round him ; but by the light of the lamp which the masked figure raised for the purpose , he could perceive nothing but the damp walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the snail . 
`` Oh - oh ! 
- a dungeon , '' cried the king . 
`` No , a subterranean passage . ''
