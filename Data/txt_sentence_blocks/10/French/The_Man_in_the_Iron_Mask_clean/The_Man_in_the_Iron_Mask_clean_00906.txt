`` Pardon me , '' said he , `` if I address a question to you ; but men who are in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little . ''

`` Were you not , gentlemen , both in the musketeers of the late king ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , and amongst the best of them , if you please , '' said Porthos . 
`` That is true ; I should say even the best of all soldiers , messieurs , if I did not fear to offend the memory of my father . '' 
`` Of your father ? '' 
cried Aramis .
