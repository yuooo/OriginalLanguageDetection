`` Cordieu ! '' 
cried Athos . 
`` What , are people assassinated here ? 
Come down , cowards as you are ! '' 
`` Yes , come down ! '' 
cried Raoul , furiously shaking his fist at the castle . 
One of the assailants - he who was about to fire - replied to these cries by an exclamation of surprise ; and , as his companion , who wished to continue the attack , had re-seized his loaded musket , he who had cried out threw up the weapon , and the ball flew into the air . 
Athos and Raoul , seeing them disappear from the platform , expected they would come down to them , and waited with a firm demeanor . 
Five minutes had not elapsed , when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms , and they showed themselves on the other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand . 
At the head of these men was an officer , whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket .
