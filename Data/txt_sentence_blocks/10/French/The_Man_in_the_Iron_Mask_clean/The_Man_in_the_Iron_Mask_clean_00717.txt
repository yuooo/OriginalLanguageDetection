Colbert , half stupefied , looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` I can less easily conceive how you , who received the money , can reproach me on that head - '' `` That is , '' said the old duchesse , `` because we must will that which we wish for , unless we are not able to obtain what we wish . '' 
`` Will ! ''
