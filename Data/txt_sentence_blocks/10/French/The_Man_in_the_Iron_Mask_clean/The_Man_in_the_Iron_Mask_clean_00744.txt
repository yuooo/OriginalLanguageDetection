Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ?
