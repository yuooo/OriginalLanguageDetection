And he stooped towards his friend , the falconer , to whom he addressed the question he had put to himself . 
The falconer was about to reply , when the king , perceiving D'Artagnan , `` Ah , comte ! '' 
said he , `` you are amongst us once more then ! 
Why have I not seen you ? '' 
`` Sire , '' replied the captain , `` because your majesty was asleep when I arrived , and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning . '' 
`` Still the same , '' said Louis , in a loud voice , denoting satisfaction . 
`` Take some rest , comte ; I command you to do so . 
You will dine with me to - day . '' 
A murmur of admiration surrounded D'Artagnan like a caress . 
Every one was eager to salute him .
