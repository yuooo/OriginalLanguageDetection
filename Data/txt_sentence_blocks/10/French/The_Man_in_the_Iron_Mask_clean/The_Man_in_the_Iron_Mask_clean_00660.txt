`` I know why you say that , monsieur . 
No , it is not you who have made me what I am ; it was love , which took me at the time when children only have inclinations ; it is the constancy natural to my character , which with other creatures is but habit . 
I believed that I should always be as I was ; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear , quite straight , bordered with fruits and flowers . 
I had ever watching over me your vigilance and strength . 
I believed myself to be vigilant and strong . 
Nothing prepared me ; I fell once , and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my life . 
It is quite true that I wrecked myself . 
Oh , no , monsieur ! 
you are nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope ! 
No , I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me ; I bless you , and I love you ardently . ''
