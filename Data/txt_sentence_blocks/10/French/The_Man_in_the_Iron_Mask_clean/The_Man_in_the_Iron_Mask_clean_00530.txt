`` No ; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with ; it is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal races . 
Doing what you propose , I should become the obliged of the king ; I should certainly be the gainer on that ground , but I should be a loser in my conscience .

`` And now , give me your two best horses to gain the second post , as I have been refused any under the pretext of the Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country . '' 
`` You shall have the two best horses , Aramis ; and again I recommend poor Porthos strongly to your care . ''
