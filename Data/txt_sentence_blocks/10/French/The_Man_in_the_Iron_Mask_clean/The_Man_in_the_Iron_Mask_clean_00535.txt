Athos went towards the house ; but he had hardly reached the parterre , when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze ; all the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road . 
A cry was heard of `` M. le Duc de Beaufort '' - and Athos sprang towards the door of his house . 
But the duke had already alighted from his horse , and was looking around him . 
`` I am here , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Ah ! 
good evening , dear count , '' said the prince , with that frank cordiality which won him so many hearts . 
`` Is it too late for a friend ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear prince , come in ! '' 
said the count .
