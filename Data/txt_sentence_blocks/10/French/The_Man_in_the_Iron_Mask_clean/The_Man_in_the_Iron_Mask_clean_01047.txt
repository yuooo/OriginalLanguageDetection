Mousqueton had become so thin in two days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill - fitting scabbard in which the sword-blade dances at each motion . 
His face , composed of red and white , like that of the Madonna of Vandyke , was furrowed by two silver rivulets which had dug their beds in his cheeks , as full formerly as they had become flabby since his grief began . 
At each fresh arrival , Mousqueton found fresh tears , and it was pitiful to see him press his throat with his fat hand to keep from bursting into sobs and lamentations . 
All these visits were for the purpose of hearing the reading of Porthos 's will , announced for that day , and at which all the covetous friends of the dead man were anxious to be present , as he had left no relations behind him . 
The visitors took their places as they arrived , and the great room had just been closed when the clock struck twelve , the hour fixed for the reading of the important document . 
Porthos 's procureur - and that was naturally the successor of Master Coquenard - commenced by slowly unfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had traced his sovereign will . 
The seal broken - the spectacles put on - the preliminary cough having sounded - every one pricked up his ears . 
Mousqueton had squatted himself in a corner , the better to weep and the better to hear . 
All at once the folding-doors of the great room , which had been shut , were thrown open as if by magic , and a warlike figure appeared upon the threshold , resplendent in the full light of the sun . 
This was D'Artagnan , who had come alone to the gate , and finding nobody to hold his stirrup , had tied his horse to the knocker and announced himself .
