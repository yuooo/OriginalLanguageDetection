`` That will not be sufficient , monseigneur . 
I must have an order from the king . '' 
Fouquet assumed an irritated expression . 
`` As you are so scrupulous , '' he said , `` with regard to allowing prisoners to leave , show me the order by which this one was set at liberty . '' 
Baisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon . 
`` Very good , '' said Fouquet ; `` but Seldon is not Marchiali . '' 
`` But Marchiali is not at liberty , monseigneur ; he is here . '' 
`` But you said that M. d'Herblay carried him away and brought him back again . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` So surely did you say it , that I almost seem to hear it now . ''
