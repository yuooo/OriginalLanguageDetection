When the moon had risen to its fullest height , caressing with light the neighboring peaks , when the watery mirror was illumined in its full extent , and the little red fires had made their openings in the black masses of every ship , Athos , collecting all his ideas and all his courage , said : `` God has made all these things that we see , Raoul ; He has made us also , - poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe . 
We shine like those fires and those stars ; we sigh like those waves ; we suffer like those great ships , which are worn out in plowing the waves , in obeying the wind that urges them towards an end , as the breath of God blows us towards a port . 
Everything likes to live , Raoul ; and everything seems beautiful to living things . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said Raoul , `` we have before us a beautiful spectacle ! '' 
`` How good D'Artagnan is ! '' 
interrupted Athos , suddenly , `` and what a rare good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as he is ! 
That is what you have missed , Raoul . '' 
`` A friend ! '' 
cried Raoul , `` I have wanted a friend ! '' 
`` M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion , '' resumed the comte , coldly , `` but I believe , in the times in which you live , men are more engaged in their own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours .
