`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . ''
