Towards the end of his career , at the moment of reaching the goal , like the patrician Fuscus , he had made a false step upon a plank , and had fallen into the sea . 
But Porthos , good , harmless Porthos ! 
To see Porthos hungry , to see Mousqueton without gold lace , imprisoned , perhaps ; to see Pierrefonds , Bracieux , razed to the very stones , dishonored even to the timber , - these were so many poignant griefs for D'Artagnan , and every time that one of these griefs struck him , he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun . 
Never was the man of spirit subjected to ennui , if his body was exposed to fatigue ; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light , if he had something to engage his mind . 
D'Artagnan , riding fast , thinking as constantly , alighted from his horse in Pairs , fresh and tender in his muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium . 
The king did not expect him so soon , and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon . 
D'Artagnan , instead of riding after the king , as he would formerly have done , took off his boots , had a bath , and waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired . 
He occupied the interval of five hours in taking , as people say , the air of the house , and in arming himself against all ill chances . 
He learned that the king , during the last fortnight , had been gloomy ; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed ; that Monsieur , the king 's brother , was exhibiting a devotional turn ; that Madame had the vapors ; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates . 
He learned that M. Colbert was radiant ; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day , who still did not cure him , and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not usually cure , unless they are political physicians .
