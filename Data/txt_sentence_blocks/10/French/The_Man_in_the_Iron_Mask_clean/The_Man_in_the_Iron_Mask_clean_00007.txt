`` If flowers constitute liberty , '' sadly resumed the captive , `` I am free , for I possess them . '' 
`` But the air ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` air is so necessary to life ! '' 
`` Well , monsieur , '' returned the prisoner ; `` draw near to the window ; it is open . 
Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages of hail and lightning , exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle breezes . 
It caresses my face . 
When mounted on the back of this armchair , with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself , I fancy I am swimming the wide expanse before me . '' 
The countenance of Aramis darkened as the young man continued : `` Light I have ! 
what is better than light ? 
I have the sun , a friend who comes to visit me every day without the permission of the governor or the jailer 's company .
