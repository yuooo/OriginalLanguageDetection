Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon . 
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D'Artagnan . 
His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . 
Athos knew from experience that D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair , whether on his own account or on the service of the king . 
He even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . 
And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the flotilla , and got together the chalands and lighters to send them to Toulon , one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark . 
Athos , believing that this man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish , and so gain more money when all his companions were gone , insisted upon having the details . 
The fisherman informed him that six days previously , a man had come in the night to hire his boat , for the purpose of visiting the island of St. Honnorat .
