They spoke of preceding ministers ; Colbert related the successful tricks of Mazarin , and desired those of Richelieu to be related to him . 
D'Artagnan could not overcome his surprise at finding this man , with his heavy eyebrows and low forehead , display so much sound knowledge and cheerful spirits . 
Aramis was astonished at that lightness of character which permitted this serious man to retard with advantage the moment for more important conversation , to which nobody made any allusion , although all three interlocutors felt its imminence . 
It was very plain , from the embarrassed appearance of Monsieur , how much the conversation of the king and Madame annoyed him . 
Madame 's eyes were almost red : was she going to complain ? 
Was she going to expose a little scandal in open court ? 
The king took her on one side , and in a tone so tender that it must have reminded the princess of the time when she was loved for herself : `` Sister , '' said he , `` why do I see tears in those lovely eyes ? '' 
`` Why - sire - '' said she . 
`` Monsieur is jealous , is he not , sister ? '' 
She looked towards Monsieur , an infallible sign that they were talking about him .
