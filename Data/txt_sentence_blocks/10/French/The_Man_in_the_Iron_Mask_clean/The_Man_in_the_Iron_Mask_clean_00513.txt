All there is of raging passion , mental toothache or mortal threat , raged , gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts of the unhappy prelate . 
His countenance exhibited visible traces of this rude combat . 
Free on the highway to abandon himself to every impression of the moment , Aramis did not fail to swear at every start of his horse , at every inequality in the road . 
Pale , at times inundated with boiling sweats , then again dry and icy , he flogged his horses till the blood streamed from their sides . 
Porthos , whose dominant fault was not sensibility , groaned at this . 
Thus traveled they on for eight long hours , and then arrived at Orleans . 
It was four o'clock in the afternoon . 
Aramis , on observing this , judged that nothing showed pursuit to be a possibility . 
It would be without example that a troop capable of taking him and Porthos should be furnished with relays sufficient to perform forty leagues in eight hours . 
Thus , admitting pursuit , which was not at all manifest , the fugitives were five hours in advance of their pursuers .
