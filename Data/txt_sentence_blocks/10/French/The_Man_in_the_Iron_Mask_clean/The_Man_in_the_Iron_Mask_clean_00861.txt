: Explanations by Aramis . 
`` What I have to say to you , friend Porthos , will probably surprise you , but it may prove instructive . '' 
`` I like to be surprised , '' said Porthos , in a kindly tone ; `` do not spare me , therefore , I beg . 
I am hardened against emotions ; do n't fear , speak out . '' 
`` It is difficult , Porthos - difficult ; for , in truth , I warn you a second time , I have very strange things , very extraordinary things , to tell you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you speak so well , my friend , that I could listen to you for days together . 
Speak , then , I beg - and - stop , I have an idea : I will , to make your task more easy , I will , to assist you in telling me such things , question you . '' 
`` I shall be pleased at your doing so . '' 
`` What are we going to fight for , Aramis ? ''
