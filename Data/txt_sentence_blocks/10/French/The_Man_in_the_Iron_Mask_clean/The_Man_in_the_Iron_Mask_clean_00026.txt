The prisoner reflected a moment . 
`` My enemy must indeed have been very cruel , or hard beset by necessity , to assassinate those two innocent people , my sole support ; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had never harmed a living being . '' 
`` In your family , monseigneur , necessity is stern . 
And so it is necessity which compels me , to my great regret , to tell you that this gentleman and the unhappy lady have been assassinated . '' 
`` Oh , you tell me nothing I am not aware of , '' said the prisoner , knitting his brows . 
`` How ? '' 
`` I suspected it . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` I will tell you . '' 
At this moment the young man , supporting himself on his two elbows , drew close to Aramis 's face , with such an expression of dignity , of self - command and of defiance even , that the bishop felt the electricity of enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his , into his brain of adamant .
