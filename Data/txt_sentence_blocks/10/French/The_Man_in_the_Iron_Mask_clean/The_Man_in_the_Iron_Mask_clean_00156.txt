`` I shall dine here , '' said Loret . 
`` M. de Gourville has promised me some craw-fish . '' 
`` He has promised me some whitings .

Aramis went out laughing , as only he could laugh , and Moliere followed him . 
They were at the bottom of the stairs , when La Fontaine opened the door , and shouted out : `` He has promised us some whitings , In return for these our writings . '' 
The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis opened the door of the study . 
As to Moliere , he had undertaken to order the horses , while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the superintendent . 
`` Oh , how they are laughing there ! ''
