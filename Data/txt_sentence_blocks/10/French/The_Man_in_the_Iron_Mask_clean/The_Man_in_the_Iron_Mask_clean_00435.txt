It would almost seem that it had been built in anticipation of such an act . '' 
`` And at what time did it occur ? '' 
`` Last night , between twelve and one o'clock . '' 
Fouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon Aramis ; he restrained himself . 
`` At Vaux ; under my roof ! '' 
he said , in a half-strangled voice . 
`` I believe so ! 
for it is still your house , and it is likely to continue so , since M. Colbert can not rob you of it now . '' 
`` It was under my roof , then , monsieur , that you committed this crime ? ''
