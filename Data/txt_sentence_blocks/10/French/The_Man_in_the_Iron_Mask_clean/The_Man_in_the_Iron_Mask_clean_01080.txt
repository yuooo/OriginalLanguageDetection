The comte 's people wished to remove Grimaud , who , from a distance , devoured the face now quickly growing marble-pale , and did not approach , from pious fear of bringing to him the breath of death . 
But Grimaud , fatigued as he was , refused to leave the room . 
He sat himself down upon the threshold , watching his master with the vigilance of a sentinel , jealous to receive either his first waking look or his last dying sigh . 
The noises all were quiet in the house - every one respected the slumber of their lord . 
But Grimaud , by anxiously listening , perceived that the comte no longer breathed . 
He raised himself with his hands leaning on the ground , looked to see if there did not appear some motion in the body of his master . 
Nothing ! 
Fear seized him ; he rose completely up , and , at the very moment , heard some one coming up the stairs . 
A noise of spurs knocking against a sword - a warlike sound familiar to his ears - stopped him as he was going towards the bed of Athos . 
A voice more sonorous than brass or steel resounded within three paces of him .
