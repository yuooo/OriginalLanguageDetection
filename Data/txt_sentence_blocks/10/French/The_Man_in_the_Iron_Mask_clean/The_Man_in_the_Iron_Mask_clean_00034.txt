My governor opened the door a few moments after , and thinking I was asleep gently closed it again . 
As soon as ever it was shut , I rose , and , listening , heard the sound of retiring footsteps . 
Then I returned to the shutters , and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together . 
I was alone in the house . 
They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from the window and ran to the well . 
Then , just as my governor had leaned over , so leaned I. Something white and luminous glistened in the green and quivering silence of the water . 
The brilliant disk fascinated and allured me ; my eyes became fixed , and I could hardly breathe . 
The well seemed to draw me downwards with its slimy mouth and icy breath ; and I thought I read , at the bottom of the water , characters of fire traced upon the letter the queen had touched . 
Then , scarcely knowing what I was about , and urged on by one of those instinctive impulses which drive men to destruction , I lowered the cord from the windlass of the well to within about three feet of the water , leaving the bucket dangling , at the same time taking infinite pains not to disturb that coveted letter , which was beginning to change its white tint for the hue of chrysoprase , - proof enough that it was sinking , - and then , with the rope weltering in my hands , slid down into the abyss . 
When I saw myself hanging over the dark pool , when I saw the sky lessening above my head , a cold shudder came over me , a chill fear got the better of me , I was seized with giddiness , and the hair rose on my head ; but my strong will still reigned supreme over all the terror and disquietude .
