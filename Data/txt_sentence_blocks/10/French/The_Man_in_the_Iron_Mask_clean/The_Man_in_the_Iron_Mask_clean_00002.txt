In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudiere , the two first stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly ; for Baisemeaux , though far from disobeying , was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey . 
On arriving at the door , Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner 's chamber ; but Aramis , stopping him on the threshold , said , `` The rules do not allow the governor to hear the prisoner 's confession . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed , and made way for Aramis , who took the lantern and entered ; and then signed to them to close the door behind him . 
For an instant he remained standing , listening whether Baisemeaux and the turnkey had retired ; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their descending footsteps that they had left the tower , he put the lantern on the table and gazed around . 
On a bed of green serge , similar in all respect to the other beds in the Bastile , save that it was newer , and under curtains half-drawn , reposed a young man , to whom we have already once before introduced Aramis . 
According to custom , the prisoner was without a light . 
At the hour of curfew , he was bound to extinguish his lamp , and we perceive how much he was favored , in being allowed to keep it burning even till then . 
Near the bed a large leathern armchair , with twisted legs , sustained his clothes . 
A little table - without pens , books , paper , or ink - stood neglected in sadness near the window ; while several plates , still unemptied , showed that the prisoner had scarcely touched his evening meal . 
Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed , his face half concealed by his arms .
