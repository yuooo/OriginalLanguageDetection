Philippe continued : `` Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against somebody ?

`` My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse , and had good reason for not liking her , '' said the prince . 
`` For my part , I like her no better than he did , and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did , to sow divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money - why - '' `` Well ! 
what ? '' 
said Anne of Austria , proudly , herself provoking the storm . 
`` Well ! ''
