`` We two will keep the powder , the balls , and the muskets here . '' 
`` But only two , my dear Aramis - we shall never fire three shots together , '' said Porthos , innocently , `` the defense by musketry is a bad one . '' 
`` Find a better , then . '' 
`` I have found one , '' said the giant , eagerly ; `` I will place myself in ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar , and invisible , unattackable , if they come in floods , I can let my bar fall upon their skulls , thirty times in a minute . 
Hein ! 
what do you think of the project ? 
You smile ! '' 
`` Excellent , dear friend , perfect ! 
I approve it greatly ; only you will frighten them , and half of them will remain outside to take us by famine . 
What we want , my good friend , is the entire destruction of the troop .
