The procureur resumed : `` I have lived without having any children , and it is probable I never shall have any , which to me is a cutting grief . 
And yet I am mistaken , for I have a son , in common with my other friends ; that is , M. Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne , the true son of M. le Comte de la Fere . 
`` This young nobleman appears to me extremely worthy to succeed the valiant gentleman of whom I am the friend and very humble servant . '' 
Here a sharp sound interrupted the reader . 
It was D'Artagnan 's sword , which , slipping from his baldric , had fallen on the sonorous flooring . 
Every one turned his eyes that way , and saw that a large tear had rolled from the thick lid of D'Artagnan , half-way down to his aquiline nose , the luminous edge of which shone like a little crescent moon . 
`` This is why , '' continued the procureur , `` I have left all my property , movable , or immovable , comprised in the above enumerations , to M. le Vicomte Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne , son of M. le Comte de la Fere , to console him for the grief he seems to suffer , and enable him to add more luster to his already glorious name . '' 
A vague murmur ran through the auditory . 
The procureur continued , seconded by the flashing eye of D'Artagnan , which , glancing over the assembly , quickly restored the interrupted silence : `` On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do give to M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan , captain of the king 's musketeers , whatever the said Chevalier d'Artagnan may demand of my property . 
On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do pay a good pension to M. le Chevalier d'Herblay , my friend , if he should need it in exile .
