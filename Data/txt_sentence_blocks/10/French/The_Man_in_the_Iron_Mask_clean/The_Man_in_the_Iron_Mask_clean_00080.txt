`` Yes , it was Aramis who brought me the invitation . '' 
`` Ah ! 
to be sure , I see . 
You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` By no means ! 
by the king , dear friend . 
The letter bears the following as large as life : 'M . 
le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list - ' '' `` Very good ; but you leave with M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` And when I think , '' cried Porthos , stamping on the floor , `` when I think I shall have no clothes , I am ready to burst with rage ! 
I should like to strangle somebody or smash something ! ''
