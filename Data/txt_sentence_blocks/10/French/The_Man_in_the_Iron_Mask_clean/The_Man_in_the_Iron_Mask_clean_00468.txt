`` There will be a couple of madmen face to face , and the one will kill the other , I am sure . '' 
`` Go ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` If you place your foot on this staircase before I call you , remember that you shall take the place of the meanest prisoner in the Bastile . '' 
`` This job will kill me , I am sure it will , '' muttered Baisemeaux , as he withdrew with tottering steps . 
The prisoner 's cries became more and more terrible . 
When Fouquet had satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase , he inserted the key in the first lock . 
It was then that he heard the hoarse , choking voice of the king , crying out , in a frenzy of rage , `` Help , help ! 
I am the king . '' 
The key of the second door was not the same as the first , and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the bunch .
