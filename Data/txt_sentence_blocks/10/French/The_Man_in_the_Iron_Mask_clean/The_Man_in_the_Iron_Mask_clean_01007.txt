`` I do n't pick you up ; I meet with you , and I beg you to come with me . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` To the king . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a bantering air ; `` the king is disengaged . '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , captain , '' said M. de Gesvres , in a low voice to the musketeer , `` do not compromise yourself ! 
these men hear you . '' 
D'Artagnan laughed aloud , and replied : `` March ! 
People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards and the six last . '' 
`` But as I am not arresting you , '' said M. de Gesvres , `` you will march behind , with me , if you please . ''
