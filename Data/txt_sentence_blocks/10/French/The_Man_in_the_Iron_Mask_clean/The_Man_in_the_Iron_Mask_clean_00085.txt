He possessed a carriage , a country house , men-servants the tallest in Paris ; and by special authority from Louis XIV. , a pack of hounds . 
He worked for MM . 
de Lyonne and Letellier , under a sort of patronage ; but politic man as he was , and versed in state secrets , he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert . 
This is beyond explanation ; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition . 
Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen , intangible ideas ; they act without themselves knowing why . 
The great Percerin -LRB- for , contrary to the rule of dynasties , it was , above all , the last of the Percerins who deserved the name of Great -RRB- , the great Percerin was inspired when he cut a robe for the queen , or a coat for the king ; he could mount a mantle for Monsieur , the clock of a stocking for Madame ; but , in spite of his supreme talent , he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable fit for M. Colbert . 
`` That man , '' he used often to say , `` is beyond my art ; my needle can never dot him down . '' 
We need scarcely say that Percerin was M. Fouquet 's tailor , and that the superintendent highly esteemed him . 
M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old , nevertheless still fresh , and at the same time so dry , the courtiers used to say , that he was positively brittle . 
His renown and his fortune were great enough for M. le Prince , that king of fops , to take his arm when talking over the fashions ; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their accounts in arrear with him ; for Master Percerin would for the first time make clothes upon credit , but the second never , unless paid for the former order .
