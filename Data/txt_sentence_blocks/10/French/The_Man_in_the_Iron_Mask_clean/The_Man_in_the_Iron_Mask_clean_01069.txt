His strength seemed to revive and with it the desire to go to Blois . 
He made his horse turn round : but , at the animal 's first steps , he sunk again into a state of torpor and anguish . 
`` Well ! 
decidedly , '' said he , `` it is willed that I should stay at home . '' 
His people flocked around him ; they lifted him from his horse , and carried him as quickly as possible into the house . 
Everything was prepared in his chamber , and they put him to bed . 
`` You will be sure to remember , '' said he , disposing himself to sleep , `` that I expect letters from Africa this very day . '' 
`` Monsieur will no doubt hear with pleasure that Blaisois 's son is gone on horseback , to gain an hour over the courier of Blois , '' replied his valet de chambre . 
`` Thank you , '' replied Athos , with his placid smile . 
The comte fell asleep , but his disturbed slumber resembled torture rather than repose .
