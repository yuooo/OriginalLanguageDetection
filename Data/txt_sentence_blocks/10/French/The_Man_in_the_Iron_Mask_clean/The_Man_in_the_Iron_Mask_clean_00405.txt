He bowed , amazed , confused , and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis seemed to overwhelm him , as soon as these words had been pronounced . 
`` And then , '' continued the bishop , `` as an answer to what you were coming to ask the king , my dear D'Artagnan , here is an order of his majesty , which you will be good enough to attend to forthwith , for it concerns M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan took the order which was held out to him . 
`` To be set at liberty ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` Ah ! '' 
and he uttered a second `` ah ! '' 
still more full of intelligence than the former ; for this order explained Aramis 's presence with the king , and that Aramis , in order to have obtained Fouquet 's pardon , must have made considerable progress in the royal favor , and that this favor explained , in its tenor , the hardly conceivable assurance with which M. d'Herblay issued the order in the king 's name . 
For D'Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood something of the matter in hand to order to understand the rest . 
He bowed and withdrew a couple of paces , as though he were about to leave .
