`` But all are not so . '' 
`` I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , therefore , is rich - very rich , and I suppose every man knows he is so . '' 
`` Every one , sire ; the living as well as the dead . '' 
`` What does that mean , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
`` The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet 's wealth , - they admire and applaud the result produced ; but the dead , wiser and better informed than we are , know how that wealth was obtained - and they rise up in accusation . '' 
`` So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other . '' 
`` The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it . '' 
`` You have something to say to me more confidentially , I perceive ; do not be afraid , we are quite alone . '' 
`` I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience , and under the protection of your majesty , '' said Colbert , bowing .
