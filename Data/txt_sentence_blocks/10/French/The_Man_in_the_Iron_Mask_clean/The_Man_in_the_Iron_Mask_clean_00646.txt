`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . '' 
`` Your advice is good , Athos , and I will this night have it carried out , or rather , I will carry it out myself ; but let us go in , for the rain falls heavily , and the lightning is terrific . '' 
As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key , they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by the prisoner . 
Upon a sign from D'Artagnan , they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Athos .
