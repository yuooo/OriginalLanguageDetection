The blow was direct . 
It was severe , mortal . 
D'Artagnan , furious at having been anticipated by an idea of the king 's , did not despair , however , even yet ; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle , he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the king has charged some other than myself with his secret orders , it must be because I no longer possess his confidence , and I should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions . 
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king . 
I tender it before you all , enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of France , in such a way as not to compromise the safety of the forces his majesty has confided to me . 
For this purpose , return all to your posts ; within an hour , we shall have the ebb of the tide . 
To your posts , gentlemen ! 
I suppose , '' added he , on seeing that all prepared to obey him , except the surveillant officer , `` you have no orders to object , this time ? '' 
And D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words .
