He had the old habits of war , to live upon the country , keeping his soldiers singing and the enemy weeping . 
The captain of the king 's musketeers well knew his business . 
Never were opportunities better chosen , coups-de-main better supported , errors of the besieged more quickly taken advantage of . 
The army commanded by D'Artagnan took twelve small places within a month . 
He was engaged in besieging the thirteenth , which had held out five days . 
D'Artagnan caused the trenches to be opened without appearing to suppose that these people would ever allow themselves to be taken . 
The pioneers and laborers were , in the army of this man , a body full of ideas and zeal , because their commander treated them like soldiers , knew how to render their work glorious , and never allowed them to be killed if he could help it . 
It should have been seen with what eagerness the marshy glebes of Holland were turned over . 
Those turf-heaps , mounds of potter 's clay , melted at the word of the soldiers like butter in the frying-pans of Friesland housewives . 
M. d'Artagnan dispatched a courier to the king to give him an account of the last success , which redoubled the good humor of his majesty and his inclination to amuse the ladies .
