` Seeing that , ' he continued , ` one may , in awkward circumstances , or in a troublesome position , have one 's doublet on one 's shoulder , and not desire to take one 's doublet off - ' '' `` True , '' said D'Artagnan . '' 
` And so , ' continued M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Moliere , yes . 
` And so , ' went on M. Moliere , ` you want to draw your sword , monsieur , and you have your doublet on your back . 
What do you do ? ' '' '

` Well , no , ' he replied . '' 
` How no ? ' '' ' 
I say that the dress should be so well made , that it will in no way encumber you , even in drawing your sword . ' '' 
` Ah , ah ! ' ''
