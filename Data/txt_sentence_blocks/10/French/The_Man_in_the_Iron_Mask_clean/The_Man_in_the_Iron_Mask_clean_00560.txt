`` Do you wish to speak to me ? '' 
said she , with the smile of former days . 
`` Well ! 
come somewhere else ; for we may be surprised . '' 
`` Oh ! ' 
said he . 
She looked at the clock , doubtingly , then , having reflected : `` In my apartment , '' said she , `` we shall have an hour to ourselves . '' 
And taking her course , lighter than a fairy , she ran up to her chamber , followed by Raoul . 
Shutting the door , and placing in the hands of her cameriste the mantle she had held upon her arm : `` You were seeking M. de Guiche , were you not ? '' 
said she to Raoul .
