you said so yourself . '' 
`` I said so just now , when I did not know you ; but now that I know you , I say - you will evade this dismal fate , if you wish ! '' 
`` How - if we wish ? '' 
echoed Aramis , whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos . 
`` Provided , '' continued Porthos , looking , in his turn , with noble intrepidity , at M. Biscarrat and the bishop - `` provided nothing disgraceful be required of us . '' 
`` Nothing at all will be required of you , gentlemen , '' replied the officer - `` what should they ask of you ? 
If they find you they will kill you , that is a predetermined thing ; try , then , gentlemen , to prevent their finding you . '' 
`` I do n't think I am mistaken , '' said Porthos , with dignity ; `` but it appears evident to me that if they want to find us , they must come and seek us here . '' 
`` In that you are perfectly right , my worthy friend , '' replied Aramis , constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat , who had grown silent and constrained . 
`` You wish , Monsieur de Biscarrat , to say something to us , to make us some overture , and you dare not - is that true ? ''
