`` But the billeting of the king 's military escort , '' objected Colbert , softly , `` will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed , however quick he may be . '' 
`` Double ass that you are ! '' 
thought D'Artagnan ; `` if I had any interest or motive in demolishing your credit with the king , I could do it in ten minutes . 
If I were in the king 's place , '' he added aloud , `` I should , in going to M. Fouquet , leave my escort behind me ; I should go to him as a friend ; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards ; I should consider that I was acting more nobly , and should be invested with a still more sacred character by doing so . '' 
Delight sparkled in the king 's eyes . 
`` That is indeed a very sensible suggestion . 
We will go to see a friend as friends ; the gentlemen who are with the carriages can go slowly : but we who are mounted will ride on . '' 
And he rode off , accompanied by all those who were mounted . 
Colbert hid his ugly head behind his horse 's neck . 
`` I shall be quits , '' said D'Artagnan , as he galloped along , `` by getting a little talk with Aramis this evening .
