replied Colbert , `` we will take care that he shall not get out this time . '' 
`` But you were not attending to what I said to you just now . 
Do you remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so dreaded ? 
And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and experience . '' 
Colbert bit his lips . 
`` We will renounce the idea of the prison , '' said he , in a lower tone : `` we will find a little retreat from which the invincible can not possibly escape . '' 
`` That was well spoken , our ally ! '' 
replied the duchesse . 
`` But it is getting late ; had we not better return ? '' 
`` The more willingly , madame , from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king . ''
