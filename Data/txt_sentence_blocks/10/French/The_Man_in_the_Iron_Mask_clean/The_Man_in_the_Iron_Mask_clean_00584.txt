`` Madame - '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
pardon me , Planchet , I did not know that you had upstairs - '' `` It is Truchen , '' added Planchet , blushing a little . 
`` It is whoever you please , my good Planchet ; but pardon my rudeness . '' 
`` No , no ; go up now , gentlemen . '' 
`` We will do no such thing , '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
madame , having notice , has had time - '' `` No , Planchet ; farewell ! '' 
`` Eh , gentlemen ! 
you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the staircase , or by going away without having sat down . ''
