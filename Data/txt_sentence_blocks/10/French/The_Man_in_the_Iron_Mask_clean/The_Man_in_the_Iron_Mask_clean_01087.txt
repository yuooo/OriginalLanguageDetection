Monseigneur was right , for he loved and wished to spare the young nobleman . 
He was quite right , and the event took upon itself to justify his foresight and refusal ; for scarcely had the sergeant charged with the message solicited by M. de Bragelonne gained the seashore , when two shots from long carbines issued from the enemy 's ranks and laid him low . 
The sergeant fell , dyeing the sand with his blood ; observing which , M. de Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur , who said to him , ` You see , vicomte , I have saved your life . 
Report that , some day , to M. le Comte de la Fere , in order that , learning it from you , he may thank me . ' 
The young nobleman smiled sadly , and replied to the duke , ` It is true , monseigneur , that but for your kindness I should have been killed , where the poor sergeant has fallen , and should be at rest . ' 
M. de Bragelonne made this reply in such a tone that monseigneur answered him warmly , ` Vrai Dieu ! 
Young man , one would say that your mouth waters for death ; but , by the soul of Henry IV. , I have promised your father to bring you back alive ; and , please the Lord , I mean to keep my word . ' 
`` Monseigneur de Bragelonne colored , and replied , in a lower voice , ` Monseigneur , pardon me , I beseech you . 
I have always had a desire to meet good opportunities ; and it is so delightful to distinguish ourselves before our general , particularly when that general is M. le Duc de Beaufort . ' 
`` Monseigneur was a little softened by this ; and , turning to the officers who surrounded him , gave different orders .
