Suddenly , the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis 's shoulders . 
`` I have seen , '' he said , `` my father lying dead upon his funeral couch , in his regal robes . 
That pale face , so calm and worn ; those hands , once so skillful , lying nerveless by his side ; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death ; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams . 
And yet , how numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse - him whom so many others had preceded , hurried away by him into eternal death ! 
No , that king was still the king : he was enthroned still upon that funeral couch , as upon a velvet armchair ; he had not abdicated one title of his majesty . 
God , who had not punished him , can not , will not punish me , who have done nothing . '' 
A strange sound attracted the young man 's attention . 
He looked round him , and saw on the mantel-shelf , just below an enormous crucifix , coarsely painted in fresco on the wall , a rat of enormous size engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread , but fixing all the time , an intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell . 
The king could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust : he moved back towards the door , uttering a loud cry ; and as if he but needed this cry , which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously , to recognize himself , Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his natural senses . 
`` A prisoner ! ''
