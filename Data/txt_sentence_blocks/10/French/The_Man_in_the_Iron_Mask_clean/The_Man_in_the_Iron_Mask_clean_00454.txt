Your watch and ward are admirably kept . '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale , thinking that this remark was made ironically , and portended a furious burst of anger . 
But Fouquet had recovered his breath , and , beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern , who were rubbing their shoulders , towards him , he said , `` There are twenty pistoles for the sentinel , and fifty for the officer . 
Pray receive my compliments , gentlemen . 
I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you . 
And now , M. Baisemeaux , a word with you . '' 
And he followed the governor to his official residence , accompanied by a murmur of general satisfaction . 
Baisemeaux was already trembling with shame and uneasiness . 
Aramis 's early visit , from that moment , seemed to possess consequences , which a functionary such as he -LRB- Baisemeaux -RRB- was , was perfectly justified in apprehending . 
It was quite another thing , however , when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice , and with an imperious look , said , `` You have seen M. d'Herblay this morning ? ''
