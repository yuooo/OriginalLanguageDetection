`` Oh , monsieur ! 
the true king of royalty , in heart , in soul , is not Louis of the Louvre , or Philippe of Sainte - Marguerite ; it is you , proscribed , condemned ! '' 
`` I , who this day am ruined by a single error , M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` What , in the name of Heaven , is that ? '' 
`` I should have had you for a friend ! 
But how shall we return to Nantes ? 
We are a great way from it . '' 
`` That is true , '' said D'Artagnan , gloomily . 
`` The white horse will recover , perhaps ; he is a good horse ! 
Mount , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; I will walk till you have rested a little . ''
