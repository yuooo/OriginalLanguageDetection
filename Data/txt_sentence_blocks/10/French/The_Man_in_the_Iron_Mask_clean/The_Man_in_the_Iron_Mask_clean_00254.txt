`` Is not the king going to sleep at Melun ? '' 
said Colbert , in a low tone of voice , to D'Artagnan . 
M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day , to address himself in that manner to the chief of the musketeers ; for the latter guessed that the king 's intention was very far from that of remaining where he was . 
D'Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and strongly accompanied ; and desired that his majesty would not enter except with all the escort . 
On the other hand , he felt that these delays would irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure . 
In what way could he possibly reconcile these difficulties ? 
D'Artagnan took up Colbert 's remark , and determined to repeated it to the king . 
`` Sire , '' he said , `` M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not intend to sleep at Melun . '' 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
What for ? ''
