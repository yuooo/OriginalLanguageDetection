`` Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake ? '' 
`` No , my friend ; on the contrary , the ground was struck with lightning a hundred paces from the chateau , and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute of water . '' 
`` What in the world is the matter , then ? '' 
`` The fact is , I have received an invitation for the fete at Vaux , '' said Porthos , with a lugubrious expression . 
`` Well ! 
do you complain of that ? 
The king has caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations . 
And so , my dear friend , you are really going to Vaux ? '' 
`` Indeed I am ! '' 
`` You will see a magnificent sight . ''
