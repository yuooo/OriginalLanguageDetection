I am well served , you may perceive . '' 
`` Yes , sire , '' murmured the musketeer , `` you were the only man whose star was equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two friends . 
You have used your power , sire , you will not abuse it , will you ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan , '' said the king , with a smile beaming with kindness , `` I could have M. d'Herblay carried off from the territories of the king of Spain , and brought here , alive , to inflict justice upon him . 
But , D'Artagnan , be assured I will not yield to this first and natural impulse . 
He is free - let him continue free . '' 
`` Oh , sire ! 
you will not always remain so clement , so noble , so generous as you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d'Herblay ; you will have about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging me to pursue rigorous measures . 
The advice to spare M. d'Herblay comes from Colbert himself . ''
