`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . ''
