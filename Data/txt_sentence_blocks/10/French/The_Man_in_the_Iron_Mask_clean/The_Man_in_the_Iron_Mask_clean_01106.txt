Saying these words , she again knelt down , softly and affectionately . 
`` Pardon me the last time , my affianced Raoul ! '' 
said she . 
`` I have broken our chain ; we are both destined to die of grief . 
It is thou who departest first ; fear nothing , I shall follow thee . 
See , only , that I have not been base , and that I have come to bid thee this last adieu . 
The Lord is my witness , Raoul , that if with my life I could have redeemed thine , I would have given that life without hesitation . 
I could not give my love . 
Once more , forgive me , dearest , kindest friend . '' 
She strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth ; then , wiping the tears from her eyes , the heavily stricken lady bowed to D'Artagnan , and disappeared .
