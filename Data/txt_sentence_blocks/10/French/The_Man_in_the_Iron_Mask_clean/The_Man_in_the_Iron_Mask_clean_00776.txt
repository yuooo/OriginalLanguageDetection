`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he .
