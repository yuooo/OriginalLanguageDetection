Four years after the scene we have just described , two horsemen , well mounted , traversed Blois early in the morning , for the purpose of arranging a hawking party the king had arranged to make in that uneven plain the Loire divides in two , which borders on the one side Meung , on the other Amboise . 
These were the keeper of the king 's harriers and the master of the falcons , personages greatly respected in the time of Louis XIII. , but rather neglected by his successor . 
The horsemen , having reconnoitered the ground , were returning , their observations made , when they perceived certain little groups of soldiers , here and there , whom the sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the inclosures . 
These were the king 's musketeers . 
Behind them came , upon a splendid horse , the captain , known by his richly embroidered uniform . 
His hair was gray , his beard turning so . 
He seemed a little bent , although sitting and handling his horse gracefully . 
He was looking about him watchfully . 
`` M. d'Artagnan does not get any older , '' said the keeper of the harriers to his colleague the falconer ; `` with ten years more to carry than either of us , he has the seat of a young man on horseback . '' 
`` That is true , '' replied the falconer .
