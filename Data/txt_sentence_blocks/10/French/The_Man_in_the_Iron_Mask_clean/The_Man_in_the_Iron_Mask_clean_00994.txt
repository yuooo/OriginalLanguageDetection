When Aramis , seizing the rope ladder , walked straight up to the commander , with a firm step , looked at him earnestly , made a sign to him with his hand , a mysterious and unknown sign at sight of which the officer turned pale , trembled , and bowed his head , the sailors were profoundly astonished . 
Without a word Aramis then raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed him the collet of a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand . 
And while making this sign Aramis , draped in cold and haughty majesty , had the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed . 
The commandant , who for a moment had raised his head , bowed a second time with marks of the most profound respect . 
Then stretching his hand out , in his turn , towards the poop , that is to say , towards his own cabin , he drew back to allow Aramis to go first . 
The three Bretons , who had come on board after their bishop , looked at each other , stupefied . 
The crew were awed to silence . 
Five minutes after , the commander called the second lieutenant , who returned immediately , ordering the head to be put towards Corunna . 
Whilst this order was being executed , Aramis reappeared upon the deck , and took a seat near the bastingage . 
Night had fallen ; the moon had not yet risen , yet Aramis looked incessantly towards Belle-Isle .
