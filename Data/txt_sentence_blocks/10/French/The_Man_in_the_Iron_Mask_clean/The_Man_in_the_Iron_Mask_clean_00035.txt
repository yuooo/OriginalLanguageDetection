I gained the water , and at once plunged into it , holding on by one hand , while I immersed the other and seized the dear letter , which , alas ! 
came in two in my grasp . 
I concealed the two fragments in my body-coat , and , helping myself with my feet against the sides of the pit , and clinging on with my hands , agile and vigorous as I was , and , above all , pressed for time , I regained the brink , drenching it as I touched it with the water that streamed off me . 
I was no sooner out of the well with my prize , than I rushed into the sunlight , and took refuge in a kind of shrubbery at the bottom of the garden . 
As I entered my hiding-place , the bell which resounded when the great gate was opened , rang . 
It was my preceptor come back again . 
I had but just time . 
I calculated that it would take ten minutes before he would gain my place of concealment , even if , guessing where I was , he came straight to it ; and twenty if he were obliged to look for me . 
But this was time enough to allow me to read the cherished letter , whose fragments I hastened to unite again . 
The writing was already fading , but I managed to decipher it all .
