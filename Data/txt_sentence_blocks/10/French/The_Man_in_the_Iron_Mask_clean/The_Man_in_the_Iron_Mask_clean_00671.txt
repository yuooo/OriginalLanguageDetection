Athos , forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet , and of his own dignity as a strong man , opened his arms to his son , and pressed him convulsively to his heart . 
`` Accompany us on board , '' said the duke , very much affected ; `` you will gain a good half-hour . '' 
`` No , '' said Athos , `` my farewell has been spoken , I do not wish to voice a second . '' 
`` Then , vicomte , embark - embark quickly ! '' 
added the prince , wishing to spare the tears of these two men , whose hearts were bursting . 
And paternally , tenderly , very much as Porthos might have done , he took Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat , the oars of which , at a signal , immediately were dipped in the waves . 
He himself , forgetful of ceremony , jumped into his boat , and pushed it off with a vigorous foot . 
`` Adieu ! '' 
cried Raoul . 
Athos replied only by a sign , but he felt something burning on his hand : it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud - the last farewell of the faithful dog .
