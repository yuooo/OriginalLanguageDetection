said Monsieur , in a fright . 
`` I will tell you all about that , brother ; but it is strange that M. d'Herblay is not here ! '' 
He called out : `` Let M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him - oh ! 
before you , before you ; do not retire ! '' 
M. de Saint-Aignan returned , bringing satisfactory news of the queen , who only kept her bed from precaution , and to have strength to carry out the king 's wishes . 
Whilst everybody was seeking M. Fouquet and Aramis , the new king quietly continued his experiments , and everybody , family , officers , servants , had not the least suspicion of his identity , his air , his voice , and manners were so like the king 's . 
On his side , Philippe , applying to all countenances the accurate descriptions and key-notes of character supplied by his accomplice Aramis , conducted himself so as not to give birth to a doubt in the minds of those who surrounded him . 
Nothing from that time could disturb the usurper . 
With what strange facility had Providence just reversed the loftiest fortune of the world to substitute the lowliest in its stead ! 
Philippe admired the goodness of God with regard to himself , and seconded it with all the resources of his admirable nature .
