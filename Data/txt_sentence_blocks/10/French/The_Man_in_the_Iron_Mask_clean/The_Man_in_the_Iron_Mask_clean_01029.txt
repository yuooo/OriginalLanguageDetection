A little gold on the lace of their cloaks , a slender stomach in their hauts-de-chausses , a little sparkling of gray in their dry hair , and you will behold the handsome dukes and peers , the haughty marechaux of France .

The king is master ; he wills that I should make verses , he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his ante - chambers with satin shoes . 
Mordioux ! 
that is difficult , but I have got over greater difficulties . 
I will do it . 
Why should I do it ? 
Because I love money ? 
- I have enough .
