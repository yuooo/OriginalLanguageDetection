Immediately outside the gates of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic hand . 
D'Artagnan , who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by crossing the terrace , was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of Nantes . 
One step more , and he was about to descend the stairs , take his trellised carriage , and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
But chance decreed , at the moment of plunging into the staircase , that he was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said the musketeer to himself ; `` a horse galloping , - a runaway horse , no doubt . 
What a rate he is going at ! '' 
The moving point became detached from the road , and entered into the fields . 
`` A white horse , '' continued the captain , who had just observed the color thrown luminously against the dark ground , `` and he is mounted ; it must be some boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him . '' 
These reflections , rapid as lightning , simultaneous with visual perception , D'Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first steps of the staircase .
