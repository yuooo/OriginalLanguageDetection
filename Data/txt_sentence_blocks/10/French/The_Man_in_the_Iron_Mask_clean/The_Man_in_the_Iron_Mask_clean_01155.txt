Madame set out for London , where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother , Charles II. , acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle de Keroualle , that the alliance between England and France was signed , and the English vessels , ballasted by a few millions of French gold , made a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces . 
Charles II . 
had promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude for her good counsels ; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth . 
Colbert had promised the king vessels , munitions , victories . 
He kept his word , as is well known . 
At length Aramis , upon whose promises there was least dependence to be placed , wrote Colbert the following letter , on the subject of the negotiations which he had undertaken at Madrid : `` MONSIEUR COLBERT , - I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P. Oliva , general ad interim of the Society of Jesus , my provisional successor . 
The reverend father will explain to you , Monsieur Colbert , that I preserve to myself the direction of all the affairs of the order which concern France and Spain ; but that I am not willing to retain the title of general , which would throw too high a side-light on the progress of the negotiations with which His Catholic Majesty wishes to intrust me . 
I shall resume that title by the command of his majesty , when the labors I have undertaken in concert with you , for the great glory of God and His Church , shall be brought to a good end . 
The R. P. Oliva will inform you likewise , monsieur , of the consent His Catholic Majesty gives to the signature of a treaty which assures the neutrality of Spain in the event of a war between France and the United Provinces . 
This consent will be valid even if England , instead of being active , should satisfy herself with remaining neutral .
