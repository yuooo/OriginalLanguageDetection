You do not observe , monseigneur , you have given him command of the first order . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` And in your naval arrangements , too . '' 
`` That may be true . 
But one finds that such fine young fellows as your son generally do all that is required of them . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and intelligence , so much real bravery , as in Raoul ; but if he failed to arrange your embarkation , you would only meet the fate that you deserve . '' 
`` Humph ! 
you are scolding me , then . '' 
`` Monseigneur , to provision a fleet , to assemble a flotilla , to enroll your maritime force , would take an admiral a year . 
Raoul is a cavalry officer , and you allow him a fortnight ! ''
