This morning , when I got up , I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the aiguillettes , and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off . 
That is an infallible sign . '' 
`` Of prosperity ? '' 
`` Yes , be sure of it ; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to my back , it always signified a punishment from M. de Treville , or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin . 
Every time my sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt , it always predicted some disagreeable commission or another for me to execute , and I have had showers of them all my life through . 
Every time , too , my sword danced about in its sheath , a duel , fortunate in its result , was sure to follow : whenever it dangled about the calves of my legs , it signified a slight wound ; every time it fell completely out of the scabbard , I was booked , and made up my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle , with two or three months under surgical bandages into the bargain . '' 
`` I did not know your sword kept you so well informed , '' said Fouquet , with a faint smile , which showed how he was struggling against his own weakness . 
`` Is your sword bewitched , or under the influence of some imperial charm ? '' 
`` Why , you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own body . 
I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them by feeling something the matter with their legs , or a throbbing of their temples .
