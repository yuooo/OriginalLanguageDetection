`` An order of release ! 
There , now ; excellent news indeed to disturb us ! '' 
`` Excellent news for him whom it concerns , you will at least agree , my dear governor ! '' 
`` And at eight o'clock in the evening ! '' 
`` It is charitable ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
charity is all very well , but it is for that fellow who says he is so weary and tired , but not for me who am amusing myself , '' said Baisemeaux , exasperated . 
`` Will you lose by him , then ? 
And is the prisoner who is to be set at liberty a good payer ? ''
