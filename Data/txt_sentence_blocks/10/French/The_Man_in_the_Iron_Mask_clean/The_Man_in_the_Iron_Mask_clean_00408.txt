`` Oh ! 
yes , you can thank M. l'eveque de Vannes , '' pursued D'Artagnan , `` for it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the king . '' 
`` Oh ! ''

`` But you , '' continued D'Artagnan , addressing Aramis - `` you , who have become M. Fouquet 's protector and patron , can you not do something for me ? '' 
`` Anything in the wide world you like , my friend , '' replied the bishop , in his calmest tones . 
`` One thing only , then , and I shall be perfectly satisfied .
