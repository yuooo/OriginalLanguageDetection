`` He is content , '' said the falconer , in a low voice , to the musketeer ; `` we all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays ; if he were a falconer he would not talk in that way . '' 
D'Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political question resolved by the discontent of such humble interest . 
He for a moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant , the crumbling of his fortunes , and the melancholy death that awaited him ; and to conclude , `` Did M. Fouquet love falconry ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh , passionately , monsieur ! '' 
repeated the falconer , with an accent of bitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other to pass , and continued to advance . 
They could already catch glimpses of the huntsmen at the issue of the wood , the feathers of the outriders passing like shooting stars across the clearings , and the white horses skirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions . 
`` But , '' resumed D'Artagnan , `` will the sport last long ? 
Pray , give us a good swift bird , for I am very tired .
