said D'Artagnan , reflecting in vain . 
`` Here ! '' 
cried an old man , white as snow , sitting bent in his carriage , which he caused to be thrown open to make room for the musketeer . 
`` Aramis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , struck with profound amazement . 
And he felt , inert as it was , the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round his neck . 
Colbert , after having observed them in silence for a few moments , urged his horse forward , and left the two old friends together . 
`` And so , '' said the musketeer , taking Aramis 's arm , `` you , the exile , the rebel , are again in France ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
and I shall dine with you at the king 's table , '' said Aramis , smiling .
