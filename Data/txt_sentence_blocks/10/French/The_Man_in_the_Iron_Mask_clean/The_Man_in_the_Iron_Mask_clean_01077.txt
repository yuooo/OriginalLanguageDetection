And the sweat began to pour down his face . 
Grimaud appeared in the doorway . 
It was no longer the Grimaud we have seen , still young with courage and devotion , when he jumped the first into the boat destined to convey Raoul de Bragelonne to the vessels of the royal fleet . 
'T was now a stern and pale old man , his clothes covered with dust , and hair whitened by old age . 
He trembled whilst leaning against the door-frame , and was near falling on seeing , by the light of the lamps , the countenance of his master . 
These two men who had lived so long together in a community of intelligence , and whose eyes , accustomed to economize expressions , knew how to say so many things silently - these two old friends , one as noble as the other in heart , if they were unequal in fortune and birth , remained tongue-tied whilst looking at each other . 
By the exchange of a single glance they had just read to the bottom of each other 's hearts . 
The old servitor bore upon his countenance the impression of a grief already old , the outward token of a grim familiarity with woe . 
He appeared to have no longer in use more than a single version of his thoughts . 
As formerly he was accustomed not to speak much , he was now accustomed not to smile at all .
