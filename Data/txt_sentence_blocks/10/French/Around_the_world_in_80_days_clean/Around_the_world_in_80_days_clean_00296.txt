Shortly before the detachment arrived , Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors , three of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists , when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief . 
All were welcomed with joyful cries . 
Phileas Fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers , while Passepartout , not without reason , muttered to himself , `` It must certainly be confessed that I cost my master dear ! '' 
Fix , without saying a word , looked at Mr. Fogg , and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him . 
As for Aouda , she took her protector 's hand and pressed it in her own , too much moved to speak . 
Meanwhile , Passepartout was looking about for the train ; he thought he should find it there , ready to start for Omaha , and he hoped that the time lost might be regained . 
`` The train ! 
the train ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Gone , '' replied Fix .
