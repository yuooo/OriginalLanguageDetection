cried Stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend . 
`` Come , let 's go on with the game . '' 
`` Deal over again , then , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
`` There 's a false deal . '' 
Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand ; then suddenly put them down again . 
`` Well , Mr. Fogg , '' said he , `` it shall be so : I will wager the four thousand on it . '' 
`` Calm yourself , my dear Stuart , '' said Fallentin . 
`` It 's only a joke . '' 
`` When I say I 'll wager , '' returned Stuart , `` I mean it . '' 
`` All right , '' said Mr. Fogg ; and , turning to the others , he continued : `` I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring 's which I will willingly risk upon it . ''
