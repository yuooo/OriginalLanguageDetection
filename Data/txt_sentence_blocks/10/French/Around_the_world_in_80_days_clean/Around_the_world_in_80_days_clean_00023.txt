`` I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less ; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours , or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes . 
Do you accept ? '' 
`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , Fallentin , Sullivan , Flanagan , and Ralph , after consulting each other . 
`` Good , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine . 
I will take it . '' 
`` This very evening ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` This very evening , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
He took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added , `` As today is Wednesday , the 2nd of October , I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club , on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine p.m. ; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at Baring 's , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen .
