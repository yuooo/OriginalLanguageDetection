Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy . 
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying .

`` Certain , sir , '' replied the engineer . 
`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux , we have n't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool . ''

`` Ah , if my master can get over that , '' muttered he , `` he 'll be a famous man ! '' 
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard .
