It was then seven o'clock . 
The captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take . 
Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ? 
Should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ? 
His hesitation did not last long , however . 
Calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard . 
Was it a signal ? 
The soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order . 
Mr. Fogg was marching at their head , and just behind him were Passepartout and the other two travellers , rescued from the Sioux . 
They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney .
