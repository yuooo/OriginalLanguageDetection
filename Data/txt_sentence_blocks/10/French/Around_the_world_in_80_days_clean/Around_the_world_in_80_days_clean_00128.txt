Since leaving London , what with travelling expenses , bribes , the purchase of the elephant , bails , and fines , Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way , and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives , was rapidly diminishing . 
IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT IS SAID TO HIM The Rangoon -- one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company 's boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas -- was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse-power . 
She was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the Mongolia , and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished . 
However , the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please . 
During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done . 
The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda 's comfort . 
He visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk . 
He treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose . 
Aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world . 
After all , she owed Phileas Fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .
