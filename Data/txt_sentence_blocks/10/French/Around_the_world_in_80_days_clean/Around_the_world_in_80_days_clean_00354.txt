I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand . '' 
`` It is clear , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and we have nothing to do but to present Mr. Fogg 's cheque at Barings to-morrow . '' 
At this moment , the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine . 
`` Five minutes more , '' said Andrew Stuart . 
The five gentlemen looked at each other . 
Their anxiety was becoming intense ; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to Mr. Fallentin 's proposal of a rubber . 
`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said Andrew Stuart , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . '' 
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine . 
The players took up their cards , but could not keep their eyes off the clock . 
Certainly , however secure they felt , minutes had never seemed so long to them !
