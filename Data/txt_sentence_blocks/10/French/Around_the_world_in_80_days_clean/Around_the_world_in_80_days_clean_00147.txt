Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . 
Everything had gone so well till now ! 
Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master 's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . 
Had the hour of adversity come ? 
Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . 
The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . 
Poor fellow ! 
Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . 
Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . 
He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions .
