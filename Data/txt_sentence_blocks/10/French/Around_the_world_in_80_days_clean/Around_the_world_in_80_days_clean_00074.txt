Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train ; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed . 
The travellers crossed , beyond Milligaum , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali . 
Not far off rose Ellora , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous Aurungabad , capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam . 
It was thereabouts that Feringhea , the Thuggee chief , king of the stranglers , held his sway . 
These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction . 
The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders , though the Thuggees still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites . 
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet . 
The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty , which empties into the Gulf of Cambray , near Surat . 
Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . 
Up to his arrival at Bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams .
