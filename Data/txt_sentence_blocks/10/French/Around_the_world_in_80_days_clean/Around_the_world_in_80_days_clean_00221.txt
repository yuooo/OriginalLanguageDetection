But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect , Passepartout would not have admitted , even if he had comprehended it . 
Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner . 
Where was Fix at that moment ? 
He was actually on board the General Grant . 
On reaching Yokohama , the detective , leaving Mr. Fogg , whom he expected to meet again during the day , had repaired at once to the English consulate , where he at last found the warrant of arrest . 
It had followed him from Bombay , and had come by the Carnatic , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be . 
Fix 's disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless . 
Mr. Fogg had left English ground , and it was now necessary to procure his extradition ! 
`` Well , '' thought Fix , after a moment of anger , `` my warrant is not good here , but it will be in England . 
The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country , thinking he has thrown the police off his track .
