`` Alas ! 
In my hurry -- I -- I forgot -- '' `` What ? '' 
`` To turn off the gas in my room ! '' 
`` Very well , young man , '' returned Mr. Fogg , coolly ; `` it will burn -- at your expense . '' 
IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS , UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED MEN , APPEARS ON ` CHANGE Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End . 
The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club , and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members . 
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England . 
The boasted `` tour of the world '' was talked about , disputed , argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim . 
Some took sides with Phileas Fogg , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him ; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling . 
The Times , Standard , Morning Post , and Daily News , and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg 's project as madness ; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him .
