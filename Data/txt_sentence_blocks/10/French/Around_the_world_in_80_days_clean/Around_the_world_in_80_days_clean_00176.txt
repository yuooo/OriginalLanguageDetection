Fix ceased to breathe at all . 
`` How ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` By going to Nagasaki , at the extreme south of Japan , or even to Shanghai , which is only eight hundred miles from here . 
In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast , which would be a great advantage , as the currents run northward , and would aid us . 
`` Pilot , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` I must take the American steamer at Yokohama , and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
returned the pilot . 
`` The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama . 
It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki , but it starts from Shanghai . ''
