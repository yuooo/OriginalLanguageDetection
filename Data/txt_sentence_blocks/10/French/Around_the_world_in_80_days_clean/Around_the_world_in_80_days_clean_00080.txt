`` I shall go afoot , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
Passepartout , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail Indian shoes . 
Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moment 's hesitation , said , `` Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` An elephant ! 
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . '' 
`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question . 
An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure . 
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
