After his first depression , Passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . 
It was certainly not an enviable one . 
He found himself on the way to Japan , and what should he do when he got there ? 
His pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . 
His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . 
He fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and himself . 
He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for . 
At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama . 
This is an important port of call in the Pacific , where all the mail-steamers , and those carrying travellers between North America , China , Japan , and the Oriental islands put in . 
It is situated in the bay of Yeddo , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese Empire , and the residence of the Tycoon , the civil Emperor , before the Mikado , the spiritual Emperor , absorbed his office in his own .
