The crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . 
The undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . 
Many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height . 
`` It is evidently a meeting , '' said Fix , `` and its object must be an exciting one . 
I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama , despite the fact that that question is settled . '' 
`` Perhaps , '' replied Mr. Fogg , simply . 
`` At least , there are two champions in presence of each other , the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy . '' 
Aouda , leaning upon Mr. Fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . 
Before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . 
Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd .
