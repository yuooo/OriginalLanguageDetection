But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice . 
The passengers resumed their places in the cars . 
Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed . 
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game . 
The locomotive whistled vigorously ; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap . 
Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second . 
They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all . 
And they passed over ! 
It was like a flash . 
No one saw the bridge .
