`` Those chords give the fifth and the octave , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
These were the only words he uttered during the journey . 
Aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . 
As for Passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . 
With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . 
They would reach New York on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool . 
Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally , Fix , by the hand . 
He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge , the only means of reaching Omaha in time ; but , checked by some presentiment , he kept his usual reserve . 
One thing , however , Passepartout would never forget , and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made , without hesitation , to rescue him from the Sioux . 
Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life .
