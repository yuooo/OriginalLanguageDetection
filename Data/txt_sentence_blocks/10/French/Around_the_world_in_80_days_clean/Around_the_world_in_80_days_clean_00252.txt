From this point it described a long curve , descending towards Bitter Creek Valley , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific . 
There were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek , Green Creek , and others , upon culverts . 
Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on , while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region , and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents , and set foot on English soil . 
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station , and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory , following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout .
