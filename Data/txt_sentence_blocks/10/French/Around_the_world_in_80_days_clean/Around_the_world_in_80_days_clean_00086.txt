What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad ? 
Would he carry him on with him ? 
Impossible ! 
The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive . 
Would he sell him , or set him free ? 
The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration . 
Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him , Passepartout , a present of Kiouni , he would be very much embarrassed ; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time . 
The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined bungalow . 
They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad . 
The night was cold .
