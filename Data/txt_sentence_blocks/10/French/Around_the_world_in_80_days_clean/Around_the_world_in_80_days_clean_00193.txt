That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at Shanghai , if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama . 
Had there been no storm , during which several hours were lost , they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination . 
The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it . 
All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five miles of Shanghai . 
There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance . 
All on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- Phileas Fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . 
The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! 
It was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . 
Still , the Tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River . 
Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream .
