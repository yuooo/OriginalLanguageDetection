The door swung open , and he saw Passepartout , Aouda , and Fix , who hurried towards him . 
Fix was out of breath , and his hair was in disorder . 
He could not speak . 
`` Sir , '' he stammered , `` sir -- forgive me -- most -- unfortunate resemblance -- robber arrested three days ago -- you are free ! '' 
Phileas Fogg was free ! 
He walked to the detective , looked him steadily in the face , and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life , or which he ever would make , drew back his arms , and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down . 
`` Well hit ! '' 
cried Passepartout , `` Parbleu ! 
that 's what you might call a good application of English fists ! '' 
Fix , who found himself on the floor , did not utter a word .
