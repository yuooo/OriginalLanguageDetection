The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons , as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht . 
Her shining copper sheathing , her galvanised iron-work , her deck , white as ivory , betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable . 
Her two masts leaned a trifle backward ; she carried brigantine , foresail , storm-jib , and standing-jib , and was well rigged for running before the wind ; and she seemed capable of brisk speed , which , indeed , she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races . 
The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the Chinese seas . 
John Bunsby , himself , a man of forty-five or thereabouts , vigorous , sunburnt , with a sprightly expression of the eye , and energetic and self-reliant countenance , would have inspired confidence in the most timid . 
Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board , where they found Fix already installed . 
Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan ; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp . 
The accommodation was confined , but neat . 
`` I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , '' said Mr. Fogg to Fix , who bowed without responding . 
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg .
