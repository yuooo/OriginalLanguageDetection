The resolution taken , it remained to carry it out . 
It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange . 
The man liked the European costume , and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat , and a sort of one-sided turban , faded with long use . 
A few small pieces of silver , moreover , jingled in his pocket . 
Good ! '' 
thought he . 
`` I will imagine I am at the Carnival ! '' 
His first care , after being thus `` Japanesed , '' was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance , and , upon half a bird and a little rice , to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved . 
`` Now , '' thought he , when he had eaten heartily , `` I must n't lose my head . 
I ca n't sell this costume again for one still more Japanese .
