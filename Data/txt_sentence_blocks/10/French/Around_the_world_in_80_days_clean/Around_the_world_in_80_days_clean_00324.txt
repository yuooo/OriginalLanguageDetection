`` Keep them up to the last . 
Let the valves be filled . '' 
Towards noon Phileas Fogg , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy . 
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger . 
He went to the poop , saying to himself , `` He will be like a madman ! '' 
In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck . 
The bomb was Captain Speedy . 
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting . 
`` Where are we ? ''
