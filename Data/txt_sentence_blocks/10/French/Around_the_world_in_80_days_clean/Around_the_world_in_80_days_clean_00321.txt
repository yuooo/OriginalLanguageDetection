The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . 
Sometinies the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead . 
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour . 
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless . 
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg 's departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed . 
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed . 
In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain . 
In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season . 
Passepartout said nothing ; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam . 
On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to Mr. Fogg , and began to speak earnestly with him .
