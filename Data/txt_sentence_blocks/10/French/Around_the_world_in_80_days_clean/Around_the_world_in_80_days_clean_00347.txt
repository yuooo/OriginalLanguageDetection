`` But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ? '' 
`` As I am in the habit of doing . '' 
`` At least , '' said Aouda , `` want should not overtake a man like you . 
Your friends -- '' `` I have no friends , madam . '' 
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . '' 
`` I pity you , then , Mr. Fogg , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs . 
They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience . '' 
`` They say so , madam . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' said Aouda , rising and seizing his hand , `` do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ? 
Will you have me for your wife ? ''
