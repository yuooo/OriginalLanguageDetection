The Long Noses form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god Tingou . 
Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings ; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them . 
These noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them . 
It was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises . 
A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning-rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults . 
As a last scene , a `` human pyramid '' had been announced , in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut . 
But , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other 's shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses . 
It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , Passepartout had been chosen to take his place . 
The poor fellow really felt sad when -- melancholy reminiscence of his youth ! 
-- he donned his costume , adorned with vari-coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long .
