According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage . 
He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge . 
It may be taken for granted that , rash as the Americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it .

`` Hum ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor ; `` but we are not going to stay here , I imagine , and take root in the snow ? '' 
`` Colonel , '' replied the conductor , `` we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train , but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow is less than six hours . '' 
`` Six hours ! '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` Certainly , '' returned the conductor , `` besides , it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot . ''
