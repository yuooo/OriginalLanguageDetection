If you had not suggested our marriage , my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel Wilson 's , I should not have been apprised of my error , and -- '' `` Dear Mr. Fogg ! '' 
said the young woman . 
`` Dear Aouda ! '' 
replied Phileas Fogg . 
It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after , and that Passepartout , glowing and dazzling , gave the bride away . 
Had he not saved her , and was he not entitled to this honour ? 
The next day , as soon as it was light , Passepartout rapped vigorously at his master 's door . 
Mr. Fogg opened it , and asked , `` What 's the matter , Passepartout ? '' 
`` What is it , sir ? 
Why , I 've just this instant found out -- '' `` What ? ''
