The weather was dismal , and it was very cold . 
Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . 
Aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting-room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . 
She heard and saw nothing . 
Then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain . 
Evening came , and the little band had not returned . 
Where could they be ? 
Had they found the Indians , and were they having a conflict with them , or were they still wandering amid the mist ? 
The commander of the fort was anxious , though he tried to conceal his apprehensions . 
As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold .
