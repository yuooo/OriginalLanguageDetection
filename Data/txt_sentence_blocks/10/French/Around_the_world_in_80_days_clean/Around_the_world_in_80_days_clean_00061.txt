`` Then you know India ? '' 
`` Why yes , '' replied Fix , who spoke cautiously . 
`` A curious place , this India ? '' 
`` Oh , very curious . 
Mosques , minarets , temples , fakirs , pagodas , tigers , snakes , elephants ! 
I hope you will have ample time to see the sights . '' 
`` I hope so , Monsieur Fix . 
You see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days ! 
No ; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at Bombay . '' 
`` And Mr. Fogg is getting on well ? ''
