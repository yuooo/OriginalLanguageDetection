Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion ; the former , as cool as ever , tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman 's arm , but in vain . 
A big brawny fellow with a red beard , flushed face , and broad shoulders , who seemed to be the chief of the band , raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg , whom he would have given a crushing blow , had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead . 
An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective 's silk hat , which was completely smashed in . 
`` Yankee ! '' 
exclaimed Mr. Fogg , darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian . 
`` Englishman ! '' 
returned the other . 
`` We will meet again ! '' 
`` When you please . '' 
`` What is your name ? ''
