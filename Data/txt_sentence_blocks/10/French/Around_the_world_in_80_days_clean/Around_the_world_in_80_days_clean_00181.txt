Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong , and the Tankadere , impelled by favourable winds , conducted herself admirably . 
`` I do not need , pilot , '' said Phileas Fogg , when they got into the open sea , `` to advise you to use all possible speed . '' 
`` Trust me , your honour . 
We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us . 
The poles would add nothing , and are only used when we are going into port . '' 
`` Its your trade , not mine , pilot , and I confide in you . '' 
Phileas Fogg , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters . 
The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel . 
Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings . 
The boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air .
