The guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . 
Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east . 
They stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated . 
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles ; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods . 
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters , and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished , when the elephant , becoming restless , suddenly stopped . 
It was then four o'clock . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Sir Francis , putting out his head . 
`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the Parsee , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches . 
The murmur soon became more distinct ; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments .
