Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station . 
The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling . 
Phileas Fogg , snugly ensconced in his corner , did not open his lips . 
Passepartout , not yet recovered from his stupefaction , clung mechanically to the carpet-bag , with its enormous treasure .
