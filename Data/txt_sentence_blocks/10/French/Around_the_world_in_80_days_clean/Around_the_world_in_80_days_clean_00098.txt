This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves ; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night , and not when , at break of day , the victim was led to her funeral pyre . 
Then no human intervention could save her . 
As soon as night fell , about six o'clock , they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda . 
The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing ; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp , and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself . 
The Parsee , leading the others , noiselessly crept through the wood , and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream , whence , by the light of the rosin torches , they perceived a pyre of wood , on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah , which was to be burned with his wife . 
The pagoda , whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk , stood a hundred steps away . 
`` Come ! '' 
whispered the guide . 
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush , followed by his companions ; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches . 
Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade , which was lit up by the torches .
