To disembark from the Henrietta , jump into a hack , hurry to the St. Nicholas , and return with Aouda , Passepartout , and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time , and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him . 
They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor . 
When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost , he uttered a prolonged `` Oh ! '' 
which extended throughout his vocal gamut . 
As for Fix , he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified . 
When they reached England , even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea , more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent ! 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION An hour after , the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson , turned the point of Sandy Hook , and put to sea . 
During the day she skirted Long Island , passed Fire Island , and directed her course rapidly eastward . 
At noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel 's position . 
It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy .
