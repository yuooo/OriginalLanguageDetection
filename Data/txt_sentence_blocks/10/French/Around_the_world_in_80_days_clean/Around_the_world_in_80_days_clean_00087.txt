The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . 
The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . 
The guide watched Kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . 
Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls front panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . 
Sir Francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . 
Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . 
As for Mr. Fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row . 
The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening . 
In that case , Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . 
Kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the Vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger , on the Cani , one of the branches of the Ganges .
