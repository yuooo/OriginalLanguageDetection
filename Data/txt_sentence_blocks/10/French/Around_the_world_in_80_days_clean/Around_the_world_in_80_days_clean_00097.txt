The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant . 
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an European . 
Her name was Aouda . 
Left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape . 
The Parsee 's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design . 
It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible . 
They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly . 
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim . 
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned . 
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?
