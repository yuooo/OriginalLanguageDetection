A clay and pebble wall , built in 1853 , surrounded the town ; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions . 
The place did not seem thickly populated . 
The streets were almost deserted , except in the vicinity of the temple , which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades . 
There were many women , which was easily accounted for by the `` peculiar institution '' of the Mormons ; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists . 
They are free to marry or not , as they please ; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry , as , according to the Mormon religion , maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys . 
These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy . 
Some -- the more well-to-do , no doubt -- wore short , open , black silk dresses , under a hood or modest shawl ; others were habited in Indian fashion . 
Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women , charged , in groups , with conferring happiness on a single Mormon . 
His common sense pitied , above all , the husband . 
It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life , and to conduct them , as it were , in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith , who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place , to all eternity .
