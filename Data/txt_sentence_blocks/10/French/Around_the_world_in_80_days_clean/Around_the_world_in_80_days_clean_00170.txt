At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached . 
It was Fix , who , bowing , addressed Mr. Fogg : `` Were you not , like me , sir , a passenger by the Rangoon , which arrived yesterday ? '' 
`` I was , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg coldly . 
`` But I have not the honour -- '' `` Pardon me ; I thought I should find your servant here . '' 
`` Do you know where he is , sir ? '' 
asked Aouda anxiously . 
`` What ! '' 
responded Fix , feigning surprise . 
`` Is he not with you ? '' 
`` No , '' said Aouda .
