But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat . 
He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut . 
They all stretched themselves on the floor , their noses pointing to the ceiling . 
A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages , then a third above these , then a fourth , until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses . 
This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards ! 
It was Passepartout 's fault . 
Abandoning his position , clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings , and , clambering up to the right-hand gallery , he fell at the feet of one of the spectators , crying , `` Ah , my master ! 
my master ! '' 
`` You here ? '' 
`` Myself . ''
