The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed , however , and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca , which gave access to the China seas . 
What was detective Fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ? 
He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . 
It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout 's suspicions , who thought him still at Bombay . 
But necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen . 
All the detective 's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong ; for the steamer 's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there . 
The arrest must be made at Hong Kong , or the robber would probably escape him for ever . 
Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot ; beyond , China , Japan , America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge . 
If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong , Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police , and there would be no further trouble . 
But beyond Hong Kong , a simple warrant would be of no avail ; an extradition warrant would be necessary , and that would result in delays and obstacles , of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice .
