This noble lord , who was fastened to his chair , would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world , if it took ten years ; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg . 
When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , `` If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman . '' 
The Fogg party dwindled more and more , everybody was going against him , and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one ; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price . 
The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening , when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands : Suez to London . 
Rowan , Commissioner of Police , Scotland Yard : I 've found the bank robber , Phileas Fogg . 
Send with out delay warrant of arrest to Bombay . 
Fix , Detective . 
The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous . 
The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber . 
His photograph , which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club , was minutely examined , and it betrayed , feature by feature , the description of the robber which had been provided to the police .
