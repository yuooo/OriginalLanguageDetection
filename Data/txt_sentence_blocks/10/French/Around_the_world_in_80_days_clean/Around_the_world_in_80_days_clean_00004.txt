He lived alone in his house in Saville Row , whither none penetrated . 
A single domestic sufficed to serve him . 
He breakfasted and dined at the club , at hours mathematically fixed , in the same room , at the same table , never taking his meals with other members , much less bringing a guest with him ; and went home at exactly midnight , only to retire at once to bed . 
He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members . 
He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row , either in sleeping or making his toilet . 
When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring , or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns , and illumined by blue painted windows . 
When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club -- its kitchens and pantries , its buttery and dairy -- aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores ; he was served by the gravest waiters , in dress coats , and shoes with swan-skin soles , who proffered the viands in special porcelain , and on the finest linen ; club decanters , of a lost mould , contained his sherry , his port , and his cinnamon-spiced claret ; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice , brought at great cost from the American lakes . 
If to live in this style is to be eccentric , it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity . 
The mansion in Saville Row , though not sumptuous , was exceedingly comfortable . 
The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic , but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular .
