`` Why , '' responded Fix , a little embarrassed , `` I do n't know ; perhaps -- '' `` Ah , if you would only go on with us ! 
An agent of the Peninsular Company , you know , ca n't stop on the way ! 
You were only going to Bombay , and here you are in China . 
America is not far off , and from America to Europe is only a step . '' 
Fix looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him . 
But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation . 
`` Yes , and no , '' returned Fix ; `` there is good and bad luck in such things . 
But you must understand that I do n't travel at my own expense . '' 
`` Oh , I am quite sure of that ! '' 
cried Passepartout , laughing heartily .
