Why has Brigham Young , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ?

Driven from Vermont , driven from Illinois , driven from Ohio , driven from Missouri , driven from Utah , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents .

During the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt Lake . 
Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the Dead Sea , and into which flows an American Jordan . 
It is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .
