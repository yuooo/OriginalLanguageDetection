`` But , Mr. Fogg , '' pursued Sir Francis , `` you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow 's adventure at the pagoda . '' 
Passepartout , his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket , was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him . 
`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence . 
It takes particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , Sir Francis , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to Europe . 
I do n't see how this affair could have delayed his master . '' 
The conversation fell again . 
During the night the train left the mountains behind , and passed Nassik , and the next day proceeded over the flat , well-cultivated country of the Khandeish , with its straggling villages , above which rose the minarets of the pagodas . 
This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams , mostly tributaries of the Godavery . 
Passepartout , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train . 
The locomotive , guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis -LRB- sort of abandoned monasteries -RRB- , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture .
