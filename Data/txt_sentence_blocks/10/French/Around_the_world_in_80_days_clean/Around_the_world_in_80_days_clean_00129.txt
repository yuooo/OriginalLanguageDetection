Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide 's narrative of her touching history . 
She did , indeed , belong to the highest of the native races of India . 
Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton ; and one of them , Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy , was made a baronet by the English government . 
Aouda was a relative of this great man , and it was his cousin , Jeejeeh , whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong . 
Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell ; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties , and to assure her that everything would be mathematically -- he used the very word -- arranged . 
Aouda fastened her great eyes , `` clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya , '' upon him ; but the intractable Fogg , as reserved as ever , did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake . 
The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously , amid favourable weather and propitious winds , and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman , the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal , with its picturesque Saddle Peak , two thousand four hundred feet high , looming above the waters . 
The steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage Papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance . 
The panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb . 
Vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree-like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire .
