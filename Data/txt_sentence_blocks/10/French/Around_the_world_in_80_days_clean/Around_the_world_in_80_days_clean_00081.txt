The Indian had begun already , by often irritating him , and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter , to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature , this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle . 
Happily , however , for Mr. Fogg , the animal 's instruction in this direction had not gone far , and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness . 
Kiouni -- this was the name of the beast -- could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time , and , in default of any other means of conveyance , Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him . 
But elephants are far from cheap in India , where they are becoming scarce , the males , which alone are suitable for circus shows , are much sought , especially as but few of them are domesticated . 
When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni , he refused point-blank . 
Mr. Fogg persisted , offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad . 
Refused . 
Twenty pounds ? 
Refused also . 
Forty pounds ?
