With but its bit of sail , the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . 
To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth . 
The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs . 
Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her ; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her . 
The passengers were often bathed in spray , but they submitted to it philosophically . 
Fix cursed it , no doubt ; but Aouda , with her eyes fastened upon her protector , whose coolness amazed her , showed herself worthy of him , and bravely weathered the storm . 
As for Phileas Fogg , it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme . 
Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north ; but towards evening the wind , veering three quarters , bore down from the north-west . 
The boat , now lying in the trough of the waves , shook and rolled terribly ; the sea struck her with fearful violence . 
At night the tempest increased in violence .
