The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon , in company with Phileas Fogg , gave him new material for reflection . 
Who was this woman ? 
What combination of events had made her Fogg 's travelling companion ? 
They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta ; but where ? 
Had they met accidentally , or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel ? 
Fix was fairly puzzled . 
He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement ; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue . 
Whether the young woman were married or not , he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money . 
But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong ? 
Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another , and , before anything could be effected , might get full under way again for Yokohama .
