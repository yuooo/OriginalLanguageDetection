The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there . 
A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the Sioux attack it . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to the captain , `` three passengers have disappeared . '' 
`` Dead ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` Dead or prisoners ; that is the uncertainty which must be solved . 
Do you propose to pursue the Sioux ? '' 
`` That 's a serious thing to do , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas , and I can not leave the fort unprotected . '' 
`` The lives of three men are in question , sir , '' said Phileas Fogg .
