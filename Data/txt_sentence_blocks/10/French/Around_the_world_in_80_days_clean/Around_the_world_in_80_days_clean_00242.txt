The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear . 
This happened , indeed , to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling . 
About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track . 
The locomotive , slackening its speed , tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher ; but the mass of animals was too great . 
The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait , uttering now and then deafening bellowings . 
There was no use of interrupting them , for , having taken a particular direction , nothing can moderate and change their course ; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain . 
The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms ; but Phileas Fogg , who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry , remained in his seat , and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way . 
Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned , and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them . 
`` What a country ! '' 
cried he .
