`` Well , Ralph , '' said Thomas Flanagan , `` what about that robbery ? '' 
`` Oh , '' replied Stuart , `` the Bank will lose the money . '' 
`` On the contrary , '' broke in Ralph , `` I hope we may put our hands on the robber . 
Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent , and he 'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers . '' 
`` But have you got the robber 's description ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` In the first place , he is no robber at all , '' returned Ralph , positively . 
`` What ! 
a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds , no robber ? '' 
`` No . ''
