The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch . 
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club . 
John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , the bankers , Andrew Stuart , the engineer , Gauthier Ralph , the director of the Bank of England , and Thomas Flanagan , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously . 
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , Andrew Stuart got up , saying , `` Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired . '' 
`` What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool ? '' 
asked Thomas Flanagan . 
`` At twenty-three minutes past seven , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve . '' 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' resumed Andrew Stuart , `` if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train , he would have got here by this time . 
We can , therefore , regard the bet as won . '' 
`` Wait ; do n't let us be too hasty , '' replied Samuel Fallentin .
