This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office . 
Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia . 
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . 
But Fix 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia . 
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer . 
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road . 
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay . 
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance .
