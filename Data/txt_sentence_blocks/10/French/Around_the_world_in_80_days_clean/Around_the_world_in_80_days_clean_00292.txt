Fix had heard this conversation . 
A little while before , when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey , he had made up his mind to leave Fort Kearney ; but now that the train was there , ready to start , and he had only to take his seat in the car , an irresistible influence held him back . 
The station platform burned his feet , and he could not stir . 
The conflict in his mind again began ; anger and failure stifled him . 
He wished to struggle on to the end . 
Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded , among them Colonel Proctor , whose injuries were serious , had taken their places in the train . 
The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves . 
The engineer whistled , the train started , and soon disappeared , mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow . 
The detective had remained behind . 
Several hours passed .
