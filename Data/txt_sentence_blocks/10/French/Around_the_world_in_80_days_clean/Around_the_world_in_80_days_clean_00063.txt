Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place , and thought that , with its circular walls and dismantled fort , it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer . 
The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears , and the next day they put in at Steamer Point , north-west of Aden harbour , to take in coal . 
This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines ; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year . 
In these distant seas , coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton . 
The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up . 
But this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect Phileas Fogg 's programme ; besides , the Mongolia , instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours . 
Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed ; Fix , unobserved , followed them . 
The visa procured , Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while Passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of Somanlis , Banyans , Parsees , Jews , Arabs , and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden . 
He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean , and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon . 
`` Very curious , very curious , '' said Passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer .
