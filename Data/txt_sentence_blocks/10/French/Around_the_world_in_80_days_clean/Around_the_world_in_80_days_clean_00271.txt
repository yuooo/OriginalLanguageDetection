`` When and where you will , '' replied the American , `` and with whatever weapon you choose . '' 
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his . 
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . 
Phileas Fogg left the car , and the American followed him upon the platform . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to his adversary , `` I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . '' 
`` Well , what 's that to me ? '' 
replied Colonel Proctor . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , very politely , `` after our meeting at San Francisco , I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England . '' 
`` Really ! '' 
`` Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ? ''
