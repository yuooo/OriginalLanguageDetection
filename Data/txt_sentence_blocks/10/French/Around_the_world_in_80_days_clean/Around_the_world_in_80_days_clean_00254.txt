`` Well , reassure yourself , madam ; before he settles with Mr. Fogg ; he has got to deal with me ! 
It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two . '' 
`` And , besides , '' added Passepartout , `` I 'll take charge of him , colonel as he is . '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' resumed Aouda , `` Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him . 
He said that he would come back to America to find this man . 
Should he perceive Colonel Proctor , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results . 
He must not see him . '' 
`` You are right , madam , '' replied Fix ; `` a meeting between them might ruin all . 
Whether he were victorious or beaten , Mr. Fogg would be delayed , and -- '' `` And , '' added Passepartout , `` that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club .
