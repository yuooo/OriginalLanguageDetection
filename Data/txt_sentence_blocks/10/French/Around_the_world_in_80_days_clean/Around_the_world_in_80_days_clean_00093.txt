exclaimed Passepartout , `` to be burned alive ! '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Sir Francis , `` burned alive . 
And , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . 
They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . 
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . 
Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it . 
Several years ago , when I was living at Bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . 
The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose . '' 
While Sir Francis was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said : `` The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one . '' 
`` How do you know ? ''
