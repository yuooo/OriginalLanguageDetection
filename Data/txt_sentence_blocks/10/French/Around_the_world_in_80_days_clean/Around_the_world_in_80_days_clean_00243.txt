`` Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel ! 
Parbleu ! 
I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme ! 
And here 's an engineer who does n't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts ! '' 
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise . 
He would have crushed the first buffaloes , no doubt , with the cow-catcher ; but the locomotive , however powerful , would soon have been checked , the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track , and would then have been helpless . 
The best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed . 
The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear . 
The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon . 
It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the Humboldt Range , and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah , the region of the Great Salt Lake , the singular colony of the Mormons .
