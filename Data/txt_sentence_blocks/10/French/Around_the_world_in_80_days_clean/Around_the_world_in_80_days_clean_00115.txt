`` I am he . '' 
`` Is this man your servant ? '' 
added the policeman , pointing to Passepartout . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Be so good , both of you , as to follow me . '' 
Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever . 
The policeman was a representative of the law , and law is sacred to an Englishman . 
Passepartout tried to reason about the matter , but the policeman tapped him with his stick , and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey . 
`` May this young lady go with us ? '' 
asked he .
