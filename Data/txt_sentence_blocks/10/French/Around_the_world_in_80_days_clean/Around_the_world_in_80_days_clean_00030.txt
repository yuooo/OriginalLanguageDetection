Master and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross . 
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight . 
Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms . 
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , `` Here , my good woman . 
I 'm glad that I met you ; '' and passed on . 
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart . 
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased , Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the Reform . 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . '' 
`` Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , Mr. Fogg , '' said Ralph politely . 
`` We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . ''
