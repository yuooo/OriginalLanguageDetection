cried Passepartout , in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him . 
The confusion of master and man , who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay , for which they were now detained at Calcutta , may be imagined . 
Fix the detective , had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout 's escapade gave him , and , delaying his departure for twelve hours , had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill . 
Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour , he promised them a goodly sum in damages , and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train . 
Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow , Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant , the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive . 
Fix 's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined . 
He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces . 
For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety ; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive , accompanied by a young woman , whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain . 
He hastened for a policeman ; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah . 
Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied , he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room , watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood ; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta , as it had done at Bombay and Suez .
