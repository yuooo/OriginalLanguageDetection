Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg 's eyes . 
What was this cool Englishman thinking of ? 
Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice , and boldly snatch her from her executioners ? 
This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool . 
Sir Francis consented , however , to remain to the end of this terrible drama . 
The guide led them to the rear of the glade , where they were able to observe the sleeping groups . 
Meanwhile Passepartout , who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree , was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash , and which was now firmly lodged in his brain . 
He had commenced by saying to himself , `` What folly ! '' 
and then he repeated , `` Why not , after all ? 
It 's a chance perhaps the only one ; and with such sots ! ''
