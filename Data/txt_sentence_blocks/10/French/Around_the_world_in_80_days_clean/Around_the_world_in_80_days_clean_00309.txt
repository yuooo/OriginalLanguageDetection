Mr. Fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the Cunard pier , only said : `` We will consult about what is best to-morrow . 
Come . '' 
The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat , and drove in a carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel , on Broadway . 
Rooms were engaged , and the night passed , briefly to Phileas Fogg , who slept profoundly , but very long to Aouda and the others , whose agitation did not permit them to rest . 
The next day was the 12th of December . 
From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes . 
If Phileas Fogg had left in the China , one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic , he would have reached Liverpool , and then London , within the period agreed upon . 
Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone , after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . 
He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . 
Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .
