Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt ; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin . 
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail . 
Aouda was safe ; and Phileas Fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . 
Fix was slightly wounded in the arm . 
But Passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down Aouda 's cheeks . 
All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood . 
From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh . 
As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible . 
The last Sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of Republican River . 
Mr. Fogg , with folded arms , remained motionless .
