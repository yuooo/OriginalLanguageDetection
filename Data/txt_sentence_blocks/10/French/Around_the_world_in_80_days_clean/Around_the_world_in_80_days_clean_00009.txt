As for Passepartout , he was a true Parisian of Paris . 
Since he had abandoned his own country for England , taking service as a valet , he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart . 
Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air ; he was an honest fellow , with a pleasant face , lips a trifle protruding , soft-mannered and serviceable , with a good round head , such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend . 
His eyes were blue , his complexion rubicund , his figure almost portly and well-built , his body muscular , and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days . 
His brown hair was somewhat tumbled ; for , while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva 's tresses , Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own : three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet . 
It would be rash to predict how Passepartout 's lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg . 
It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required ; experience alone could solve the question . 
Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years , and now yearned for repose ; but so far he had failed to find it , though he had already served in ten English houses . 
But he could not take root in any of these ; with chagrin , he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular , constantly running about the country , or on the look-out for adventure . 
His last master , young Lord Longferry , Member of Parliament , after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns , was too often brought home in the morning on policemen 's shoulders .
