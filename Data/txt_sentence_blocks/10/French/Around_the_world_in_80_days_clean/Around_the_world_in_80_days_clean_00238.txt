It is now accomplished in seven days . 
It was in 1862 that , in spite of the Southern Members of Congress , who wished a more southerly route , it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels . 
President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha , in Nebraska . 
The work was at once commenced , and pursued with true American energy ; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution . 
The road grew , on the prairies , a mile and a half a day . 
A locomotive , running on the rails laid down the evening before , brought the rails to be laid on the morrow , and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position . 
The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa , Kansas , Colorado , and Oregon . 
On leaving Omaha , it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch , follows its southern branch , crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains , turns the Great Salt Lake , and reaches Salt Lake City , the Mormon capital , plunges into the Tuilla Valley , across the American Desert , Cedar and Humboldt Mountains , the Sierra Nevada , and descends , via Sacramento , to the Pacific -- its grade , even on the Rocky Mountains , never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile . 
Such was the road to be traversed in seven days , which would enable Phileas Fogg -- at least , so he hoped -- to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool . 
The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels , and with no compartments in the interior .
