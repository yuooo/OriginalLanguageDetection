`` The election of a general-in-chief , no doubt ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` No , sir ; of a justice of the peace . '' 
Phileas Fogg got into the train , which started off at full speed . 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD `` From ocean to ocean '' -- so say the Americans ; and these four words compose the general designation of the `` great trunk line '' which crosses the entire width of the United States . 
The Pacific Railroad is , however , really divided into two distinct lines : the Central Pacific , between San Francisco and Ogden , and the Union Pacific , between Ogden and Omaha . 
Five main lines connect Omaha with New York . 
New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles . 
Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts , and a large tract which the Mormons , after they were driven from Illinois in 1845 , began to colonise . 
The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months .
