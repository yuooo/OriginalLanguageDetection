`` A magnificent robbery , consul ; fifty-five thousand pounds ! 
We do n't often have such windfalls . 
Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays ! 
A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said the consul , `` I like your way of talking , and hope you 'll succeed ; but I fear you will find it far from easy . 
Do n't you see , the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man ? '' 
`` Consul , '' remarked the detective , dogmatically , `` great robbers always resemble honest folks . 
Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take , and that is to remain honest ; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand . 
The artistic thing is , to unmask honest countenances ; it 's no light task , I admit , but a real art . '' 
Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit .
