Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction ; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week , it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive . 
Passepartout was stupefied . 
This sentence ruined his master . 
A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda ! 
Phileas Fogg , as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him , did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced . 
Just as the clerk was calling the next case , he rose , and said , `` I offer bail . '' 
`` You have that right , '' returned the judge . 
Fix 's blood ran cold , but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds . 
`` I will pay it at once , '' said Mr. Fogg , taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag , which Passepartout had by him , and placing them on the clerk 's desk . 
`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge .
