With his hair in disorder , and without his hat , he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before , overturning passers-by , rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout . 
In three minutes he was in Saville Row again , and staggered back into Mr. Fogg 's room . 
He could not speak . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` My master ! '' 
gasped Passepartout -- `` marriage -- impossible -- '' `` Impossible ? '' 
`` Impossible -- for to-morrow . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because to-morrow -- is Sunday ! ''
