Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again , and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world , and have a good laugh over it ? 
No doubt ; at least , it was worth considering . 
The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg , and apologise for his singular behaviour . 
Passepartout got up and proceeded , as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer , to the after-deck . 
He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda . 
`` Good ! '' 
muttered he ; `` Aouda has not got up yet , and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist . '' 
He descended to the saloon . 
Mr. Fogg was not there . 
Passepartout had only , however , to ask the purser the number of his master 's state-room .
