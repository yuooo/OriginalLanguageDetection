A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties , during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure . 
He certainly did not bet to win , and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds , half of his fortune , because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult , not to say unattainable , project . 
As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend . 
The clock struck seven , and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure . 
`` I am quite ready now , '' was his tranquil response . 
`` Diamonds are trumps : be so good as to play , gentlemen . '' 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT , HIS SERVANT Having won twenty guineas at whist , and taken leave of his friends , Phileas Fogg , at twenty-five minutes past seven , left the Reform Club . 
Passepartout , who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties , was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour ; for , according to rule , he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom , and called out , `` Passepartout ! ''
