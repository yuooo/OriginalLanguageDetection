But , though I found you out some time ago , I 've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg . '' 
`` He knows nothing , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Passepartout , again emptying his glass . 
The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again .

Passepartout 's mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult . 
It was evident that the servant was not the master 's accomplice , as Fix had been inclined to suspect . 
`` Well , '' said the detective to himself , `` as he is not an accomplice , he will help me . '' 
He had no time to lose : Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it . 
`` Listen to me , '' said Fix abruptly .
