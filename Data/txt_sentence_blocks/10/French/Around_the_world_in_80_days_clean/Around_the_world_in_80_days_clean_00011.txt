It comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the Reform Club -- all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten . 
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired . 
Mr. Fogg 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste . 
Each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes . 
In short , the house in Saville Row , which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan , was cosiness , comfort , and method idealised . 
There was no study , nor were there books , which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg ; for at the Reform two libraries , one of general literature and the other of law and politics , were at his service . 
A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom , constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars ; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere ; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits . 
Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom , he rubbed his hands , a broad smile overspread his features , and he said joyfully , `` This is just what I wanted ! 
Ah , we shall get on together , Mr. Fogg and I ! 
What a domestic and regular gentleman !
