They were surrounded by men , women , and children , who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm , interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals ; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels , the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other . 
Upon the car , which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus , stood a hideous statue with four arms , the body coloured a dull red , with haggard eyes , dishevelled hair , protruding tongue , and lips tinted with betel . 
It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant . 
Sir Francis , recognising the statue , whispered , `` The goddess Kali ; the goddess of love and death . '' 
`` Of death , perhaps , '' muttered back Passepartout , `` but of love -- that ugly old hag ? 
Never ! '' 
The Parsee made a motion to keep silence . 
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great Indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut . 
Some Brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . 
This woman was young , and as fair as a European .
