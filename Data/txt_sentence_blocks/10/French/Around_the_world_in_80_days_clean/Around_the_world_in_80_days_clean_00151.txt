He found himself , then , about twenty-four hours behind-hand , thirty-five days after leaving London . 
The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning . 
Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there , which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative . 
On landing , he conducted her to a palanquin , in which they repaired to the Club Hotel . 
A room was engaged for the young woman , and Mr. Fogg , after seeing that she wanted for nothing , set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh . 
He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return , that Aouda might not be left entirely alone . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange , where , he did not doubt , every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant . 
Meeting a broker , he made the inquiry , to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before , and , retiring from business with an immense fortune , had taken up his residence in Europe -- in Holland the broker thought , with the merchants of which country he had principally traded . 
Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel , begged a moment 's conversation with Aouda , and without more ado , apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong , but probably in Holland . 
Aouda at first said nothing .
