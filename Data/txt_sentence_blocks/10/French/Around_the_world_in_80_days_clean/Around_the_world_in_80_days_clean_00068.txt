Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg , and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police . 
He made himself known as a London detective , told his business at Bombay , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London . 
It had not reached the office ; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive . 
Fix was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police . 
This the director refused , as the matter concerned the London office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant . 
Fix did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay . 
He did not doubt for a moment , any more than Passepartout , that Phileas Fogg would remain there , at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive . 
Passepartout , however , had no sooner heard his master 's orders on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris , and that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta , and perhaps beyond that place . 
He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest , and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him , despite his love of repose , around the world in eighty days ! 
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes , he took a leisurely promenade about the streets , where crowds of people of many nationalities -- Europeans , Persians with pointed caps , Banyas with round turbans , Sindes with square bonnets , Parsees with black mitres , and long-robed Armenians -- were collected .
