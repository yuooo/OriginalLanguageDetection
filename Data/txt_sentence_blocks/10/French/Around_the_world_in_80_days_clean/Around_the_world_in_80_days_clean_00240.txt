Snow began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect . 
At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived ; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory . 
The backs of the seats were thrown back , bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system , berths were suddenly improvised , and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed , protected from curious eyes by thick curtains . 
The sheets were clean and the pillows soft . 
It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did -- while the train sped on across the State of California . 
The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly . 
The Central Pacific , taking Sacramento for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha . 
The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction , along the American River , which empties into San Pablo Bay . 
The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours , and towards midnight , while fast asleep , the travellers passed through Sacramento ; so that they saw nothing of that important place , the seat of the State government , with its fine quays , its broad streets , its noble hotels , squares , and churches . 
The train , on leaving Sacramento , and passing the junction , Roclin , Auburn , and Colfax , entered the range of the Sierra Nevada .
