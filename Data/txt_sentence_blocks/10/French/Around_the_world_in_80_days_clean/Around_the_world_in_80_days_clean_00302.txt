What a journey ! 
The travellers , huddled close together , could not speak for the cold , intensified by the rapidity at which they were going . 
The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves . 
When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails . 
Mudge , who was at the rudder , kept in a straight line , and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make . 
All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine . 
A top-mast was hoisted , and another jib , held out to the wind , added its force to the other sails . 
Although the speed could not be exactly estimated , the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour . 
`` If nothing breaks , '' said Mudge , `` we shall get there ! '' 
Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge 's interest to reach Omaha within the time agreed on , by the offer of a handsome reward .
