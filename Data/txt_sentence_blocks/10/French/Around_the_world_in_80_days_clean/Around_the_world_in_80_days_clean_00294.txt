Absolute silence rested on the plains . 
Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm . 
Throughout the night Aouda , full of sad forebodings , her heart stifled with anguish , wandered about on the verge of the plains . 
Her imagination carried her far off , and showed her innumerable dangers . 
What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe . 
Fix remained stationary in the same place , but did not sleep . 
Once a man approached and spoke to him , and the detective merely replied by shaking his head . 
Thus the night passed . 
At dawn , the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon ; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off . 
Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy .
