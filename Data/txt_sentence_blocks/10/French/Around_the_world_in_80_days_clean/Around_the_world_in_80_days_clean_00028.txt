No . 
Was this a joke , then ? 
They were going to Dover ; good ! 
To Calais ; good again ! 
After all , Passepartout , who had been away from France five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again . 
Perhaps they would go as far as Paris , and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more . 
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there ; no doubt -- but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto ! 
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself ; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to Mr. Fogg . 
Mr. Fogg was quite ready . 
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw 's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways .
