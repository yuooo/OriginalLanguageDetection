Passepartout did not reply . 
It could not be he who was called ; it was not the right hour . 
`` Passepartout ! '' 
repeated Mr. Fogg , without raising his voice . 
Passepartout made his appearance . 
`` I 've called you twice , '' observed his master . 
`` But it is not midnight , '' responded the other , showing his watch . 
`` I know it ; I do n't blame you . 
We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes . '' 
A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout 's round face ; clearly he had not comprehended his master .
