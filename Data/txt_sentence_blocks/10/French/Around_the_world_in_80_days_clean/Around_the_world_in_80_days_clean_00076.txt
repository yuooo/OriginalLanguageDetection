It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one . 
The train stopped , at eight o'clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal , where there were several bungalows , and workmen 's cabins . 
The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , `` Passengers will get out here ! '' 
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias . 
Passepartout , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying : `` Monsieur , no more railway ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` I mean to say that the train is n't going on . '' 
The general at once stepped out , while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor . 
`` Where are we ? ''
