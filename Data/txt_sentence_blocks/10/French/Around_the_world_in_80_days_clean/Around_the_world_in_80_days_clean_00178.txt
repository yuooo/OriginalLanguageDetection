`` If it would not put your honour out -- '' `` Here are two hundred pounds on account sir , '' added Phileas Fogg , turning to Fix , `` if you would like to take advantage -- '' `` Thanks , sir ; I was about to ask the favour . '' 
`` Very well . 
In half an hour we shall go on board . '' 
`` But poor Passepartout ? '' 
urged Aouda , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance . 
`` I shall do all I can to find him , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
While Fix , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong . 
Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout 's description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him . 
The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf . 
It was now three o'clock ; and pilot-boat No. 43 , with its crew on board , and its provisions stored away , was ready for departure .
