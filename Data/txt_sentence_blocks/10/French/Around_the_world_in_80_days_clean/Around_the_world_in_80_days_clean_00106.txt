The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg , and , in an abrupt tone , said , `` Let us be off ! '' 
It was Passepartout himself , who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and , profiting by the still overhanging darkness , had delivered the young woman from death ! 
It was Passepartout who , playing his part with a happy audacity , had passed through the crowd amid the general terror . 
A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace . 
But the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg 's hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered . 
The old rajah 's body , indeed , now appeared upon the burning pyre ; and the priests , recovered from their terror , perceived that an abduction had taken place . 
They hastened into the forest , followed by the soldiers , who fired a volley after the fugitives ; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them , and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows . 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DESCENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF THE GANGES WITHOUT EVER THINKING OF SEEING IT The rash exploit had been accomplished ; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success . 
Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow 's hand , and his master said , `` Well done ! '' 
which , from him , was high commendation ; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg .
