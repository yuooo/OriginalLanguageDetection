`` Stay , '' replied Mr. Fogg calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune . 
Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails . 
These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start ; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats , and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers . 
Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way . 
Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening . 
The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning , it then being high tide ; and Phileas Fogg , after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for . 
The party went on shore at once . 
Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot ; but he did not . 
Why ? 
What struggle was going on within him ?
