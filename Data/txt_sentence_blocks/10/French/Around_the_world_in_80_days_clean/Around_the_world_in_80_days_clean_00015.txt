He took it up , scrutinised it , passed it to his neighbour , he to the next man , and so on until the ingot , going from hand to hand , was transferred to the end of a dark entry ; nor did it return to its place for half an hour . 
Meanwhile , the cashier had not so much as raised his head . 
But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly . 
The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the `` drawing office , '' the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss . 
As soon as the robbery was discovered , picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool , Glasgow , Havre , Suez , Brindisi , New York , and other ports , inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds , and five per cent . 
on the sum that might be recovered . 
Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail , and a judicial examination was at once entered upon . 
There were real grounds for supposing , as the Daily Telegraph said , that the thief did not belong to a professional band . 
On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners , and with a well-to-do air , had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed . 
A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives ; and some hopeful spirits , of whom Ralph was one , did not despair of his apprehension .
