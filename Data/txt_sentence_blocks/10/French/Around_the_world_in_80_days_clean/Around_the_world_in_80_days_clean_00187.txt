John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens , muttering indistinctly between his teeth . 
At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg , `` Shall I speak out to your honour ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` Well , we are going to have a squall . '' 
`` Is the wind north or south ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg quietly . 
`` South . 
Look ! 
a typhoon is coming up . '' 
`` Glad it 's a typhoon from the south , for it will carry us forward . ''
