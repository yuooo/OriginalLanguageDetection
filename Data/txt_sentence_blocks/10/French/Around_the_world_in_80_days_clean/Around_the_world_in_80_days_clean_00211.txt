`` Then you ought to know how to make grimaces ? '' 
`` Why , '' replied Passepartout , a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question , `` we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces , it is true but not any better than the Americans do . '' 
`` True . 
Well , if I ca n't take you as a servant , I can as a clown . 
You see , my friend , in France they exhibit foreign clowns , and in foreign parts French clowns . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` You are pretty strong , eh ? '' 
`` Especially after a good meal . '' 
`` And you can sing ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Passepartout , who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets .
