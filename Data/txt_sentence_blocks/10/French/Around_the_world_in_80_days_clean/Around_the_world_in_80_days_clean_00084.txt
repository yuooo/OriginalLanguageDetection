IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS VENTURE ACROSS THE INDIAN FORESTS , AND WHAT ENSUED In order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built . 
This line , owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains , did not pursue a straight course . 
The Parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them , were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant , spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee ; but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm , talking little , and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other . 
As for Passepartout , who was mounted on the beast 's back , and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along , he was very careful , in accordance with his master 's advice , to keep his tongue from between his teeth , as it would otherwise have been bitten off short . 
The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant 's neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board ; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in Kiouni 's trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot . 
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which Kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . 
Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . 
`` Why , he 's made of iron ! '' 
exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on Kiouni .
