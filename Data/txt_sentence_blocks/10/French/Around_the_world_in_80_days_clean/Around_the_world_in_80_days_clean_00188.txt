`` Oh , if you take it that way , '' said John Bunsby , `` I 've nothing more to say . '' 
John Bunsby 's suspicions were confirmed . 
At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon , according to a famous meteorologist , would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame ; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence . 
The pilot took his precautions in advance . 
He reefed all sail , the pole-masts were dispensed with ; all hands went forward to the bows . 
A single triangular sail , of strong canvas , was hoisted as a storm-jib , so as to hold the wind from behind . 
Then they waited . 
John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant . 
Neither Mr. Fogg , Fix , nor Aouda consented to leave the deck . 
The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock .
