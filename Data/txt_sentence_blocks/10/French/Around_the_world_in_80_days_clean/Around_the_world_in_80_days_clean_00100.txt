The time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda . 
They waited till midnight ; but no change took place among the guards , and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on . 
The other plan must be carried out ; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made . 
It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door . 
After a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others . 
They took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear . 
They reached the walls about half-past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors . 
The night was dark . 
The moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness . 
It was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives .
