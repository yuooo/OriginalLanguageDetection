But , as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery , Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix 's movements , which was in truth far from unreasonable . 
Fix , he thought , could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg 's friends at the Reform Club , sent to follow him up , and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon . 
`` It 's clear ! '' 
repeated the worthy servant to himself , proud of his shrewdness . 
`` He 's a spy sent to keep us in view ! 
That is n't quite the thing , either , to be spying Mr. Fogg , who is so honourable a man ! 
Ah , gentlemen of the Reform , this shall cost you dear ! '' 
Passepartout , enchanted with his discovery , resolved to say nothing to his master , lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries . 
But he determined to chaff Fix , when he had the chance , with mysterious allusions , which , however , need not betray his real suspicions . 
During the afternoon of Wednesday , 30th October , the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca , which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra .
