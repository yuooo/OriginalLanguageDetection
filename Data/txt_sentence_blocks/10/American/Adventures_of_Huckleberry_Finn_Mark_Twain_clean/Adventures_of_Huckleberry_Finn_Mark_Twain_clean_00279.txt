Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt . 
Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly . 
The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn . 
He lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and so on . 
The people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout . 
Then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in earnest , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then a-leaning down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , `` It 's the brazen serpent in the wilderness ! 
Look upon it and live ! '' 
And people would shout out , `` Glory ! 
-- A-a-MEN ! '' 
And so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : `` Oh , come to the mourners ' bench !
