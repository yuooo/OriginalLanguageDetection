So Jim he said it was all right , and we set there and talked over old times awhile , and then Tom asked a lot of questions , and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him , and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat , and both of them was kind as they could be , Tom says : `` NOW I know how to fix it . 
We 'll send you some things by them . '' 
I said , `` Do n't do nothing of the kind ; it 's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck ; '' but he never paid no attention to me ; went right on . 
It was his way when he 'd got his plans set . 
So he told Jim how we 'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat , the nigger that fed him , and he must be on the lookout , and not be surprised , and not let Nat see him open them ; and we would put small things in uncle 's coat-pockets and he must steal them out ; and we would tie things to aunt 's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket , if we got a chance ; and told him what they would be and what they was for . 
And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood , and all that . 
He told him everything . 
Jim he could n't see no sense in the most of it , but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ; so he was satisfied , and said he would do it all just as Tom said . 
Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco ; so we had a right down good sociable time ; then we crawled out through the hole , and so home to bed , with hands that looked like they 'd been chawed . 
Tom was in high spirits .
