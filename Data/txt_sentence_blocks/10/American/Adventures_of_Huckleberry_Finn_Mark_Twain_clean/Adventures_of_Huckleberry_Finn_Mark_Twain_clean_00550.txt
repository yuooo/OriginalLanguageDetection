`` You do n't KNOW ? 
Do n't answer me that way . 
Tom , I want to know what you been DOING down there . '' 
`` I hai n't been doing a single thing , Aunt Sally , I hope to gracious if I have . '' 
I reckoned she 'd let me go now , and as a generl thing she would ; but I s ` pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that war n't yard-stick straight ; so she says , very decided : `` You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come . 
You been up to something you no business to , and I lay I 'll find out what it is before I 'M done with you . '' 
So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room . 
My , but there was a crowd there ! 
Fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun .
