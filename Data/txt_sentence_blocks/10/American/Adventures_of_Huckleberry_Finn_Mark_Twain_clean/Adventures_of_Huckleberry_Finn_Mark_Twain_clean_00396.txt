A body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , ` Why , he stumped his TOE . ' 
Would ther ' be any sense in that ? 
NO . 
And ther ' ai n't no sense in THIS , nuther . 
Is it ketching ? '' 
`` Is it KETCHING ? 
Why , how you talk . 
Is a HARROW catching -- in the dark ? 
If you do n't hitch on to one tooth , you 're bound to on another , ai n't you ? 
And you ca n't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along , can you ?
