So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting . 
We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day . 
There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around . 
The woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies . 
There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck . 
The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people . 
The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs . 
They did n't have no backs . 
The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds . 
The women had on sun-bonnets ; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico .
