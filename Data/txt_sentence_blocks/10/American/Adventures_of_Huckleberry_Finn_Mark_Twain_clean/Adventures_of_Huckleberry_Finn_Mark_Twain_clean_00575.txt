`` Good land ! 
Set the run -- What IS the child talking about ! 
Dear , dear , out of his head again ! '' 
`` NO , I ai n't out of my HEAD ; I know all what I 'm talking about . 
We DID set him free -- me and Tom . 
We laid out to do it , and we DONE it . 
And we done it elegant , too . '' 
He 'd got a start , and she never checked him up , just set and stared and stared , and let him clip along , and I see it war n't no use for ME to put in . 
`` Why , Aunty , it cost us a power of work -- weeks of it -- hours and hours , every night , whilst you was all asleep . 
And we had to steal candles , and the sheet , and the shirt , and your dress , and spoons , and tin plates , and case-knives , and the warming-pan , and the grindstone , and flour , and just no end of things , and you ca n't think what work it was to make the saws , and pens , and inscriptions , and one thing or another , and you ca n't think HALF the fun it was .
