Then I see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time I was right . 
It was the raft . 
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar . 
The other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt . 
So she 'd had a rough time . 
I made fast and laid down under Jim 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against Jim , and says : `` Hello , Jim , have I been asleep ? 
Why did n't you stir me up ? '' 
`` Goodness gracious , is dat you , Huck ? 
En you ain ' dead -- you ain ' drownded -- you 's back agin ? 
It 's too good for true , honey , it 's too good for true .
