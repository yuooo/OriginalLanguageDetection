I see it war n't a bit of use to try to go ahead -- I 'd got to throw up my hand . 
So I says to myself , here 's another place where I got to resk the truth . 
I opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : `` Here he comes ! 
Stick your head down lower -- there , that 'll do ; you ca n't be seen now . 
Do n't you let on you 're here . 
I 'll play a joke on him . 
Children , do n't you say a word . '' 
I see I was in a fix now . 
But it war n't no use to worry ; there war n't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck . 
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him .
