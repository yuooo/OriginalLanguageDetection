Then he weaves along again , perfectly ca 'm , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before . 
And when he done it the third time he says : `` I say orgies , not because it 's the common term , because it ai n't -- obsequies bein ' the common term -- but because orgies is the right term . 
Obsequies ai n't used in England no more now -- it 's gone out . 
We say orgies now in England . 
Orgies is better , because it means the thing you 're after more exact . 
It 's a word that 's made up out 'n the Greek ORGO , outside , open , abroad ; and the Hebrew JEESUM , to plant , cover up ; hence inTER . 
So , you see , funeral orgies is an open er public funeral . ''

Well , the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face . 
Everybody was shocked .
