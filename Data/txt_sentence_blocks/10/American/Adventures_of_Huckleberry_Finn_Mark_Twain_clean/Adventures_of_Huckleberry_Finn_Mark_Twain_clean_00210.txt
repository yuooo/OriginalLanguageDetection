I begun to suspicion something . 
So did Jim . 
I says : `` Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night . '' 
He says : `` Doan ' le 's talk about it , Huck . 
Po ' niggers ca n't have no luck . 
I awluz ` spected dat rattlesnake-skin war n't done wid its work . '' 
`` I wish I 'd never seen that snake-skin , Jim -- I do wish I 'd never laid eyes on it . '' 
`` It ai n't yo ' fault , Huck ; you didn ' know . 
Do n't you blame yo ` self ` bout it . '' 
When it was daylight , here was the clear Ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular Muddy !
