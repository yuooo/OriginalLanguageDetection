What we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the REST of the town ! 
Then we 'll all be in the same boat . 
Ai n't that sensible ? '' 
-LRB- `` You bet it is ! 
-- the jedge is right ! '' 
everybody sings out . -RRB- 
`` All right , then -- not a word about any sell . 
Go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy . '' 
Next day you could n't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was . 
House was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way .
