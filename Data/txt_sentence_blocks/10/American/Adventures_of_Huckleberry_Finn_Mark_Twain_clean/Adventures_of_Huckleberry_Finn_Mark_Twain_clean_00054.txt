His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it . 
And he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time . 
This shook me up considerable , because I did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it . 
Then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them what 's - his-name when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing . 
He said he would like to see the widow get me . 
He said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me . 
That made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; I reckoned I would n't stay on hand till he got that chance . 
The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got . 
There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a four-gallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow . 
I toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
