But I said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure . 
So on we prowled again . 
We struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water . 
When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff , sure enough ! 
I could just barely see her . 
I felt ever so thankful . 
In another second I would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened . 
One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and I thought I was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : `` Heave that blame lantern out o ' sight , Bill ! '' 
He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down . 
It was Packard .
