It was a dreadful thing to see . 
Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another . 
We see we was too late -- could n't do no good . 
We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them . 
So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing . 
But that 's always the way ; it do n't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person 's conscience ai n't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway . 
If I had a yaller dog that did n't know no more than a person 's conscience does I would pison him . 
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person 's insides , and yet ai n't no good , nohow . 
Tom Sawyer he says the same . 
WE stopped talking , and got to thinking .
