Conscience says to me , `` What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ? 
What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ?

THAT 'S what she done . '' 
I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead . 
I fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me . 
We neither of us could keep still . 
Every time he danced around and says , `` Dah 's Cairo ! ''
