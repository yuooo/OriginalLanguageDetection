Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it . 
I thought I was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was ME -- or maybe Jim . 
I was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and sung out and begged me to save their lives -- said they had n't been doing nothing , and was being chased for it -- said there was men and dogs a-coming . 
They wanted to jump right in , but I says : `` Do n't you do it . 
I do n't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you 've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in -- that 'll throw the dogs off the scent . '' 
They done it , and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting . 
We heard them come along towards the crick , but could n't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe . 
One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers . 
He had an old battered-up slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops , and home-knit galluses -- no , he only had one . 
He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , ratty-looking carpet-bags .
