When he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he war n't quite satisfied yet . 
He says : `` Do n't you play nothing on me , because I would n't on you . 
Honest injun , you ai n't a ghost ? '' 
`` Honest injun , I ai n't , '' I says . 
`` Well -- I -- I -- well , that ought to settle it , of course ; but I ca n't somehow seem to understand it no way . 
Looky here , war n't you ever murdered AT ALL ? '' 
`` No . 
I war n't ever murdered at all -- I played it on them . 
You come in here and feel of me if you do n't believe me . '' 
So he done it ; and it satisfied him ; and he was that glad to see me again he did n't know what to do .
