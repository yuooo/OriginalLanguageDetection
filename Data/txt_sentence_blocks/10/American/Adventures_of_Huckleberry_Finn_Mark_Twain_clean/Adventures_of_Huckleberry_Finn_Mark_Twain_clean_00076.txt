I was away below the ferry now . 
I rose up , and there was Jackson 's Island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights . 
There war n't any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now . 
It did n't take me long to get there . 
I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore . 
I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside . 
I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling . 
A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it . 
I watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say , `` Stern oars , there ! 
heave her head to stabboard ! ''
