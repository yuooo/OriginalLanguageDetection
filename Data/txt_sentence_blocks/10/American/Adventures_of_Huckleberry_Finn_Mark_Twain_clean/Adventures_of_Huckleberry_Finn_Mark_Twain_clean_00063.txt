Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and I thought I was gone ; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself . 
Pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me . 
He put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who . 
So he dozed off pretty soon . 
By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun . 
I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then I laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir . 
And how slow and still the time did drag along . 
`` GIT up ! 
What you ` bout ? '' 
I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where I was .
