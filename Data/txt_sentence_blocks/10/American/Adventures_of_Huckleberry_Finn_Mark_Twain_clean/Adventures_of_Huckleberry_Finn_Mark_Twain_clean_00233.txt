Everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was sunshine most always -- I mean he made it seem like good weather . 
When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there would n't nothing go wrong again for a week . 
When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day , and did n't set down again till they had set down . 
Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was , and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom 's and Bob 's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , `` Our duty to you , sir , and madam ; '' and THEY bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and Buck , and we drank to the old people too . 
Bob was the oldest and Tom next -- tall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes . 
They dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad Panama hats . 
Then there was Miss Charlotte ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father . 
She was beautiful . 
So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind . 
She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
