You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . '' 
`` Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude . 
Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin ' , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin ' rightful King of France . '' 
Well , he cried and took on so that me and Jim did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry -- and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too . 
So we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort HIM . 
But he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him `` Your Majesty , '' and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them . 
So Jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t ` other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down . 
This done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable . 
But the duke kind of soured on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke 's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : `` Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft , Bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour ? 
It 'll only make things oncomfortable .
