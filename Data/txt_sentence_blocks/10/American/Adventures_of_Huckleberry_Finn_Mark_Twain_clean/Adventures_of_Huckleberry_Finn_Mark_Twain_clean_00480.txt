He says ; `` Now we 're all right . 
We 'll DIG him out . 
It 'll take about a week ! '' 
Then we started for the house , and I went in the back door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string , they do n't fasten the doors -- but that war n't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer ; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod . 
But after he got up half way about three times , and missed fire and fell every time , and the last time most busted his brains out , he thought he 'd got to give it up ; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck , and this time he made the trip . 
In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it WAS Jim that was being fed . 
The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and Jim 's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house . 
This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread . 
That was to keep witches off . 
He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he did n't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
