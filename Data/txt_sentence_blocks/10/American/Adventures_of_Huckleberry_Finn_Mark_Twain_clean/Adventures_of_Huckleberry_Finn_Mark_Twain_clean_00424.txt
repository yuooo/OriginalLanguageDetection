I wo n't say I war n't goin ' to do it , because I WAS ; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o ' me . '' 
`` It 's a lie ! 
You done it , and you got to SAY you done it , or -- '' The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : '' ` Nough ! 
-- I OWN UP ! '' 
I was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before . 
So the duke took his hands off and says : `` If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you . 
It 's WELL for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted . 
I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father . 
You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em . 
It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage .
