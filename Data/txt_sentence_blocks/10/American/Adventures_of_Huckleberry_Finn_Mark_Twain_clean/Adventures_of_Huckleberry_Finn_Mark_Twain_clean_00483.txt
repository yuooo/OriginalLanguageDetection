`` I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ? '' 
`` What PUT it dar ? 
Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ? '' 
Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : `` Well , that 's mighty curious . 
WHO sung out ? 
WHEN did he sing out ? 
WHAT did he sing out ? '' 
And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , `` Did YOU hear anybody sing out ? '' 
Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : `` No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing . '' 
Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : `` Did you sing out ? ''
