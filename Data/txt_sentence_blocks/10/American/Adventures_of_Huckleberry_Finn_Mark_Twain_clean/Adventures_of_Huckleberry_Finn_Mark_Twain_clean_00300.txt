The streets was full , and everybody was excited . 
Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening . 
One long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a crooked-handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t ` other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood , frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes , and sung out , `` Boggs ! '' 
and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says `` Bang ! '' 
staggered backwards , says `` Bang ! '' 
again , and fell down flat on his back . 
The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened . 
Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him . 
Well , by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched . 
In about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with .
