`` Well , they 've got that ; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it . '' 
`` No , you 're out , there . 
They hai n't got it . '' 
`` Why , who 's got it ? '' 
`` I wish I knowed , but I do n't . 
I HAD it , because I stole it from them ; and I stole it to give to you ; and I know where I hid it , but I 'm afraid it ai n't there no more . 
I 'm awful sorry , Miss Mary Jane , I 'm just as sorry as I can be ; but I done the best I could ; I did honest . 
I come nigh getting caught , and I had to shove it into the first place I come to , and run -- and it war n't a good place . '' 
`` Oh , stop blaming yourself -- it 's too bad to do it , and I wo n't allow it -- you could n't help it ; it was n't your fault . 
Where did you hide it ? ''
