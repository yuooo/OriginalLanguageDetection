Well , everybody WAS in a state of mind now , and they sings out : `` The whole BILIN ' of 'm 's frauds ! 
Le 's duck 'em ! 
le 's drown 'em ! 
le 's ride 'em on a rail ! '' 
and everybody was whooping at once , and there was a rattling powwow . 
But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells , and says : `` Gentlemen -- gentleMEN ! 
Hear me just a word -- just a SINGLE word -- if you PLEASE ! 
There 's one way yet -- let 's go and dig up the corpse and look . '' 
That took them . 
`` Hooray ! ''
