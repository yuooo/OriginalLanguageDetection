Aunt Sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and I found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me . 
And I peeped out , and in a little while Tom 's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth , you know . 
And then she says : `` Yes , you BETTER turn y' r head away -- I would if I was you , Tom . '' 
`` Oh , deary me ! '' 
says Aunt Sally ; `` IS he changed so ? 
Why , that ai n't TOM , it 's Sid ; Tom 's -- Tom 's -- why , where is Tom ? 
He was here a minute ago . '' 
`` You mean where 's Huck FINN -- that 's what you mean ! 
I reckon I hai n't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE him . 
That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do .
