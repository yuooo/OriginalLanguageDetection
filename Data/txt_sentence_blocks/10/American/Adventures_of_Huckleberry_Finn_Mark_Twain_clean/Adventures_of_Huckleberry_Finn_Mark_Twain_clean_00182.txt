That was somebody else 's whoop , or else I was turned around . 
I throwed the paddle down . 
I heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and I kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and I knowed the current had swung the canoe 's head down-stream , and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering . 
I could n't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing do n't look natural nor sound natural in a fog . 
The whooping went on , and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the currrent was tearing by them so swift . 
In another second or two it was solid white and still again . 
I set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and I reckon I did n't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred . 
I just give up then . 
I knowed what the matter was . 
That cut bank was an island , and Jim had gone down t ` other side of it .
