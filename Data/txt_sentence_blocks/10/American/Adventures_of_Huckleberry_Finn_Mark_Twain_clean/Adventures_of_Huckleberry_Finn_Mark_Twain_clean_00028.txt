`` I do n't know . 
How do THEY get them ? '' 
`` Why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the genies come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling , and everything they 're told to do they up and do it . 
They do n't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots , and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it -- or any other man . '' 
`` Who makes them tear around so ? '' 
`` Why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring . 
They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they 've got to do whatever he says . 
If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di ` monds , and fill it full of chewing-gum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor 's daughter from China for you to marry , they 've got to do it -- and they 've got to do it before sun-up next morning , too . 
And more : they 've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand . '' 
`` Well , '' says I , `` I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves ` stead of fooling them away like that .
