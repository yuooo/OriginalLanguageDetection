`` It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars , becuz he 's got to go up the river and ca n't wait . 
Think o ' that , now ! 
You bet I 'D wait , if it was seven year . '' 
`` That 's me , every time , '' says I. `` But maybe his chance ai n't worth no more than that , if he 'll sell it so cheap . 
Maybe there 's something ai n't straight about it . '' 
`` But it IS , though -- straight as a string . 
I see the handbill myself . 
It tells all about him , to a dot -- paints him like a picture , and tells the plantation he 's frum , below NewrLEANS . 
No-sirree-BOB , they ai n't no trouble ` bout THAT speculation , you bet you .
