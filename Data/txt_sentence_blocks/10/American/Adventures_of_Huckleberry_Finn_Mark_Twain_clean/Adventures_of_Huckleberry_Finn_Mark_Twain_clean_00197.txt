it went through me like a shot , and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness . 
Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself . 
He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master would n't sell them , they 'd get an Ab ` litionist to go and steal them . 
It most froze me to hear such talk . 
He would n't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before . 
Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free . 
It was according to the old saying , `` Give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an ell . '' 
Thinks I , this is what comes of my not thinking . 
Here was this nigger , which I had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children -- children that belonged to a man I did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm . 
I was sorry to hear Jim say that , it was such a lowering of him .
