They 've got a good thing here , and they ai n't a-going to leave till they 've played this family and this town for all they 're worth , so I 'll find a chance time enough . 
I 'll steal it and hide it ; and by and by , when I 'm away down the river , I 'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it 's hid . 
But I better hive it tonight if I can , because the doctor maybe has n't let up as much as he lets on he has ; he might scare them out of here yet . 
So , thinks I , I 'll go and search them rooms . 
Upstairs the hall was dark , but I found the duke 's room , and started to paw around it with my hands ; but I recollected it would n't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there . 
But I see I could n't do nothing without a candle , and I das n't light one , of course . 
So I judged I 'd got to do the other thing -- lay for them and eavesdrop . 
About that time I hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed ; I reached for it , but it was n't where I thought it would be ; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane 's frocks , so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still . 
They come in and shut the door ; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed . 
Then I was glad I had n't found the bed when I wanted it .
