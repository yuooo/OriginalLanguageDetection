Then get up my canoe to-morrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island . 
Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man 's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and Jim used to do before .

`` WORK ? 
Why , cert ` nly it would work , like rats a-fighting .

It 's as mild as goose-milk .

I never said nothing , because I war n't expecting nothing different ; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it would n't have none of them objections to it .
