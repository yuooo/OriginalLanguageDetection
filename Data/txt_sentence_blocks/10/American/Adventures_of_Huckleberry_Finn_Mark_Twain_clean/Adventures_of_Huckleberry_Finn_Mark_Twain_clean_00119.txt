So we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it . 
Jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit . 
I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe . 
Jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly . 
I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by I could do pretty well in them , only Jim said I did n't walk like a girl ; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket . 
I took notice , and done better . 
I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark . 
I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town . 
I tied up and started along the bank . 
There was a light burning in a little shanty that had n't been lived in for a long time , and I wondered who had took up quarters there .
