Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by . 
I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom ! 
it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? '' 
`` Hold on , Parker , '' says the other man , `` here 's a twenty to put on the board for me . 
Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you 'll be all right . '' 
`` That 's so , my boy -- good-bye , good-bye . 
If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it . '' 
`` Good-bye , sir , '' says I ; `` I wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it . '' 
They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get STARTED right when he 's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat . 
Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s ` pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
