Confound these ole britches ! 
I reckon I 'd better put 'em on , but I 'd ruther not , it 's so warm . 
Are you all ready ? 
All right . 
Come along , old hoss . '' 
Cold corn-pone , cold corn-beef , butter and buttermilk -- that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever I 've come across yet . 
Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women . 
They all smoked and talked , and I eat and talked . 
The young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs . 
They all asked me questions , and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw , and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and Bill went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and Tom and Mort died , and then there war n't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died I took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how I come to be here .
