`` All ready . '' 
`` Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons ? '' 
`` No , sir ; I never heard of them . '' 
`` Well , that may be so , and it may n't . 
Now , all ready . 
Step forward , George Jackson . 
And mind , do n't you hurry -- come mighty slow . 
If there 's anybody with you , let him keep back -- if he shows himself he 'll be shot . 
Come along now .
