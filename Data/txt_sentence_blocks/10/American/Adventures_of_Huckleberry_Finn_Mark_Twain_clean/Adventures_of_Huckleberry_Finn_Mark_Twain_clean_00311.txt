Then there was a fine time . 
Everybody sings out , `` Sold ! '' 
and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians .

They stopped to listen . 
`` We are sold -- mighty badly sold . 
But we do n't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , I reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live . 
NO .
