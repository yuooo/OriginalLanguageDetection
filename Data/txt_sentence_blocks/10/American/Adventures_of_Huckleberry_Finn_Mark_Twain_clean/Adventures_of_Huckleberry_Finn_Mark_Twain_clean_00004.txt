I could n't stood it much longer . 
Then for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety . 
Miss Watson would say , `` Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; '' and `` Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; '' and pretty soon she would say , `` Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave ? '' 
Then she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there . 
She got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm . 
All I wanted was to go somewheres ; all I wanted was a change , I war n't particular . 
She said it was wicked to say what I said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place . 
Well , I could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so I made up my mind I would n't try for it . 
But I never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good . 
Now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .
