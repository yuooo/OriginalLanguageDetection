I says , now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it . 
So there ai n't no doubt but there is something in that thing -- that is , there 's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it do n't work for me , and I reckon it do n't work for only just the right kind . 
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching . 
The ferryboat was floating with the current , and I allowed I 'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did . 
When she 'd got pretty well along down towards me , I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place . 
Where the log forked I could peep through . 
By and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore . 
Most everybody was on the boat . 
Pap , and Judge Thatcher , and Bessie Thatcher , and Jo Harper , and Tom Sawyer , and his old Aunt Polly , and Sid and Mary , and plenty more . 
Everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : `` Look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he 's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water 's edge .
