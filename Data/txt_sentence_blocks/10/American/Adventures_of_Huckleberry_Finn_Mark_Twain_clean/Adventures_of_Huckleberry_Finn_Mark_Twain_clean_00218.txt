Come slow ; push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeeze in , d' you hear ? '' 
I did n't hurry ; I could n't if I 'd a wanted to . 
I took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only I thought I could hear my heart . 
The dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me . 
When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting . 
I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , `` There , that 's enough -- put your head in . '' 
I done it , but I judged they would take it off . 
The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well . 
The old gentleman says : `` There ; I reckon it 's all right . 
Come in . ''
