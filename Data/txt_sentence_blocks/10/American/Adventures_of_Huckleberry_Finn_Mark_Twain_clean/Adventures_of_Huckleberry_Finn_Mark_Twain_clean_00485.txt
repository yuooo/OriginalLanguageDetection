I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say ! 
I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it DIS time . 
But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's SOT , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth 'n' en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when YOU fine it out en tell um ` bout it , dey doan ' b ` lieve you . '' 
Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : `` I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger . 
If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him . '' 
And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : `` Do n't ever let on to know us . 
And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free . '' 
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then . 
IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place . 
We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : `` Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be .
