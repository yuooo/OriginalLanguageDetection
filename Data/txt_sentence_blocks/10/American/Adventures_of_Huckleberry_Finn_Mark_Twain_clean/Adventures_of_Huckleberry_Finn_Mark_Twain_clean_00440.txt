So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there war n't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake . 
And I 've pegged along ever since , dry as a powder-horn . 
Where 's that ten cents ? 
Give it here . '' 
I had considerable money , so I give him ten cents , but begged him to spend it for something to eat , and give me some , because it was all the money I had , and I had n't had nothing to eat since yesterday . 
He never said nothing . 
The next minute he whirls on me and says : `` Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us ? 
We 'd skin him if he done that ! '' 
`` How can he blow ? 
Hai n't he run off ? ''
