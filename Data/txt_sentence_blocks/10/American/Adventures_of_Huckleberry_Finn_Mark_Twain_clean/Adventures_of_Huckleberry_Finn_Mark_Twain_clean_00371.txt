They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one ; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it , and it was pretty skreeky and colicky , and everybody joined in and sung , and Peter was the only one that had a good thing , according to my notion . 
Then the Reverend Hobson opened up , slow and solemn , and begun to talk ; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ; it was only one dog , but he made a most powerful racket , and he kept it up right along ; the parson he had to stand there , over the coffin , and wait -- you could n't hear yourself think . 
It was right down awkward , and nobody did n't seem to know what to do . 
But pretty soon they see that long - legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say , `` Do n't you worry -- just depend on me . '' 
Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall , just his shoulders showing over the people 's heads . 
So he glided along , and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ; and at last , when he had gone around two sides of the room , he disappears down cellar . 
Then in about two seconds we heard a whack , and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two , and then everything was dead still , and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off . 
In a minute or two here comes this undertaker 's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room , and then rose up , and shaded his mouth with his hands , and stretched his neck out towards the preacher , over the people 's heads , and says , in a kind of a coarse whisper , `` HE HAD A RAT ! '' 
Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place . 
You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people , because naturally they wanted to know .
