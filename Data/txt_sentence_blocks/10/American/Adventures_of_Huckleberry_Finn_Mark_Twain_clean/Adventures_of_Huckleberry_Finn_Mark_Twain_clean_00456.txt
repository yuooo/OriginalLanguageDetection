But there war n't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid , and Mary , and the rest of the tribe . 
But if they was joyful , it war n't nothing to what I was ; for it was like being born again , I was so glad to find out who I was . 
Well , they froze to me for two hours ; and at last , when my chin was so tired it could n't hardly go any more , I had told them more about my family -- I mean the Sawyer family -- than ever happened to any six Sawyer families . 
And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River , and it took us three days to fix it . 
Which was all right , and worked first-rate ; because THEY did n't know but what it would take three days to fix it . 
If I 'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well . 
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other . 
Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river . 
Then I says to myself , s ` pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat ? 
And s ` pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet ?
