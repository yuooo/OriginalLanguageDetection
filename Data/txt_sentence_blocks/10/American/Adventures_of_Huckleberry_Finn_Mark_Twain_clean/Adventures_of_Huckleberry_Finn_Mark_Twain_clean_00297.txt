He cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again , with his gray hair a-flying . 
Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it war n't no use -- up the street he would tear again , and give Sherburn another cussing . 
By and by somebody says : `` Go for his daughter ! 
-- quick , go for his daughter ; sometimes he 'll listen to her . 
If anybody can persuade him , she can . ''

I walked down street a ways and stopped . 
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again , but not on his horse . 
He was a-reeling across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along . 
He was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he war n't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
