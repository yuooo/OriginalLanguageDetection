He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do . 
So Tom says : `` What 's the vittles for ? 
Going to feed the dogs ? '' 
The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : `` Yes , Mars Sid , A dog . 
Cur ` us dog , too . 
Does you want to go en look at ` im ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
I hunched Tom , and whispers : `` You going , right here in the daybreak ? 
THAT war n't the plan . '' 
`` No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan NOW . ''
