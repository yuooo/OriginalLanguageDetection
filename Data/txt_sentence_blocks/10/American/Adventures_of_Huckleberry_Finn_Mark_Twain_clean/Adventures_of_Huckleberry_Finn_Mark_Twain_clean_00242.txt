The Shepherdsons done the same . 
It was pretty ornery preaching -- all about brotherly love , and such-like tiresomeness ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination , and I do n't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet . 
About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull . 
Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep . 
I went up to our room , and judged I would take a nap myself . 
I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if I liked her , and I said I did ; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody , and I said I would . 
Then she said she 'd forgot her Testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody . 
I said I would . 
So I slid out and slipped off up the road , and there war n't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there war n't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer - time because it 's cool . 
If you notice , most folks do n't go to church only when they 've got to ; but a hog is different .
