After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people . 
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me . 
But she would n't . 
She said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more . 
That is just the way with some people . 
They get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it . 
Here she was a-bothering about Moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it . 
And she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself . 
Her sister , Miss Watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spelling - book . 
She worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up .
