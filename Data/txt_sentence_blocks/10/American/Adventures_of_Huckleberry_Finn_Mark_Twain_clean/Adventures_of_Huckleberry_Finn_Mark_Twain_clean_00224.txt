So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it . 
Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was . 
So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : `` Can you spell , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he says . 
`` I bet you ca n't spell my name , '' says I. `` I bet you what you dare I can , '' says he . 
`` All right , '' says I , `` go ahead . '' 
`` G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now , '' he says . 
`` Well , '' says I , `` you done it , but I did n't think you could . 
It ai n't no slouch of a name to spell -- right off without studying . '' 
I set it down , private , because somebody might want ME to spell it next , and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it .
