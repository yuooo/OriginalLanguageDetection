I says yes ; and him and some others laughed , and said , `` Stuff ! '' 
Well , then they sailed in on the general investigation , and there we had it , up and down , hour in , hour out , and nobody never said a word about supper , nor ever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept it up , and kept it up ; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see . 
They made the king tell his yarn , and they made the old gentleman tell his ` n ; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t ` other one lies . 
And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed . 
The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye , and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side . 
I begun to tell about Sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the English Wilkses , and so on ; but I did n't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and Levi Bell , the lawyer , says : `` Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you . 
I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice . 
You do it pretty awkward . '' 
I did n't care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway . 
The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : `` If you 'd been in town at first , Levi Bell -- '' The king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : `` Why , is this my poor dead brother 's old friend that he 's wrote so often about ? ''
