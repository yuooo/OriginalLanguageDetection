If they did n't find them -- I could n't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , I could n't think about nothing else . 
It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip . 
He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up . 
When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow . 
And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody had n't thought to fetch a lantern . 
But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning , and sent a man to the nearest house , a half a mile off , to borrow one . 
So they dug and dug like everything ; and it got awful dark , and the rain started , and the wind swished and swushed along , and the lightning come brisker and brisker , and the thunder boomed ; but them people never took no notice of it , they was so full of this business ; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd , and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave , and the next second the dark wiped it all out , and you could n't see nothing at all . 
At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid , and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was , to scrouge in and get a sight , you never see ; and in the dark , that way , it was awful . 
Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so , and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world , he was so excited and panting . 
All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare , and somebody sings out : `` By the living jingo , here 's the bag of gold on his breast ! ''
