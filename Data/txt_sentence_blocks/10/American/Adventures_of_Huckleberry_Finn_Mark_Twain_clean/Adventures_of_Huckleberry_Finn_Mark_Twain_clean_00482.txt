So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much . 
When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : `` Why , HUCK ! 
En good LAN ' ! 
ain ' dat Misto Tom ? '' 
I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it . 
I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : `` Why , de gracious sakes ! 
do he know you genlmen ? '' 
We could see pretty well now . 
Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : `` Does WHO know us ? '' 
`` Why , dis-yer runaway nigger . ''
