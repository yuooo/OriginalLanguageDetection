As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows -- there war n't none on the side . 
They held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , `` Why , HE ai n't a Shepherdson -- no , there ai n't any Shepherdson about him . '' 
Then the old man said he hoped I would n't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it -- it was only to make sure . 
So he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right . 
He told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : `` Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and do n't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? '' 
`` True for you , Rachel -- I forgot . '' 
So the old lady says : `` Betsy '' -LRB- this was a nigger woman -RRB- , `` you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him -- oh , here he is himself . 
Buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry . '' 
Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me . 
He had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed .
