`` I hai n't been nowheres , '' I says , `` only just hunting for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid . '' 
`` Why , where ever did you go ? '' 
he says . 
`` Your aunt 's been mighty uneasy . '' 
`` She need n't , '' I says , `` because we was all right . 
We followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but could n't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along up - shore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and Sid 's at the post-office to see what he can hear , and I 'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us , and then we 're going home . '' 
So then we went to the post-office to get `` Sid '' ; but just as I suspicioned , he war n't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but Sid did n't come ; so the old man said , come along , let Sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling around -- but we would ride . 
I could n't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid ; and he said there war n't no use in it , and I must come along , and let Aunt Sally see we was all right . 
When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that do n't amount to shucks , and said she 'd serve Sid the same when he come . 
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers ' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard .
