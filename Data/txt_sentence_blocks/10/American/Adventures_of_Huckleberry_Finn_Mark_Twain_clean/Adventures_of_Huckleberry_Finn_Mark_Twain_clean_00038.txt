Sometimes he spec he 'll go ` way , en den agin he spec he 'll stay . 
De bes ' way is to res ' easy en let de ole man take his own way . 
Dey 's two angels hoverin ' roun ' ` bout him . 
One uv 'em is white en shiny , en t ` other one is black . 
De white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up . 
A body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' . 
But you is all right . 
You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo ' life , en considable joy . 
Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you 's gwyne to git well agin . 
Dey 's two gals flyin ' ` bout you in yo ' life .
