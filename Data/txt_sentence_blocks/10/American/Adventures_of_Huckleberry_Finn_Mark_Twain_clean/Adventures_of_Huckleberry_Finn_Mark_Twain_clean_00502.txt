Yes , I reckon that 'll be the best way . '' 
`` Now , there 's SENSE in that , '' I says . 
`` Letting on do n't cost nothing ; letting on ai n't no trouble ; and if it 's any object , I do n't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year . 
It would n't strain me none , after I got my hand in . 
So I 'll mosey along now , and smouch a couple of case-knives . '' 
`` Smouch three , '' he says ; `` we want one to make a saw out of . '' 
`` Tom , if it ai n't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , '' I says , `` there 's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather - boarding behind the smoke-house . '' 
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : `` It ai n't no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck . 
Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them . '' 
So I done it .
