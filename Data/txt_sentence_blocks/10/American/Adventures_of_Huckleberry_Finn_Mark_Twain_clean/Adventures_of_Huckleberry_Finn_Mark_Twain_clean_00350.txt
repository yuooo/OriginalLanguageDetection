`` I thought he lived in London ? '' 
`` Well , he does . 
Where WOULD he live ? '' 
`` But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield ? '' 
I see I was up a stump . 
I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again . 
Then I says : `` I mean he goes to our church regular when he 's in Sheffield . 
That 's only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths . '' 
`` Why , how you talk -- Sheffield ai n't on the sea . '' 
`` Well , who said it was ? ''
