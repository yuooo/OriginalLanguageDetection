And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes , and most shook the hands off of them frauds , saying all the time : `` You DEAR good souls ! 
-- how LOVELY ! 
-- how COULD you ! '' 
Well , then , pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again , and how good he was , and what a loss he was , and all that ; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside , and stood a-listening and looking , and not saying anything ; and nobody saying anything to him either , because the king was talking and they was all busy listening . 
The king was saying -- in the middle of something he 'd started in on -- '' -- they bein ' partickler friends o ' the diseased . 
That 's why they 're invited here this evenin ' ; but tomorrow we want ALL to come -- everybody ; for he respected everybody , he liked everybody , and so it 's fitten that his funeral orgies sh 'd be public . '' 
And so he went a-mooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he could n't stand it no more ; so he writes on a little scrap of paper , `` OBSEQUIES , you old fool , '' and folds it up , and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people 's heads to him . 
The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : `` Poor William , afflicted as he is , his HEART 'S aluz right . 
Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome . 
But he need n't a worried -- it was jest what I was at . ''
