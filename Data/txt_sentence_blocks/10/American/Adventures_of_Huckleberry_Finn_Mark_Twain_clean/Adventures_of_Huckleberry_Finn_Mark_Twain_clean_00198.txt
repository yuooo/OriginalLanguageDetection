My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last I says to it , `` Let up on me -- it ai n't too late yet -- I 'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell . '' 
I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off . 
All my troubles was gone . 
I went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself . 
By and by one showed . 
Jim sings out : `` We 's safe , Huck , we 's safe ! 
Jump up and crack yo ' heels ! 
Dat 's de good ole Cairo at las ' , I jis knows it ! '' 
I says : `` I 'll take the canoe and go and see , Jim . 
It might n't be , you know . ''
