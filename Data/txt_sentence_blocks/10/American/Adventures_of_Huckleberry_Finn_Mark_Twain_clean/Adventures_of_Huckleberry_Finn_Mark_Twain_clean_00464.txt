I 'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance . '' 
`` But we wo n't LET you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it . 
Come right in . '' 
`` Oh , DO , '' says Aunt Sally ; `` it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world . 
You must stay . 
It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk . 
And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us . 
Come right in and make yourself at home . '' 
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow . 
Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : `` You owdacious puppy !
