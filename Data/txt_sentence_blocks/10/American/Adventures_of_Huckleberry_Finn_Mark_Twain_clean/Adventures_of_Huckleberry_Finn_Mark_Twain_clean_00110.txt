We paddled out and got aboard -- clumb in at an upstairs window . 
But it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight . 
The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island . 
Then we looked in at the window . 
We could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall . 
There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man . 
So Jim says : `` Hello , you ! '' 
But it did n't budge . 
So I hollered again , and then Jim says : `` De man ai n't asleep -- he 's dead . 
You hold still -- I 'll go en see . ''
