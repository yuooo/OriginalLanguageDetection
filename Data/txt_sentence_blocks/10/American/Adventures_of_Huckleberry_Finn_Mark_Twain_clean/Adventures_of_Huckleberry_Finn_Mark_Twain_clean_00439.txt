When I got there and see it was gone , I says to myself , ` They 've got into trouble and had to leave ; and they 've took my nigger , which is the only nigger I 've got in the world , and now I 'm in a strange country , and ai n't got no property no more , nor nothing , and no way to make my living ; ' so I set down and cried . 
I slept in the woods all night . 
But what DID become of the raft , then ? 
-- and Jim -- poor Jim ! '' 
`` Blamed if I know -- that is , what 's become of the raft . 
That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he 'd spent for whisky ; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , ` That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river . ' '' 
`` I would n't shake my NIGGER , would I ? 
-- the only nigger I had in the world , and the only property . '' 
`` We never thought of that . 
Fact is , I reckon we 'd come to consider him OUR nigger ; yes , we did consider him so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough for him .
