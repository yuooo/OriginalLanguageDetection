I paddled over to the Illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it . 
I crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody . 
We got home all safe . 
AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but Jim did n't want to . 
He said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha ` nt us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go a-ha ` nting around than one that was planted and comfortable . 
That sounded pretty reasonable , so I did n't say no more ; but I could n't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for . 
We rummaged the clothes we 'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat . 
Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they 'd a knowed the money was there they would n't a left it . 
I said I reckoned they killed him , too ; but Jim did n't want to talk about that . 
I says : `` Now you think it 's bad luck ; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ?
