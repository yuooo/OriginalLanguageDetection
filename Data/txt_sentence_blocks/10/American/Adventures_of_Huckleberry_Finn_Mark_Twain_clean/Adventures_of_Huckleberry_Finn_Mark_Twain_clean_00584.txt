And then Tom he talked along and talked along , and says , le 's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit , and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns , over in the Territory , for a couple of weeks or two ; and I says , all right , that suits me , but I ai n't got no money for to buy the outfit , and I reckon I could n't get none from home , because it 's likely pap 's been back before now , and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up . 
`` No , he hai n't , '' Tom says ; `` it 's all there yet -- six thousand dollars and more ; and your pap hai n't ever been back since . 
Had n't when I come away , anyhow . '' 
Jim says , kind of solemn : `` He ai n't a-comin ' back no mo ' , Huck . '' 
I says : `` Why , Jim ? '' 
`` Nemmine why , Huck -- but he ai n't comin ' back no mo. '' But I kept at him ; so at last he says : `` Doan ' you ` member de house dat was float 'n down de river , en dey wuz a man in dah , kivered up , en I went in en unkivered him and didn ' let you come in ? 
Well , den , you kin git yo ' money when you wants it , kase dat wuz him . '' 
Tom 's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ai n't nothing more to write about , and I am rotten glad of it , because if I 'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I would n't a tackled it , and ai n't a-going to no more . 
But I Information about Project Gutenberg 185 reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest , because Aunt Sally she 's going to adopt me and sivilize me , and I ca n't stand it . 
I been there before .
