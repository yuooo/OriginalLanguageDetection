I doan ' mine one er two kings , but dat 's enough . 
Dis one 's powerful drunk , en de duke ain ' much better . '' 
I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he 'd forgot it . 
IT was after sun-up now , but we went right on and did n't tie up . 
The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ; but after they 'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal . 
After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches , and let his legs dangle in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart . 
When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together . 
The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; `` only , '' he says , `` you must n't bellow out ROMEO ! 
that way , like a bull -- you must say it soft and sick and languishy , so -- R-o-o-meo ! 
that is the idea ; for Juliet 's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she does n't bray like a jackass . ''
