But I war n't comfortable long , because I happened to think of something . 
I knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face . 
So I knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes . 
So I was uncomfortable again . 
I judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though I wished he would n't . 
We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned . 
All the boys did . 
We had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended . 
We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them . 
Tom Sawyer called the hogs `` ingots , '' and he called the turnips and stuff `` julery , '' and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
