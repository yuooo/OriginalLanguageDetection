When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow , though I was most winded , but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot . 
Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as I could go . 
I landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern . 
There Jim laid , sound asleep on the ground . 
I roused him out and says : `` Git up and hump yourself , Jim ! 
There ai n't a minute to lose . 
They 're after us ! '' 
Jim never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared . 
By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid . 
We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and did n't show a candle outside after that .
