She says : `` HERE is my answer . '' 
She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king 's hands , and says , `` Take this six thousand dollars , and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to , and do n't give us no receipt for it . '' 
Then she put her arm around the king on one side , and Susan and the hare - lip done the same on the other . 
Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm , whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud . 
The doctor says : `` All right ; I wash MY hands of the matter . 
But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you 're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day . '' 
And away he went . 
`` All right , doctor , '' says the king , kinder mocking him ; `` we 'll try and get 'em to send for you ; '' which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit . 
WELL , when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for Uncle William , and she 'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it . 
The king said the cubby would do for his valley -- meaning me .
