THINK of it , s ` I ? 
I lay it never sawed ITSELF off , s ` I -- somebody SAWED it , s ` I ; that 's my opinion , take it or leave it , it may n't be no ` count , s ` I , but sich as ' t is , it 's my opinion , s ` I , 'n' if any body k 'n start a better one , s ` I , let him DO it , s ` I , that 's all . 
I says to Sister Dunlap , s ` I -- '' `` Why , dog my cats , they must a ben a house-full o ' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work , Sister Phelps . 
Look at that shirt -- every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ 'n done with blood ! 
Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along , all the time , amost . 
Why , I 'd give two dollars to have it read to me ; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it , I ` low I 'd take 'n' lash 'm t 'll -- '' `` People to HELP him , Brother Marples ! 
Well , I reckon you 'd THINK so if you 'd a been in this house for a while back . 
Why , they 've stole everything they could lay their hands on -- and we a-watching all the time , mind you . 
They stole that shirt right off o ' the line ! 
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of , ther ' ai n't no telling how many times they DID N'T steal that ; and flour , and candles , and candlesticks , and spoons , and the old warming-pan , and most a thousand things that I disremember now , and my new calico dress ; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day AND night , as I was a-telling you , and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ; and here at the last minute , lo and behold you , they slides right in under our noses and fools us , and not only fools US but the Injun Territory robbers too , and actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe and sound , and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time !
