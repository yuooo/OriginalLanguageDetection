But it war n't . 
It was Jack-o ' - lanterns , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before . 
Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom . 
Well , I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish , too , to hear him , because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most free -- and who was to blame for it ? 
Why , ME . 
I could n't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way . 
It got to troubling me so I could n't rest ; I could n't stay still in one place . 
It had n't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that I was doing . 
But now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more . 
I tried to make out to myself that I war n't to blame , because I did n't run Jim off from his rightful owner ; but it war n't no use , conscience up and says , every time , `` But you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody . ''
