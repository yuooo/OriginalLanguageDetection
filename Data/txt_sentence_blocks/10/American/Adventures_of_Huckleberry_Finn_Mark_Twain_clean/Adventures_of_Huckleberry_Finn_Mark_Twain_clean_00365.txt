`` We sha 'n' t rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money . 
The people that BUYS the property is the suff ` rers ; because as soon 's it 's found out ` at we did n't own it -- which wo n't be long after we 've slid -- the sale wo n't be valid , and it 'll all go back to the estate . 
These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin , and that 's enough for THEM ; they 're young and spry , and k 'n easy earn a livin ' . 
THEY ai n't a-goin to suffer . 
Why , jest think -- there 's thous 'n' s and thous 'n' s that ai n't nigh so well off . 
Bless you , THEY ai n't got noth 'n' to complain of . '' 
Well , the king he talked him blind ; so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them .

What do we k ` yer for HIM ? 
Hai n't we got all the fools in town on our side ?
