When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over . 
I says to myself , shall I go to that doctor , private , and blow on these frauds ? 
No -- that wo n't do . 
He might tell who told him ; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me . 
Shall I go , private , and tell Mary Jane ? 
No -- I das n't do it . 
Her face would give them a hint , sure ; they 've got the money , and they 'd slide right out and get away with it . 
If she was to fetch in help I 'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with , I judge . 
No ; there ai n't no good way but one . 
I got to steal that money , somehow ; and I got to steal it some way that they wo n't suspicion that I done it .
