But they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her . 
So she run on : `` Lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away -- or did you get your breakfast on the boat ? '' 
I said I had got it on the boat . 
So then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after . 
When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : `` Now I can have a GOOD look at you ; and , laws-a-me , I 've been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it 's come at last ! 
We been expecting you a couple of days and more . 
What kep ' you ? 
-- boat get aground ? ''
