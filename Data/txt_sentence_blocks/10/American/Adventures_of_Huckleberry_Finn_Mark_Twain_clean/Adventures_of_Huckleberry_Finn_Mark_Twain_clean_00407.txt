`` Where is it , then ? '' 
`` Well , when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o ' the straw tick o ' my bed , not wishin ' to bank it for the few days we 'd be here , and considerin ' the bed a safe place , we not bein ' used to niggers , and suppos 'n' 'em honest , like servants in England . 
The niggers stole it the very next mornin ' after I had went down stairs ; and when I sold 'em I had n't missed the money yit , so they got clean away with it . 
My servant here k 'n tell you ` bout it , gentlemen . '' 
The doctor and several said `` Shucks ! '' 
and I see nobody did n't altogether believe him . 
One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it . 
I said no , but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away , and I never thought nothing , only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them . 
That was all they asked me . 
Then the doctor whirls on me and says : `` Are YOU English , too ? ''
