The island was three mile long . 
I judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up . 
But they did n't yet a while . 
They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went . 
I crossed over to that side and watched them . 
When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town . 
I knowed I was all right now . 
Nobody else would come a-hunting after me . 
I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods . 
I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain could n't get at them .
