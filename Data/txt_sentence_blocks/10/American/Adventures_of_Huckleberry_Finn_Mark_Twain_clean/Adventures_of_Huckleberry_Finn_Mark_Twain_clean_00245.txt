Said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but das n't answer , because he did n't want nobody to pick HIM up and take him into slavery again . 
Says he : `` I got hurt a little , en could n't swim fas ' , so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las ' ; when you landed I reck ` ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan ' ` dout havin ' to shout at you , but when I see dat house I begin to go slow . 
I ` uz off too fur to hearwhat dey say to you -- I wuz ` fraid o ' de dogs ; but when it ` uz all quiet agin I knowed you 's in de house , so I struck out for de woods to wait for day . 
Early in de mawnin ' some er de niggers come along , gwyne to de fields , en dey tuk me en showed me dis place , whah de dogs ca n't track me on accounts o ' de water , en dey brings me truck to eat every night , en tells me how you 's a-gitt 'n along . '' 
`` Why did n't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner , Jim ? '' 
`` Well , ` twar n't no use to ` sturb you , Huck , tell we could do sumfn -- but we 's all right now . 
I ben a-buyin ' pots en pans en vittles , as I got a chanst , en a-patchin ' up de raf ' nights when -- '' `` WHAT raft , Jim ? '' 
`` Our ole raf ' . '' 
`` You mean to say our old raft war n't smashed all to flinders ? '' 
`` No , she war n't .
