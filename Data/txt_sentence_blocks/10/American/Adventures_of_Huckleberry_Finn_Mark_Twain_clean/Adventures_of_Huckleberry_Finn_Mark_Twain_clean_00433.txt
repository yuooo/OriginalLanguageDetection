That 's just the way : a person does a low-down thing , and then he do n't want to take no consequences of it . 
Thinks as long as he can hide , it ai n't no disgrace . 
That was my fix exactly . 
The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me , and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling . 
And at last , when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven , whilst I was stealing a poor old woman 's nigger that had n't ever done me no harm , and now was showing me there 's One that 's always on the lookout , and ai n't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further , I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared . 
Well , I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked , and so I war n't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , `` There was the Sunday-school , you could a gone to it ; and if you 'd a done it they 'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I 'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire . '' 
It made me shiver . 
And I about made up my mind to pray , and see if I could n't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better . 
So I kneeled down . 
But the words would n't come .
