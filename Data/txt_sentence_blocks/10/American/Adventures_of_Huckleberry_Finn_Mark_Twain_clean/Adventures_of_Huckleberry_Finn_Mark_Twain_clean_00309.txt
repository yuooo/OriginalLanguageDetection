And they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep . 
So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads could n't come up to Shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedy -- and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned . 
He said he could size their style . 
So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village . 
The bills said : AT THE COURT HOUSE ! 
FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY ! 
The World-Renowned Tragedians DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER ! 
AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER ! 
Of the London and Continental Theatres , In their Thrilling Tragedy of THE KING 'S CAMELEOPARD , OR THE ROYAL NONESUCH ! ! ! 
Admission 50 cents .
