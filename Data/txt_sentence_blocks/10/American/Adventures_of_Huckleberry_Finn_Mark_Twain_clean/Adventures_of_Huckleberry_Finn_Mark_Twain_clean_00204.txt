`` Poor devil , there 's something in that . 
We are right down sorry for you , but we -- well , hang it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see . 
Look here , I 'll tell you what to do . 
Do n't you try to land by yourself , or you 'll smash everything to pieces . 
You float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river . 
It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever . 
Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter . 
Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy . 
It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard . 
Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he 's in pretty hard luck .
