And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody . 
Then somebody sings out , `` Take up a collection for him , take up a collection ! '' 
Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , `` Let HIM pass the hat around ! '' 
Then everybody said it , the preacher too . 
So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times -- and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates . 
When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents . 
And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods . 
The king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he 'd ever put in in the missionarying line . 
He said it war n't no use talking , heathens do n't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with . 
The duke was thinking HE 'D been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he did n't think so so much .
