`` Maybe he wo n't . 
But we got to have it anyway . 
Come along . '' 
So they got out and went in . 
The door slammed to because it was on the careened side ; and in a half second I was in the boat , and Jim come tumbling after me . 
I out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went ! 
We did n't touch an oar , and we did n't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe . 
We went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the paddle-box , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it . 
When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was . 
Then Jim manned the oars , and we took out after our raft .
