Well , after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco . 
I went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there . 
I killed him , and curled him up on the foot of Jim 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when Jim found him there . 
Well , by night I forgot all about the snake , and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him . 
He jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring . 
I laid him out in a second with a stick , and Jim grabbed pap 's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down . 
He was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel . 
That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it . 
Jim told me to chop off the snake 's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it . 
I done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him .
