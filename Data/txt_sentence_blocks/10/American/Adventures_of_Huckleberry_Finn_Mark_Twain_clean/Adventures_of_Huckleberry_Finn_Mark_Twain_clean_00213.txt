We could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close . 
She aimed right for us . 
Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he 's mighty smart . 
Well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be sheering off a bit . 
She was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us . 
There was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steam -- and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft . 
I dived -- and I aimed to find the bottom , too , for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me , and I wanted it to have plenty of room . 
I could always stay under water a minute ; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half . 
Then I bounced for the top in a hurry , for I was nearly busting . 
I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit .
