Then pretty soon he says : `` Come to think , the logs ai n't a-going to do ; they do n't have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock . 
We 'll fetch a rock . '' 
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he would n't ever get out . 
But Tom said he would let me help him do it . 
Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens . 
It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and did n't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we did n't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so Tom says : `` I know how to fix it . 
We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions , and we can kill two birds with that same rock . 
There 's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill , and we 'll smouch it , and carve the things on it , and file out the pens and the saw on it , too . '' 
It war n't no slouch of an idea ; and it war n't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ; but we allowed we 'd tackle it . 
It war n't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill , leaving Jim at work .
