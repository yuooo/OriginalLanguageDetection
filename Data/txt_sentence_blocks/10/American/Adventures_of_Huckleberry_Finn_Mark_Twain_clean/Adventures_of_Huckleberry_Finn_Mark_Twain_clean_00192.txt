He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he could n't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away . 
But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : `` What do dey stan ' for ? 
I ` se gwyne to tell you . 
When I got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin ' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz mos ' broke bekase you wuz los ' , en I didn ' k ` yer no ' mo ' what become er me en de raf ' . 
En when I wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en soun ' , de tears come , en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo ' foot , I 's so thankful . 
En all you wuz thinkin ' ` bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie . 
Dat truck dah is TRASH ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren 's en makes 'em ashamed . '' 
Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that . 
But that was enough . 
It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back .
