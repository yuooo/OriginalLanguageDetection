When the court wants to find out something about these two , let them send up to Bricksville and say they 've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch , and ask for some witnesses -- why , you 'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink , Miss Mary . 
And they 'll come a-biling , too . '' 
I judged we had got everything fixed about right now . 
So I says : `` Just let the auction go right along , and do n't worry . 
Nobody do n't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice , and they ai n't going out of this till they get that money ; and the way we 've fixed it the sale ai n't going to count , and they ai n't going to get no money . 
It 's just like the way it was with the niggers -- it war n't no sale , and the niggers will be back before long . 
Why , they ca n't collect the money for the NIGGERS yet -- they 're in the worst kind of a fix , Miss Mary . '' 
`` Well , '' she says , `` I 'll run down to breakfast now , and then I 'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop 's . '' '' 
` Deed , THAT ai n't the ticket , Miss Mary Jane , '' I says , `` by no manner of means ; go BEFORE breakfast . '' 
`` Why ? ''
