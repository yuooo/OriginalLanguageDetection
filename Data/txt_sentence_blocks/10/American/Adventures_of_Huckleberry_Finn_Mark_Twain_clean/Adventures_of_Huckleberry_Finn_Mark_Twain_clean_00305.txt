Now LEAVE -- and take your half-a-man with you '' -- tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this . 
The crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them , looking tolerable cheap . 
I could a stayed if I wanted to , but I did n't want to . 
I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent . 
I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money , but I reckoned I better save it , because there ai n't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way . 
You ca n't be too careful . 
I ai n't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in WASTING it on them . 
It was a real bully circus . 
It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them -- and every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds . 
It was a powerful fine sight ; I never see anything so lovely .
