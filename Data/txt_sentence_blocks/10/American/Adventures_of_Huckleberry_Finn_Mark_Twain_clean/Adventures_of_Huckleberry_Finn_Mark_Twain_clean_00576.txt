And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things , and nonnamous letters from the robbers , and get up and down the lightning-rod , and dig the hole into the cabin , and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie , and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket -- '' `` Mercy sakes ! '' '' 
-- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on , for company for Jim ; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business , because the men come before we was out of the cabin , and we had to rush , and they heard us and let drive at us , and I got my share , and we dodged out of the path and let them go by , and when the dogs come they war n't interested in us , but went for the most noise , and we got our canoe , and made for the raft , and was all safe , and Jim was a free man , and we done it all by ourselves , and WAS N'T it bully , Aunty ! '' 
`` Well , I never heard the likes of it in all my born days ! 
So it was YOU , you little rapscallions , that 's been making all this trouble , and turned everybody 's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death . 
I 've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o ' you this very minute . 
To think , here I 've been , night after night , a -- YOU just get well once , you young scamp , and I lay I 'll tan the Old Harry out o ' both o ' ye ! '' 
But Tom , he WAS so proud and joyful , he just COULD N'T hold in , and his tongue just WENT it -- she a-chipping in , and spitting fire all along , and both of them going it at once , like a cat convention ; and she says : `` WELL , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW , for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again -- '' `` Meddling with WHO ? '' 
Tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised . 
`` With WHO ? 
Why , the runaway nigger , of course .
