I laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it . 
The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; I never knowed it before . 
And how far a body can hear on the water such nights ! 
I heard people talking at the ferry landing . 
I heard what they said , too -- every word of it . 
One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now . 
T'other one said THIS war n't one of the short ones , he reckoned -- and then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he did n't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone . 
The first fellow said he ` lowed to tell it to his old woman -- she would think it was pretty good ; but he said that war n't nothing to some things he had said in his time . 
I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight would n't wait more than about a week longer . 
After that the talk got further and further away , and I could n't make out the words any more ; but I could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off .
