`` That 's more LIKE , '' he says . 
`` It 's real mysterious , and troublesome , and good , '' he says ; `` but I bet we can find a way that 's twice as long . 
There ai n't no hurry ; le 's keep on looking around . '' 
Betwixt the hut and the fence , on the back side , was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves , and was made out of plank . 
It was as long as the hut , but narrow -- only about six foot wide . 
The door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked . 
Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples . 
The chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and had n't no connection with it ; and there war n't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow . 
The match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever . 
Tom was joyful .
