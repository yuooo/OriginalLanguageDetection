So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for I found his tracks in the snow . 
What I wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ? 
Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor . 
It fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch . 
Jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same . 
Jim got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened . 
But it war n't no use ; he said it would n't talk . 
He said sometimes it would n't talk without money . 
I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that war n't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it would n't pass nohow , even if the brass did n't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time . 
-LRB- I reckoned I would n't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge . -RRB-
