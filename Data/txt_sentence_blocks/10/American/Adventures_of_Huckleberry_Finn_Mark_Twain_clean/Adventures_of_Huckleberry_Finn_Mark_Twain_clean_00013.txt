We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old tanyard . 
So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore . 
We went to a clump of bushes , and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes . 
Then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees . 
We went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up . 
Tom poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you would n't a noticed that there was a hole . 
We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and sweaty and cold , and there we stopped . 
Tom says : `` Now , we 'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer 's Gang . 
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood . '' 
Everybody was willing .
