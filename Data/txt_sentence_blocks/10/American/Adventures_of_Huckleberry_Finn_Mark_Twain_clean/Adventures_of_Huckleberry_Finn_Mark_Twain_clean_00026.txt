But I could n't see no profit in it . 
One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan -LRB- which was the sign for the Gang to get together -RRB- , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand `` sumter '' mules , all loaded down with di ` monds , and they did n't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things . 
He said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready . 
He never could go after even a turnip - cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they war n't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before . 
I did n't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I was on hand next day , Saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill . 
But there war n't no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants . 
It war n't anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that . 
We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut . 
I did n't see no di ` monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so . 
He said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things .
