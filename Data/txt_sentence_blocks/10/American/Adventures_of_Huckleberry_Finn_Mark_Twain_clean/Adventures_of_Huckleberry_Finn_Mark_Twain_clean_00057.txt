Lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what I said . 
Says I , for two cents I 'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin . 
Them 's the very words . 
I says look at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it 's below my chin , and then it ai n't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o ' stove-pipe . 
Look at it , says I -- such a hat for me to wear -- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights . 
`` Oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful . 
Why , looky here . 
There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter , most as white as a white man . 
He had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silver - headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State . 
And what do you think ?
