We war n't looking for YOU at all , but only Tom . 
Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him . '' 
`` It 's because it war n't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom , '' he says ; `` but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger . 
But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally . 
This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come . '' 
`` No -- not impudent whelps , Sid . 
You ought to had your jaws boxed ; I hai n't been so put out since I do n't know when . 
But I do n't care , I do n't mind the terms -- I 'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here . 
Well , to think of that performance ! 
I do n't deny it , I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack . ''
