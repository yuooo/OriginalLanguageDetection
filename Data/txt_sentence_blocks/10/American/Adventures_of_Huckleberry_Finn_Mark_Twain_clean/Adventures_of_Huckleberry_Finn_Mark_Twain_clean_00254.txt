Jim war n't on his island , so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country . 
The raft was gone ! 
My souls , but I was scared ! 
I could n't get my breath for most a minute . 
Then I raised a yell . 
A voice not twenty-five foot from me says : `` Good lan ' ! 
is dat you , honey ? 
Doan ' make no noise . '' 
It was Jim 's voice -- nothing ever sounded so good before . 
I run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me .
