He went , and bent down and looked , and says : `` It 's a dead man . 
Yes , indeedy ; naked , too . 
He 's ben shot in de back . 
I reck 'n he 's ben dead two er three days . 
Come in , Huck , but doan ' look at his face -- it 's too gashly . '' 
I did n't look at him at all . 
Jim throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; I did n't want to see him . 
There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal . 
There was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sun-bonnet , and some women 's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too . 
We put the lot into the canoe -- it might come good .
