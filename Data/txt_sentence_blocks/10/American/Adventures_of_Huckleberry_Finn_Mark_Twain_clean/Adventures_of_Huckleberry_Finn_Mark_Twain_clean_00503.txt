AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod , and shut ourselves up in the lean-to , and got out our pile of fox-fire , and went to work . 
We cleared everything out of the way , about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log . 
Tom said we was right behind Jim 's bed now , and we 'd dig in under it , and when we got through there could n't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there , because Jim 's counter-pin hung down most to the ground , and you 'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole . 
So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight ; and then we was dog-tired , and our hands was blistered , and yet you could n't see we 'd done anything hardly . 
At last I says : `` This ai n't no thirty-seven year job ; this is a thirty-eight year job , Tom Sawyer . '' 
He never said nothing . 
But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking . 
Then he says : `` It ai n't no use , Huck , it ai n't a-going to work . 
If we was prisoners it would , because then we 'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we would n't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands would n't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done . 
But WE ca n't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ai n't got no time to spare .
