He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides . 
So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it . 
I need n't tell what it was here , because I knowed it would n't stay the way , it was . 
I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance . 
And that is what he done . 
Well , one thing was dead sure , and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest , and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery . 
That was the thing that was too many for me . 
Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leather-headed ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody . 
I COULD N'T understand it no way at all .
