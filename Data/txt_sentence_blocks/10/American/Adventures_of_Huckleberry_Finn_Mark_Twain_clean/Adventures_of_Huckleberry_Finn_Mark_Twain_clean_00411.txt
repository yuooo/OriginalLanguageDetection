That muleheaded old fool would n't give in THEN ! 
Indeed he would n't . 
Said it war n't no fair test . 
Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world , and had n't tried to write -- HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper . 
And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in , and says : `` I 've thought of something . 
Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying ? '' 
`` Yes , '' says somebody , `` me and Ab Turner done it . 
We 're both here . '' 
Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : `` Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast ? '' 
Blamed if the king did n't have to brace up mighty quick , or he 'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man ?
