I heard Buck 's gun go off at my ear , and Harney 's hat tumbled off from his head . 
He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid . 
But we did n't wait . 
We started through the woods on a run . 
The woods war n't thick , so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat , I reckon , but I could n't see . 
We never stopped running till we got home . 
The old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute -- 't was pleasure , mainly , I judged -- then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : `` I do n't like that shooting from behind a bush . 
Why did n't you step into the road , my boy ? '' 
`` The Shepherdsons do n't , father . 
They always take advantage . ''
