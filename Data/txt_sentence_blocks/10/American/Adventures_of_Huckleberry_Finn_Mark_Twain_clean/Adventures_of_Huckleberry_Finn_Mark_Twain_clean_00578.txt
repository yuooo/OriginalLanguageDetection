Turn him loose ! 
he ai n't no slave ; he 's as free as any cretur that walks this earth ! '' 
`` What DOES the child mean ? '' 
`` I mean every word I SAY , Aunt Sally , and if somebody do n't go , I 'LL go . 
I 've knowed him all his life , and so has Tom , there . 
Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and SAID so ; and she set him free in her will . '' 
`` Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for , seeing he was already free ? '' 
`` Well , that IS a question , I must say ; and just like women ! 
Why , I wanted the ADVENTURE of it ; and I 'd a waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive , AUNT POLLY ! '' 
If she war n't standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , I wish I may never !
