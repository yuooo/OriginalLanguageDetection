Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch . 
By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk . 
He says : `` Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . '' 
`` Tools ? '' 
I says . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Tools for what ? '' 
`` Why , to dig with . 
We ai n't a-going to GNAW him out , are we ? '' 
`` Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ? ''
