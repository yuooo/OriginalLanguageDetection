By and by Jim says : `` But looky here , Huck , who wuz it dat ` uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you ? '' 
Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart . 
He said Tom Sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what I had . 
Then I says : `` How do you come to be here , Jim , and how 'd you get here ? '' 
He looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute . 
Then he says : `` Maybe I better not tell . '' 
`` Why , Jim ? '' 
`` Well , dey 's reasons . 
But you wouldn ' tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck ? '' 
`` Blamed if I would , Jim . ''
