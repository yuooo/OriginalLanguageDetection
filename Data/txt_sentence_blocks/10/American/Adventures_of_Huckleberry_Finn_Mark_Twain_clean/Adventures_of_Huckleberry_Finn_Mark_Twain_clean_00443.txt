So pretty soon he says : `` The man that bought him is named Abram Foster -- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile back here in the country , on the road to Lafayette . '' 
`` All right , '' I says , `` I can walk it in three days . 
And I 'll start this very afternoon . '' 
`` No you wont , you 'll start NOW ; and do n't you lose any time about it , neither , nor do any gabbling by the way . 
Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along , and then you wo n't get into trouble with US , d'ye hear ? '' 
That was the order I wanted , and that was the one I played for . 
I wanted to be left free to work my plans . 
`` So clear out , '' he says ; `` and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to . 
Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your nigger -- some idiots do n't require documents -- leastways I 've heard there 's such down South here . 
And when you tell him the handbill and the reward 's bogus , maybe he 'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out .
