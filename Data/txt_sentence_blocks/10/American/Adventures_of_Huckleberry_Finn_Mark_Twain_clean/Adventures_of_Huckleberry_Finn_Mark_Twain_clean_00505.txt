It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick , WITHOUT any letting on , because you do n't know no better ; but it would n't for me , because I do know better . 
Gim me a case-knife . '' 
He had his own by him , but I handed him mine . 
He flung it down , and says : `` Gim me a CASE-KNIFE . '' 
I did n't know just what to do -- but then I thought . 
I scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word . 
He was always just that particular . 
Full of principle . 
So then I got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly . 
We stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it .
