I rouses up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon I hears it again . 
I hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up -- about abreast the ferry . 
And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down . 
I knowed what was the matter now . 
`` Boom ! '' 
I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat 's side . 
You see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top . 
I was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke . 
So I set there and watched the cannon - smoke and listened to the boom . 
The river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat .
