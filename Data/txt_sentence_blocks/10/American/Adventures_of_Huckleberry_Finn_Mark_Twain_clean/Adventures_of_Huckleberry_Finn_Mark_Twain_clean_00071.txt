Now I thought of something else . 
So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house . 
I took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking . 
Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too , you might say , in the season . 
There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , I do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river . 
The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake . 
I dropped pap 's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident . 
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it would n't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again . 
It was about dark now ; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise . 
I made fast to a willow ; then I took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
