I am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design . 
They will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger 's cabin to get him . 
I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger ; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure . 
Do n't do anything but just the way I am telling you ; if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo . 
I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing . 
UNKNOWN FRIEND . 
WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they did n't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and would n't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but did n't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cubboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about half - past eleven , and Tom put on Aunt Sally 's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : `` Where 's the butter ? '' 
`` I laid out a hunk of it , '' I says , `` on a piece of a corn-pone . '' 
`` Well , you LEFT it laid out , then -- it ai n't here . '' 
`` We can get along without it , '' I says .
