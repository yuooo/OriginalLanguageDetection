The other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery . 
After breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another . 
`` What got you into trouble ? '' 
says the baldhead to t ` other chap . 
`` Well , I 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth -- and it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with it -- but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off . 
So I told you I was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out WITH you . 
That 's the whole yarn -- what 's yourn ? 
`` Well , I 'd ben a-running ' a little temperance revival thar ` bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for I was makin ' it mighty warm for the rummies , I TELL you , and takin ' as much as five or six dollars a night -- ten cents a head , children and niggers free -- and business a-growin ' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin ' in my time with a private jug on the sly . 
A nigger rousted me out this mornin ' , and told me the people was getherin ' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they 'd be along pretty soon and give me ` bout half an hour 's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they 'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure . 
I did n't wait for no breakfast -- I war n't hungry . ''
