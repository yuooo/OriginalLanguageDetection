So it was all up with Cairo . 
We talked it all over . 
It would n't do to take to the shore ; we could n't take the raft up the stream , of course . 
There war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances . 
So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone ! 
We did n't say a word for a good while . 
There war n't anything to say . 
We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin ; so what was the use to talk about it ? 
It would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still . 
By and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
