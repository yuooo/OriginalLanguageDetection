Well , how they all took on ! 
They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey 's feelings and the poor girl 's feelings , and all that . 
But it war n't no use ; he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and could n't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar . 
The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM . 
He says : `` I was your father 's friend , and I 'm your friend ; and I warn you as a friend , and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble , to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him , the ignorant tramp , with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew , as he calls it . 
He is the thinnest kind of an impostor -- has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres , and you take them for PROOFS , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here , who ought to know better . 
Mary Jane Wilks , you know me for your friend , and for your unselfish friend , too . 
Now listen to me ; turn this pitiful rascal out -- I BEG you to do it . 
Will you ? '' 
Mary Jane straightened herself up , and my , but she was handsome !
