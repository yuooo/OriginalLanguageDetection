Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side . 
That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death . 
Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman -- not the king 's way , though the king 's WAS pretty good for an imitation . 
I ca n't give the old gent 's words , nor I ca n't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : `` This is a surprise to me which I was n't looking for ; and I 'll acknowledge , candid and frank , I ai n't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he 's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake . 
I am Peter Wilks ' brother Harvey , and this is his brother William , which ca n't hear nor speak -- and ca n't even make signs to amount to much , now ' t he 's only got one hand to work them with . 
We are who we say we are ; and in a day or two , when I get the baggage , I can prove it . 
But up till then I wo n't say nothing more , but go to the hotel and wait . '' 
So him and the new dummy started off ; and the king he laughs , and blethers out : `` Broke his arm -- VERY likely , AI N'T it ? 
-- and very convenient , too , for a fraud that 's got to make signs , and ai n't learnt how . 
Lost their baggage !
