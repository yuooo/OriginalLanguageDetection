I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was -- a skiff , away across the water . 
I could n't tell how many was in it . 
It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there war n't but one man in it . 
Think 's I , maybe it 's pap , though I war n't expecting him . 
He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him . 
Well , it WAS pap , sure enough -- and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars . 
I did n't lose no time . 
The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank . 
I made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me . 
I got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float .
