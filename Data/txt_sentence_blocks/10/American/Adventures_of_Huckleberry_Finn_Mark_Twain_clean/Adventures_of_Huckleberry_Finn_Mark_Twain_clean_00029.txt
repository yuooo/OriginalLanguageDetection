And what 's more -- if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp . '' 
`` How you talk , Huck Finn . 
Why , you 'd HAVE to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not . '' 
`` What ! 
and I as high as a tree and as big as a church ? 
All right , then ; I WOULD come ; but I lay I 'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country . '' 
`` Shucks , it ai n't no use to talk to you , Huck Finn . 
You do n't seem to know anything , somehow -- perfect saphead . '' 
I thought all this over for two or three days , and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it . 
I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it war n't no use , none of the genies come .
