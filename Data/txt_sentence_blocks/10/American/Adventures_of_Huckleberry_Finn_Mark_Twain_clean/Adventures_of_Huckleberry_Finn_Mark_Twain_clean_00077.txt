I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side . 
There was a little gray in the sky now ; so I stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast . 
THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock . 
I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied . 
I could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them . 
There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there . 
A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly . 
I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- did n't want to get up and cook breakfast . 
Well , I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of `` boom ! '' 
away up the river .
