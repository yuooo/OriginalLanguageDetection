So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it . 
It swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he must n't eat and he must n't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band . 
And nobody that did n't belong to the band could use that mark , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed . 
And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever . 
Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head . 
He said , some of it , but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books , and every gang that was high-toned had it . 
Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that told the secrets . 
Tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in . 
Then Ben Rogers says : `` Here 's Huck Finn , he hai n't got no family ; what you going to do ` bout him ? '' 
`` Well , hai n't he got a father ? ''
