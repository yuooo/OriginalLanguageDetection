We smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job . 
Sometimes , do what we could , we could n't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time . 
Tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through . 
We got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat . 
We see it war n't no use ; we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and Tom superintended . 
He could out-superintend any boy I ever see . 
He knowed how to do everything . 
Our hole was pretty big , but it war n't big enough to get the grindstone through ; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough . 
Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail , and set Jim to work on them , with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean - to for a hammer , and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him , and then he could go to bed , and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it . 
Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed - leg , and was ready for bed ourselves .
