So Mary Jane took us up , and she showed them their rooms , which was plain but nice . 
She said she 'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey 's way , but he said they war n't . 
The frocks was hung along the wall , and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor . 
There was an old hair trunk in one corner , and a guitar-box in another , and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around , like girls brisken up a room with . 
The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings , and so do n't disturb them . 
The duke 's room was pretty small , but plenty good enough , and so was my cubby . 
That night they had a big supper , and all them men and women was there , and I stood behind the king and the duke 's chairs and waited on them , and the niggers waited on the rest . 
Mary Jane she set at the head of the table , with Susan alongside of her , and said how bad the biscuits was , and how mean the preserves was , and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was -- and all that kind of rot , the way women always do for to force out compliments ; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop , and said so -- said `` How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice ? '' 
and `` Where , for the land 's sake , DID you get these amaz 'n pickles ? '' 
and all that kind of humbug talky-talk , just the way people always does at a supper , you know .
