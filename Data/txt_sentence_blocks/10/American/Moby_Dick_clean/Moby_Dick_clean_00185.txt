She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no Cooke or Vancouver had ever sailed . 
If American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages . 
They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions , your Cookes , Your Krusensterns ; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket , that were as great , and greater , than your Cooke and your Krusenstern . 
For in their succorless empty-handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have willingly dared . 
All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages , those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers . 
Often , adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship 's common log . 
Ah , the world ! 
Oh , the world ! 
Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn , no commerce but colonial , scarcely any intercourse but colonial , was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast . 
It was the whalemen who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru , Chili , and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts .
