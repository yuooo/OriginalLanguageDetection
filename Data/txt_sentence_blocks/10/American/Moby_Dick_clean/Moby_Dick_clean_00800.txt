I would not take it . 
The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine eyeballs ache and ache ; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some stunning ground . 
Oh , oh ! 
Yet blindfold , yet will I talk to thee . 
Light though thou be , thou leapest out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee ! 
The javelins cease ; open eyes ; see , or not ? 
There burn the flames ! 
Oh , thou magnanimous ! 
now do I do glory in my genealogy . 
But thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , I know not .
