We were fain to button up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers . 
But the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes , but dumplings ; good heavens ! 
dumplings for supper ! 
One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner . 
`` My boy , '' said the landlord , `` you 'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty . '' 
`` Landlord , '' I whispered , `` that aint the harpooneer is it ? '' 
`` Oh , no , '' said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , `` the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap . 
He never eats dumplings , he do n't -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes 'em rare . '' 
`` The devil he does , '' says I. `` Where is that harpooneer ? 
Is he here ? ''
