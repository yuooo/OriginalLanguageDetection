This ship and I are two brave fellows ! 
-- Ha , ha ! 
Some one take me up , and launch me , spine-wise , on the sea , -- for by live-oaks ! 
my spine 's a keel . 
Ha , ha ! 
we go the gait that leaves no dust behind ! '' 
`` There she blows -- she blows ! 
-- she blows ! 
-- right ahead ! '' 
was now the mast-head cry .
