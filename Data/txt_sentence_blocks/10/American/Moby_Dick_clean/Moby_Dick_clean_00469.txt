exclaimed Stubb , approvingly , `` coax 'em to it , try that , '' and Fleece continued . 
`` Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow-critters , dat dat woraciousness -- ` top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail ! 
How you tink to hear , ` spose you keep up such a dam slapping and bitin ' dare ? '' 
`` Cook , '' cried Stubb , collaring him , `` I wo n't have that swearing . 
Talk to 'em gentlemanly . '' 
Once more the sermon proceeded . 
`` Your woraciousness , fellow-critters . 
I do n't blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and ca n't be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint . 
You is sharks , sartin ; but if you gobern de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ` ing more dan de shark well goberned . 
Now , look here , bred ` ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale .
