But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight . 
`` Your hat , your hat , sir ! '' 
suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen-mast-head , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them . 
But already the sable wing was before the old man 's eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize . 
An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin 's head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome . 
But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good . 
Ahab 's hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea . 
The Pequod Meets The Delight The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the Delight , was descried . 
As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling-ships , cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats . 
Upon the stranger 's shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale-boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , half-unhinged , and bleaching skeleton of a horse .
