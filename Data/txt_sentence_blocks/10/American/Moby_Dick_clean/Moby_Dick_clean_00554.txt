But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale 's proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you . 
If you attentively regard almost any quadruped 's spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper . 
It is a German conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls . 
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive . 
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso-relieve , the beaked prow of his canoe . 
Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal . 
For I believe that much of a man 's character will be found betokened in his backbone . 
I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are . 
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul .
