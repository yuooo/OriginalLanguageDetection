Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast -- and Loose-Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty . 
In the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance-that happened within the last two years . 
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover , or Sandwich , or some one of the Cinque Ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore . 
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden . 
Holding the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his . 
By some writers this office is called a sinecure . 
But not so . 
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them . 
Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners , bare-footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good 150 pounds from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of Blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale 's head , he says -- `` Hands off ! 
this fish , my masters , is a Fast-Fish .
