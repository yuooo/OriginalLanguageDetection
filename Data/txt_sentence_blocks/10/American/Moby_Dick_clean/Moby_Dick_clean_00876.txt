Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes ! 
But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ? 
I feel deadly faint , bowed , and humped , as though I were Adam , staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise . 
God ! 
God ! 
God ! 
-- crack my heart ! 
-- stave my brain ! 
-- mockery ! 
mockery !
