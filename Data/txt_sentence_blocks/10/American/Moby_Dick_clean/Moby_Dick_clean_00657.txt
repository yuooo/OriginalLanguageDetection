It is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting . 
I hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing . 
Gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen . 
It designates the dark , glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale , and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan . 
Nippers . 
Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale 's vocabulary . 
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so . 
A whaleman 's nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan 's tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe . 
Edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities . 
But to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room , and have a long talk with its inmates .
