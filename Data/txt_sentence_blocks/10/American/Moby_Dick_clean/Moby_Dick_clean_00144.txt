You 'll starve ; you 'll kill yourself , Queequeg . '' 
But not a word did he reply . 
Despairing of him , therefore , I determined to go to bed and to sleep ; and no doubt , before a great while , he would follow me . 
But previous to turning in , I took my heavy bearskin jacket , and threw it over him , as it promised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on . 
For some time , do all I would , I could not get into the faintest doze . 
I had blown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg -- not four feet off -- sitting there in that uneasy position , stark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really wretched . 
Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan ! 
But somehow I dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the bedside , there squatted Queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor . 
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where I lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his Ramadan was over . 
Now , as I before hinted , I have no objection to any person 's religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person do n't believe it also .
