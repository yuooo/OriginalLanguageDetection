Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat . 
Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge . 
In the course of the defence , the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim . 
con . 
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife 's viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her . 
Erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose-fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman 's property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her . 
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other . 
These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit , -- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it -LRB- the fish -RRB- acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them . 
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs . 
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge , might possibly object to it .
