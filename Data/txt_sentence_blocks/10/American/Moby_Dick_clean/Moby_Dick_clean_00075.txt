But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks . 
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat . 
And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep . 
`` Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul . 
In all his cringing attitudes , the God-fugitive is now too plainly known . 
The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high Heaven , they all-outward to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them . 
The lot is Jonah 's ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions . 
` What is thine occupation ? 
Whence comest thou ? 
Thy country ?
