`` I mean , '' he replied , `` he must show his papers . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind Peleg 's , out of the wigwam . 
`` He must show that he 's converted . 
Son of darkness , '' he added , turning to Queequeg , `` art thou at present in communion with any Christian church ? '' 
`` Why , '' said I , `` he 's a member of the first Congregational Church . '' 
Here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches . 
`` First Congregational Church , '' cried Bildad , `` what ! 
that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman 's meeting-house ? '' 
and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg . 
`` How long hath he been a member ? ''
