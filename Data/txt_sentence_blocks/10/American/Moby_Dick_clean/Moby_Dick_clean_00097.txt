-- how I spurned that turnpike earth ! 
-- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records . 
At the same foam-fountain , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me . 
His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth . 
On , on we flew , and our offing gained , the Moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan . 
Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes . 
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber-like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro . 
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure . 
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back . 
I thought the bumpkin 's hour of doom was come .
