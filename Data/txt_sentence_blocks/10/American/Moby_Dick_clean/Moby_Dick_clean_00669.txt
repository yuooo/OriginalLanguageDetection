And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges , and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces . 
And even if he for ever flies within the gorge , that gorge is in the mountains ; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain , even though they soar . 
The Lamp Had you descended from the Pequod 's try-works to the Pequod 's forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors . 
There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes . 
In merchantmen , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens . 
To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and stumble in darkness to his pallet , this is his usual lot . 
But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light . 
He makes his berth an Aladdin 's lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the pitchiest night the ship 's black hull still houses an illumination . 
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the tryworks , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat . 
He burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore .
