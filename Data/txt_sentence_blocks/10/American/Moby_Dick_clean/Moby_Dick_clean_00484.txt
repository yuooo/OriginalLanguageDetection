It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures . 
A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones , after what might be called the individual life had departed . 
Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin , one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg 's hand off , when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw . 
* The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel ; is about the bigness of a man 's spread hand ; and in general shape , corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower . 
This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally honed , just like a razor . 
In its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle . 
`` Queequeg no care what god made him shark , '' said the savage , agonizingly lifting his hand up and down ; `` wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god ; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin . '' 
Cutting In It was a Saturday night , and such a Sabbath as followed ! 
Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen . 
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher .
