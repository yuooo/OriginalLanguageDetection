Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ? 
I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense . 
I will now refer you to Langsdorff 's Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof . 
Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern 's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century . 
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter : `` By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to Ochotsh . 
The weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing . 
For some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up . 
An uncommonly large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him . 
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water . 
The masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity .
