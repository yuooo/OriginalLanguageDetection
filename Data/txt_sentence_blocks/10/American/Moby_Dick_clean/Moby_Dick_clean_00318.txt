It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas . 
From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime . 
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . 
Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . 
Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress . 
Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God . 
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . 
Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage . 
I can not tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . 
But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this .
