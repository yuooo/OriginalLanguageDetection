`` God bless ye , men . 
Steward ! 
go draw the great measure of grog . 
But what 's this long face about , Mr. Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ! 
art not game for Moby Dick ? '' 
`` I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander 's vengeance . 
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , Captain Ahab ? 
it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market . '' 
`` Nantucket market ! 
Hoot !
