-- the very one ; this one -- I hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now . 
-- Aye and he would fain kill all his crew . 
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ? 
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ? 
and in these same perilous seas , gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log ? 
and in this very Typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods ? 
But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship 's company down to doom with him ? 
-- Yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul swears this ship will , if Ahab have his way . 
If , then , he were this instant -- put aside , that crime would not be his . 
Ha !
