Let 'em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale-boat . 
Shame ! 
shame ! '' 
During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream . 
Pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock . 
But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter 's box ; and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ; -- at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred . 
They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure . 
He answered , certainly . 
In a word , it was Queequeg 's conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere sickness could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , ungovernable , unintelligent destroyer of that sort . 
Now , there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months convalescing , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day .
