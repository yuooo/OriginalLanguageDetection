I thought so . 
Well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the weather bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there . '' 
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest . 
But concentrating all his crow 's feet into one scowl , Captain Peleg started me on the errand . 
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean . 
The prospect was unlimited , but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety that I could see . 
`` Well , what 's the report ? '' 
said Peleg when I came back ; `` what did ye see ? '' 
`` Not much , '' I replied -- `` nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there 's a squall coming up , I think . '' 
`` Well , what dost thou think then of seeing the world ?
