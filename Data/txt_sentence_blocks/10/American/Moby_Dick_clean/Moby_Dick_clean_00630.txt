We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right . 
The law itself has already been set forth . 
But Plowdon gives us the reason for it . 
Says Plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , `` because of its superior excellence . '' 
And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters . 
But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ? 
A reason for that , ye lawyers ! 
In his treatise on `` Queen-Gold , '' or Queen-pin-money , an old King 's Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : `` Ye tail is ye Queen 's , that ye Queen 's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone . '' 
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ' bodices . 
But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne .
