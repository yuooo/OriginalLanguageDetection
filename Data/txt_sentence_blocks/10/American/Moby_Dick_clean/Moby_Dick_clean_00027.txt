Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor Kings do ashore . 
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin . 
The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him . 
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest . 
I began to twitch all over . 
Besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards . 
Suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming ? 
`` Landlord ! 
I 've changed my mind about that harpooneer . 
-- I sha n't sleep with him .
