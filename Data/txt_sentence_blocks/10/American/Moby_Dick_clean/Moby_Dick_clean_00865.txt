He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- We two watchmen never rest . 
Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits , -- the main-mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle , -- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat . 
The clothes that the night had wet , the next day 's sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for . 
He ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , -- breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure . 
But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee 's mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary . 
Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe-struck crew , they seemed pole-like asunder . 
If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange . 
At times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the main-mast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance . 
And yet , somehow , did Ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates , -- Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave . 
Still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib .
