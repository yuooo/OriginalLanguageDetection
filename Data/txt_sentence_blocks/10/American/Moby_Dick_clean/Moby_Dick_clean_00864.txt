As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab 's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew . 
It domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf . 
In this foreshadowing interval , too , all humor , forced or natural , vanished . 
Stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; Starbuck no more strove to check one . 
Alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and powdered , for the time , in the clamped mortar of Ahab 's iron soul . 
Like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man 's despot eye was on them . 
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab 's eyes so awed the crew 's , the inscrutable Parsee 's glance awed his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it . 
Such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being 's body . 
And that shadow was always hovering there . 
For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below .
