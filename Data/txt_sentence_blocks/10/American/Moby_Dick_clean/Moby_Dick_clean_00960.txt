`` There Leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , in the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his breath spouts out a sea . ''

`` So close behind some promontory lie The huge Leviathan to attend their prey , And give no chance , but swallow in the fry , Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way . ''
