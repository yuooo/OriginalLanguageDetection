Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . 
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . 
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . 
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . 
But what is a Gam ? 
You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word , Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster 's ark does not hold it . 
Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees . 
Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon . 
With that view , let me learnedly define it . 
GAM .
