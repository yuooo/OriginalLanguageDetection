Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief-mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod , -- this old Peleg , during the term of his chief-mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake 's carved buckler or bedstead . 
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory . 
She was a thing of trophies . 
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies . 
All round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to . 
Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood , but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory . 
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe . 
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the Tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw . 
A noble craft , but somehow a most melancholy ! 
All noble things are touched with that .
