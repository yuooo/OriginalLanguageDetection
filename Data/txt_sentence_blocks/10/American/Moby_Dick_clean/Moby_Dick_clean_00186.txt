That great America on the other side of the sphere , Australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman . 
After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman , all other ships , long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous ; but the whale-ship touched there . 
The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony . 
Moreover , in the infancy of the first Australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters . 
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth , and do commercial homage to the whale-ship , that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant , and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations . 
If that double-bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold . 
But if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time . 
The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say . 
The whale no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler ? 
Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan ?
