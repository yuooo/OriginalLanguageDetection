While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to Ahab . 
`` Are these thy Mother Carey 's chickens , Perth ? 
they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ; -- look here , they burn ; but thou -- thou liv ` st among them without a scorch . '' 
`` Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab , '' answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; `` I am past scorching - , not easily can ` st thou scorch a scar . '' 
`` Well , well ; no more . 
Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me . 
In no Paradise myself , I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad . 
Thou should ` st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ? 
How can ` st thou endure without being mad ? 
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ` st not go mad ?
