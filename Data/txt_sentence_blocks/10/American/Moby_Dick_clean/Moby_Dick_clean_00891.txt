Their vision was keener than man 's ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea . 
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom . 
It was Moby Dick 's open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea . 
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition . 
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth 's harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern . 
Now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale 's head while yet under water . 
But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat . 
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock . 
The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab 's head , and reached higher than that . 
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse .
