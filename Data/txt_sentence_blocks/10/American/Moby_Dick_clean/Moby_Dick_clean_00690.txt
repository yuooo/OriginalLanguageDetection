Hast seen the White Whale ? '' 
So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colors , bearing down under the stern . 
Trumpet to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-deck , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was carelessly reclining in his own boat 's bow . 
He was a darkly-tanned , burly , goodnatured , fine-looking man , of sixty or thereabouts , dressed in a spacious roundabout , that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth ; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar 's surcoat . 
`` Hast seen the White Whale ! '' 
`` See you this ? '' 
and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet . 
`` Man my boat ! '' 
cried Ahab , impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him -- `` Stand by to lower ! '' 
In less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger .
