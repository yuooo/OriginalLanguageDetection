Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship 's water-line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards . 
`` Screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah 's room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung . 
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance . 
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him . 
The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry . 
` Oh ! 
so my conscience hangs in me ! ' 
he groans , `` straight upward , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! ' 
`` Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there 's naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestling in his berth , Jonah 's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep . 
`` And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish , all careening , glides to sea .
