Of the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman . 
I mean Captain Scoresby . 
On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale , he is the best existing authority . 
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning . 
And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas . 
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales . 
Yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown sperm-whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete . 
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the Greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas . 
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation . 
This is Charing Cross ; hear ye !
