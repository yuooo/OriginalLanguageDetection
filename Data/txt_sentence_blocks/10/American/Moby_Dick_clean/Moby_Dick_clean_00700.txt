No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife , and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system . 
Yes , Captain Boomer , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other , why , in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that 's all . ''

No more White Whales for me ; I 've lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me . 
There would be great glory in killing him , I know that ; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he 's best let alone ; do n't you think so , Captain ? ''

`` He is . 
But he will still be hunted , for all that . 
What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures .
