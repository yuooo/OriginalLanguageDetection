Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb 's whale . 
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning . 
Seizing his sharp boat-spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin . 
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam . 
His boat 's crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold-hunters . 
And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them . 
Stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time . 
`` I have it , I have it , '' cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , `` a purse ! 
a purse ! '' 
Dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal .
