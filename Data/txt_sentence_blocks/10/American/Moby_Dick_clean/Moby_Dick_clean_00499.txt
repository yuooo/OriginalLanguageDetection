A deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes . 
So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had exclaimed -- `` That 's he ! 
that 's he ! 
-- the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho 's company told us of ! '' 
Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho . 
According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam . 
His story was this : He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest-pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum . 
A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common sense exterior , and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam 's whaling voyage . 
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship 's getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet . 
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard .
