thought I. Lo ! 
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship 's stern , with my back to her prow and the compass . 
In an instant I faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her . 
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee ! 
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man ! 
Never dream with thy hand on the helm ! 
Turn not thy back to the compass ; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its redness makes all things look ghastly . 
To-morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp -- all others but liars ! 
Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia 's Dismal Swamp , nor Rome 's accursed Campagna , nor wide Sahara , nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon . 
The sun hides not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth .
