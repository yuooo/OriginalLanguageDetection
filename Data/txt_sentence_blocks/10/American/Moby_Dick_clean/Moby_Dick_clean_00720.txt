The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard-ball . 
I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest 's children , who had stolen them to play marbles with . 
Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child 's play . 
The Fossil Whale From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate . 
Would you , you could not compress him . 
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio . 
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship . 
Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan , it behoves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels . 
Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological , fossiliferous , and antediluvian point of view . 
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent .
