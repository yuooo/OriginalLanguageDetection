murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared . 
`` What 's that he said -- Ahab beware of Ahab -- there 's something there ! '' 
Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck . 
`` Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck , '' he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : `` Furl the t ` gallant-sails , and close-reef the top-sails , fore and aft ; back the main-yard ; up Burtons , and break out in the main-hold . '' 
It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was , that as respecting Starbuck , Ahab thus acted . 
It may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship . 
However it was , his orders were executed ; and the Burtons were hoisted . 
Queequeg in His Coffin Upon searching , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off . 
So , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above . 
So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and corroded , and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted placards , vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood .
