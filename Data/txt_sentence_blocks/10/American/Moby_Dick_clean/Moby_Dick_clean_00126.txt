`` Thou knowest best , '' was the sepulchral reply , `` the seven hundred and seventy-seventh would n't be too much , would it ? 
-- ` where moth and rust do corrupt , but lay - ' '' Lay , indeed , thought I , and such a lay ! 
the seven hundred and seventy-seventh ! 
Well , old Bildad , you are determined that I , for one , shall not lay up many lays here below , where moth and rust do corrupt . 
It was an exceedingly long lay that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a teenth of it , you will then see , I say , that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons ; and so I thought at the time . 
`` Why , blast your eyes , Bildad , '' cried Peleg , Thou dost not want to swindle this young man ! 
he must have more than that . '' 
`` Seven hundred and seventy-seventh , '' again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling -- `` for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . '' 
`` I am going to put him down for the three hundredth , '' said Peleg , `` do ye hear that , Bildad ! 
The three hundredth lay , I say . ''
