Reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale 's skin . 
In life , the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents . 
Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest Italian line engravings . 
But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself . 
Nor is this all . 
In some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations . 
These are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion . 
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi . 
Like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable . 
This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing .
