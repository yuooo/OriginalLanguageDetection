What people ? 
But mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor Jonah . 
The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him . '' ' 
I am a Hebrew , ' he cries -- and then -- ' I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land ! ' 
Fear him , O Jonah ? 
Aye , well mightest thou fear the Lord God then ! 
Straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful . 
For when Jonah , not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts , -- when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship . 
But all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to God , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah . 
`` And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as Jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind .
