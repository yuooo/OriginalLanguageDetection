-- Why then do you try to `` enlarge '' your mind ? 
Subtilize it . 
Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale 's head , so , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach . 
But let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are . 
What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth ! 
from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins . 
But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side . 
If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas ! 
it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force . 
But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right-angles with his body ; for all the world like a ship 's jibboom .
