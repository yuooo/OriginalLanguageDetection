Blood and thunder ! 
-- jump ! '' 
-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes . 
Now in getting under weigh , the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship . 
And here Bildad , who , with Peleg , be it known , in addition to his other offices , was one of the licensed pilots of the port -- he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never piloted any other craft -- Bildad , I say , might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley , with hearty good will . 
Nevertheless , not three days previous , Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and Charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman 's berth . 
Meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner . 
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my handspike , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot . 
I was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . 
That was my first kick .
