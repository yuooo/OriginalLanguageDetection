There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead . 
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull . 
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner . 
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back . 
I am no coward , but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension . 
Ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night . 
In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him . 
Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms . 
As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face , his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt . 
Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms .
