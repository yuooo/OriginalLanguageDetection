I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile . 
At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night 's hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows . 
I told him yes ; whereat I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented . 
We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . 
Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town . 
Soon I proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff . 
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us . 
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan 's breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies . 
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country 's phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be . 
In a countryman , this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply .
