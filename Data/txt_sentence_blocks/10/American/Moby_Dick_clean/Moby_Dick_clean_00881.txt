Is it I , God , or who , that lifts this arm ? 
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand-boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I. By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the handspike . 
And all the time , lo ! 
that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea ! 
Look ! 
see yon Albicore ! 
who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish ? 
Where do murderers go , man ! 
Who 's to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ? 
But it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the airs smells now , as if it blew from a far-away meadow ; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes , Starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay .
