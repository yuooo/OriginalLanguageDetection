This peculiarity of the whale 's eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes . 
A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan . 
But I must be content with a hint . 
So long as a man 's eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he can not then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him . 
Nevertheless , any one 's experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other . 
But if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness . 
How is it , then , with the whale ? 
True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man 's , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ? 
If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid . 
Nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison .
