At last his spout grew thick , and with a frightful roll and vomit , he turned upon his back a corpse . 
While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some conversation ensued between them . 
`` I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard , '' said Stubb , not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan . 
`` Wants with it ? '' 
said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat 's bow , `` did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale 's head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale 's on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ? '' 
`` Why not ? 
`` I do n't know , but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ' charms . 
But I sometimes think he 'll charm the ship to no good at last . 
I do n't half like that chap , Stubb . 
Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake 's head , Stubb ? ''
