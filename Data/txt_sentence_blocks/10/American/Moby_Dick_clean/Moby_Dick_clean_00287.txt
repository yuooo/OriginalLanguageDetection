Strike the bell eight , thou Pip ! 
thou blackling ! 
and let me call the watch . 
I 've the sort of mouth for that -- the hogshead mouth . 
So , so , -LRB- thrusts his head down the scuttle , -RRB- Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s , a-h-o-y ! 
Eight bells there below ! 
Tumble up ! 
DUTCH SAILOR Grand snoozing to-night , maty ; fat night for that .
