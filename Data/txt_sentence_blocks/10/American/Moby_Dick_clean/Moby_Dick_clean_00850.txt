Here we go again . 
This wooden mallet is the cork , and I 'm the professor of musical glasses -- tap , tap ! '' 
-LRB- Ahab to himself -RRB- `` There 's a sight ! 
There 's a sound ! 
The greyheaded wood-pecker tapping the hollow tree ! 
Blind and dumb might well be envied now . 
See ! 
that thing rests on two line-tubs , full of tow-lines . 
A most malicious wag , that fellow . 
Rat-tat !
