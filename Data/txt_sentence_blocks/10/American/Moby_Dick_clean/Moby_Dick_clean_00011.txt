With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote . 
I love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts . 
Not ignoring what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in . 
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air . 
The Carpet-Bag I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific . 
Quitting the good city of old Manhatto , I duly arrived in New Bedford . 
It was on a Saturday night in December . 
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following Monday . 
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing . 
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me .
