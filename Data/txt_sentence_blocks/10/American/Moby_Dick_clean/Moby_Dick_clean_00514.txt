-- what the devil is ginger , I say , that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here . '' 
`` There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business , '' he suddenly added , now approaching Starbuck , who had just come from forward . 
`` Will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please . '' 
Then watching the mate 's countenance , he added , `` The steward , Mr. Starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg , there , this instant off the whale . 
Is the steward an apothecary , sir ? 
and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man ? '' 
`` I trust not , '' said Starbuck , `` it is poor stuff enough . '' 
`` Aye , aye , steward , '' cried Stubb , `` we 'll teach you to drug it harpooneer ; none of your apothecary 's medicine here ; you want to poison us , do ye ? 
You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars , and pocket the proceeds , do ye ? '' 
`` It was not me , '' cried Dough-Boy , `` it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this ginger-jub -- so she called it . ''
