Were ever such things done before with a coffin ? 
Some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job . 
But I 'm made of knotty Aroostook hemlock ; I do n't budge . 
Cruppered with a coffin ! 
Sailing about with a grave-yard tray ! 
But never mind . 
We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables , as well as coffins and hearses . 
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can . 
Hem ! 
I 'll do the job , now , tenderly .
