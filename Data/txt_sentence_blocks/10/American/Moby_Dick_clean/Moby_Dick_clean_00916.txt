Ahab is for ever Ahab , man . 
This whole act 's immutably decreed . 
'T was rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled . 
Fool ! 
I am the Fates ' lieutenant ; I act under orders . 
Look thou , underling ! 
that thou obeyest mine . 
-- Stand round men , men . 
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered lance ; propped up on a lonely foot . 
'T is Ahab -- his body 's part ; but Ahab 's soul 's a centipede , that moves upon a hundred legs .
