`` It 's very queer . 
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I do n't well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what 's that ? 
-- down here on my knees and pray for him ? 
Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever did pray . 
It 's queer ; very queer ; and he 's queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he 's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with . 
How he flashed at me ! 
-- his eyes like powder-pans ! 
is he mad ! 
Anyway there 's something 's on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks . 
He aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty-four ; and he do n't sleep then .
