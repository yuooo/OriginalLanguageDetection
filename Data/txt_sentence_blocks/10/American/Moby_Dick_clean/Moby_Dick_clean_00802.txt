leap up , and lick the sky ! 
I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly I worship thee ! '' 
`` The boat ! 
the boat ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` look at thy boat , old man ! '' 
Ahab 's harpoon , the one forged at Perth 's fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it projected beyond his whale-boat 's bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire . 
As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent 's tongue , Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm -- `` God , God is against thee , old man ; forbear ! ' 
t is an ill voyage ! 
ill begun , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it homewards , to go on a better voyage than this . '' 
Overhearing Starbuck , the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft .
