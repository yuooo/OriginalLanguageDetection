And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship-owners of Nantucket ! 
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head . 
Beware of such an one , I say : your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer . 
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded . 
For nowadays , the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent-minded young men , disgusted with the corking care of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber . 
Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates : -- `` Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! 
Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain . '' 
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient `` interest '' in the voyage ; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . 
But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? 
They have left their opera-glasses at home .
