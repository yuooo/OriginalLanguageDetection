Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of 'em . 
But that 's against my principles . 
Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again . 
But how 's that ? 
did n't he call me a dog ? 
blazes ! 
he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that ! 
He might as well have kicked me , and done with it . 
Maybe he did kick me , and I did n't observe it , I was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow . 
It flashed like a bleached bone .
