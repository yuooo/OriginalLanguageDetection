-- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar ! 
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheelspokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there 's danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill . 
Hurrah ! 
this is the way a fellow feels when he 's going to Davy Jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane ! 
Hurrah ! 
this whale carries the everlasting mail ! '' 
But the monster 's run was a brief one . 
Giving a sudden gasp , he tumultuously sounded . 
With a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air . 
And the whale soon ceasing to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of expending more line , though the position was a little ticklish .
