Like the great dome of St. Peter 's , and like the great whale , retain , O man ! 
in all seasons a temperature of thine own . 
But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things ! 
Of erections , how few are domed like St. Peter 's ! 
of creatures , how few vast as the whale ! 
The Funeral Haul in the chains ! 
Let the carcase go astern ! 
The vast tackles have now done their duty . 
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre ; though changed in hue , it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk . 
It is still colossal .
