`` Start her , now ; give 'em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego . 
Start her , Tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that 's all . 
Start her ! '' 
`` Woo-hoo ! 
Wa-hee ! '' 
screamed the Gay-Header in reply , raising some old war-whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave . 
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild . 
`` Kee-hee ! 
Kee-hee ! '' 
yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage .
