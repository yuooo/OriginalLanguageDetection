He now perceived that the Guernsey-man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting-spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag . 
`` What 's the matter with your nose , there ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Broke it ? '' 
`` I wish it was broken , or that I did n't have any nose at all ! '' 
answered the Guernsey-man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much . 
`` But what are you holding yours for ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing ! 
It 's a wax nose ; I have to hold it on . 
Fine day , ai n't it ?
