Now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg 's pagan arm thrown round me . 
But at length all the past night 's events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament . 
For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain . 
I now strove to rouse him -- `` Queequeg ! '' 
-- but his only answer was a snore . 
I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch . 
Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage 's side , as if it were a hatchet-faced baby . 
A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk ! 
`` Queequeg ! 
-- in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake ! ''
