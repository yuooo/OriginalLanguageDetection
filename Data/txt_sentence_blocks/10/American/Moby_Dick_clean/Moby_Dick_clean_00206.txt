Old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death . 
Among sea-commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck . 
It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks . 
`` It feels like going down into one 's tomb , '' -- he would mutter to himself -- `` for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave-dug berth . '' 
So , almost every twenty-four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way . 
Some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks . 
But once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , Stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , and with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel . 
Ah ! 
Stubb , thou didst not know Ahab then . 
`` Am I a cannon-ball , Stubb , '' said Ahab , `` that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ?
