`` I ca n't see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me onto that . '' 
Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal . 
`` Good a mast-head as any , sir . 
Will you mount ? '' 
`` That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet taller . '' 
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask 's foot , and then putting Flask 's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders . 
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . 
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas . 
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the logger head itself , under such circumstances . 
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form .
