For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man 's valor , that man 's fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to .

Clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate .

`` Why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ? '' 
cried Ahab , when , after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard . 
`` Sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears . ''
