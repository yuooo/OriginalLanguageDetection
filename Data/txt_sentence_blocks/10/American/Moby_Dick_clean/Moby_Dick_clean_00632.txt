I thought they would keel up before long . '' 
Presently , the vapors in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside . 
As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colors from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse . 
It may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed . 
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it . 
Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose . 
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first . 
In truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil . 
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general . 
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
