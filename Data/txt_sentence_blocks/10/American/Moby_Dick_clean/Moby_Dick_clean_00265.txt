And what is it ? 
Reckon it . 
'T is but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck . 
What is it more ? 
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone . 
Ah ! 
constrainings seize thee ; I see ! 
the billow lifts thee ! 
Speak , but speak ! 
-- Aye , aye !
