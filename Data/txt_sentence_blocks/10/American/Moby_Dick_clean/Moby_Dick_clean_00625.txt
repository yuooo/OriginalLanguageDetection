What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast-Fish ? 
And concerning all these , is not Possession the whole of the law ? 
But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so . 
That is internationally and universally applicable . 
What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish , in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of wailing it for his royal master and mistress ? 
What was Poland to the Czar ? 
What Greece to the Turk ? 
What India to England ? 
What at last will Mexico be to the United States ? 
All Loose-Fish .
