Certainly it can not be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear 's oil , nor train oil , nor cod-liver oil .

Knights and Squires The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck , a native of Nantucket , and a Quaker by descent . 
He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit .

Only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness . 
But this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight .
