As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship . 
Meantime , Ahab holding the letter , muttered , `` Mr. Har -- yes , Mr. Harry -- -LRB- a woman 's pinny hand , -- the man 's wife , I 'll wager -RRB- -- Aye -- Mr. Harry Macey , Ship Jeroboam ; why it 's Macey , and he 's dead ! '' 
`` Poor fellow ! 
poor fellow ! 
and from his wife , '' sighed Mayhew ; `` but let me have it . '' 
`` Nay , keep it thyself , '' cried Gabriel to Ahab ; `` thou art soon going that way . '' 
`` Curses throttle thee ! '' 
yelled Ahab . 
`` Captain Mayhew , stand by now to receive it '' ; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck 's hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat . 
But as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship 's stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel 's eager hand .
