All sail being set , he now cast loose the life-line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail , he raised a gull-like cry in the air . 
`` There she blows ! 
-- there she blows ! 
A hump like a snow-hill ! 
It is Moby Dick ! '' 
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing . 
Ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look-outs , Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast , so that the Indian 's head was almost on a level with Ahab 's heel . 
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air . 
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans . 
`` And did none of ye see it before ? ''
