No roses , no violets , no Cologne-water in the sea . 
Furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal -- like the grand Erie Canal -- is furnished with a sort of locks -LRB- that open and shut -RRB- for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose . 
But then again , what has the whale to say ? 
Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living . 
Oh ! 
happy that the world is such an excellent listener ! 
Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street . 
But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle . 
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it can not be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle . 
Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water .
