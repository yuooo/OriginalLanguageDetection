All Astir A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod . 
Not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship 's preparations were hurrying to a close . 
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall . 
On the day following Queequeg 's signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship 's company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing . 
So Queequeg and I got down our traps , resolving , however , to sleep ashore till the last . 
But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases , and the ship did not sail for several days . 
But no wonder ; there was a good deal to be done , and there is no telling how many things to be thought of , before the Pequod was fully equipped . 
Every one knows what a multitude of things -- beds , sauce-pans , knives and forks , shovels and tongs , napkins , nut-crackers , and what not , are indispensable to the business of housekeeping . 
Just so with whaling , which necessitates a three-years ' housekeeping upon the wide ocean , far from all grocers , costermongers , doctors , bakers , and bankers . 
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen .
