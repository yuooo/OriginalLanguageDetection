`` They will last long enough ! 
pull on ! 
-- But who can tell '' -- he muttered -- `` whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ? 
-- But pull on ! 
Aye , all alive , now -- we near him . 
The helm ! 
take the helm ! 
let me pass , '' -- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat . 
At length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the White Whale 's flank , he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale 's spout , curled round his great Monadnock hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise , he darted his fierce iron , and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale . 
As both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , Moby Dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
