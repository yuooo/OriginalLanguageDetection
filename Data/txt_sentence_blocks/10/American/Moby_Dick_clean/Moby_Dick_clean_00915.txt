I 'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I 'll slay him yet ! 
`` Great God ! 
but for one single instant show thyself , '' cried Starbuck ; `` never , never wilt thou capture him , old man -- In Jesus ' name no more of this , that 's worse than devil 's madness . 
Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings : -- what more wouldst thou have ? 
-- Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ? 
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ? 
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ? 
Oh , oh , -- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more ! '' 
`` Starbuck , of late I 've felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know ` st what , in one another 's eyes . 
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless , unfeatured blank .
