My sensations were strange . 
Let me try to explain them . 
When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle . 
The circumstance was this . 
I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless , -- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere . 
I felt dreadfully . 
But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets . 
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection . 
Sixteen hours in bed ! 
the small of my back ached to think of it .
