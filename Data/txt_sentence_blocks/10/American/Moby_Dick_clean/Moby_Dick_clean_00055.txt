Ah , poor Hay-Seed ! 
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest . 
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . 
Not at all . 
Still New Bedford is a queer place . 
Had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador . 
As it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony . 
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England . 
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine . 
The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs .
