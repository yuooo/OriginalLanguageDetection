If hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right , the merry May-day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to Jove 's high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it . 
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics . 
But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man 's and every being 's face . 
Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable . 
If then , Sir William Jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant 's face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale 's brow ? 
I but put that brow before you . 
Read if it if you can . 
The Nut If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square . 
In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length . 
Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side view of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base .
