It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable . 
The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast , to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house . 
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach . 
But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast-head , that of a whale-ship at sea . 
The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set ; the seamen taking their regular turns -LRB- as at the helm -RRB- , and relieving each other every two hours . 
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head : nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful . 
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes . 
There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves . 
The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor . 
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .
