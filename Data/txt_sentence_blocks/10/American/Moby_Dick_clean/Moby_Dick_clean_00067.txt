But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . 
And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists . 
`` With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him . 
He thinks that a ship made by men , will carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth . 
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that 's bound for Tarshish . 
There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here . 
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz . 
That 's the opinion of learned men . 
And where is Cadiz , shipmates ? 
Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by water , from Joppa , as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea .
