Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is , to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams . 
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills . 
Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air . 
From this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck . 
His life , as they significantly call it , was untouched . 
As the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed . 
His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld . 
As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale 's eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see . 
But pity there was none . 
For all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all .
