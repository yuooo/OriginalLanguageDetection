`` Aye , aye , sir , '' and straightway Starbuck did Ahab 's bidding , and once more Ahab swung on high . 
A whole hour now passed ; gold-beaten out to ages . 
Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense . 
But at last , some three points off the weather bow , Ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it . 
`` Forehead to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick ! 
On deck there ! 
-- brace sharper up ; crowd her into the wind 's eye . 
He 's too far off to lower yet , Mr. Starbuck . 
The sails shake ! 
Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul !
