Give way ! '' 
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship 's company ; but Archy 's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event . 
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb 's confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab 's precise agency in the matter from the beginning . 
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah . 
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him . 
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer . 
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer 's , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him . 
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat 's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . 
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea . 
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way .
