`` I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out , '' said Tashtego . 
`` Not the same instant ; not the same -- no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me .

There she blows ! 
there she blows ! 
-- there she blows ! 
-- there she blows ! 
There again ! 
-- there again ! ''
