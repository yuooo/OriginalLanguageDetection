That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster , which gives us the dread Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos ; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord ; -- Vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale . 
When Brahma , or the God of Gods , saith the Shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to Vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the Vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes . 
Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman , then ? 
even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ? 
Perseus , St. George , Hercules , Jonah , and Vishnoo ! 
there 's a member-roll for you ! 
What club but the whaleman 's can head off like that ? 
Jonah Historically Regarded Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter . 
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale . 
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale , and Arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that .
