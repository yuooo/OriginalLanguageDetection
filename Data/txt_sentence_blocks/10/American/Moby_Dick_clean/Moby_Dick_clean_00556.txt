For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects . 
While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern . 
`` What has he in his hand there ? '' 
cried Starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the German . 
`` Impossible ! 
-- a lamp-feeder ! ''
