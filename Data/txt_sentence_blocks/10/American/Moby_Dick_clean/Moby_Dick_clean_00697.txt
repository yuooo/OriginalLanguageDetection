`` My captain , you must have ere this perceived , respected sir '' -- said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab -- `` is apt to be facetious at times ; he spins us many clever things of that sort . 
But I may as well say -- en passant , as the French remark -- that I myself -- that is to say , Jack Bunger , late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man ; I never drink - '' `` Water ! '' 
cried the captain ; `` he never drinks it ; it 's a sort of fits to him ; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia ; but go on -- go on with the arm story . '' 
`` Yes , I may as well , '' said the surgeon , coolly . 
`` I was about observing , sir , before Captain Boomer 's facetious interruption , that spite of my best and severest endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long . 
I measured it with the lead line . 
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came . 
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule '' -- pointing at it with the marlingspike -- `` that is the captain 's work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club-hammer there put to the end , to knock some one 's brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once . 
He flies into diabolical passions sometimes . 
Do ye see this dent , sir '' -- removing his hat , and brushing aside his hair , and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry trace , or any token of ever having been a wound -- `` Well , the captain there will tell you how that came there ; he knows . ''
