By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward . 
`` Aye , aye , '' said Stubb , the second mate , `` Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you 'll find anywhere in this fishery . '' 
But we shall ere long see what that word `` careful '' precisely means when used by a man like Stubb , or almost any other whale hunter . 
Starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions . 
Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted . 
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him . 
For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew . 
What doom was his own father 's ? 
Where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ? 
With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck , which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme .
