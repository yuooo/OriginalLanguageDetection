Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him , and chases him away ! 
High times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the Bashaw will , he can not keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed ; for alas ! 
all fish bed in common . 
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love . 
They fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers . 
Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters , -- furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths . 
But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem 's lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord . 
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines . 
Granting other whales to be in sight , the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks ; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small . 
As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help .
