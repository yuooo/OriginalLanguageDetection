Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause . 
Thrusting his head half-way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger . 
Standing behind him Starbuck looked , and lo ! 
the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West . 
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , `` I have it ! 
It has happened before . 
Mr. Starbuck , last night 's thunder turned our compasses -- that 's all . 
Thou hast before now heard of such a thing , I take it . '' 
`` Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir , '' said the pale mate , gloomily . 
Here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms .
