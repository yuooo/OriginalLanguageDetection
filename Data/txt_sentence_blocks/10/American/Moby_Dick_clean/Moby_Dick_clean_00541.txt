A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides . 
The lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent . 
The upper part , known as the Case , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale . 
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale 's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun . 
Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly-prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state . 
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature . 
Though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . 
A large whale 's case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can . 
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-colored membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale 's case . 
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship 's side .
