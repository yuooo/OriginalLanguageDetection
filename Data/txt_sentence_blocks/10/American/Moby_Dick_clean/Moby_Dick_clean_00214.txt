And there 's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump . 
That 's what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane . 
The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man . 
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ` what 's his leg now , but a cane - . 
a whale-bone cane . 
Yes , ' thinks I , ` it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick . 
Besides , ' thinks I , ` look at it once ; why , the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , there 's a devilish broad insult . 
But this insult is whittled down to a point only . ' 
But now comes the greatest joke of the dream , Flask . 
While I was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger-haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round .
