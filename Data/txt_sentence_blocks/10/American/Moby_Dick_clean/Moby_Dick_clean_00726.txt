Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale . 
And I have heard , on whalemen 's authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture . 
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam 's time they have degenerated ? 
Assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally . 
For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales ! 
And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke 's naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales -LRB- reydan-siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies -RRB- at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet . 
And Lacepede , the French naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work -LRB- page 3 -RRB- , sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty-eight feet . 
And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825 . 
But will any whaleman believe these stories ? 
No .
