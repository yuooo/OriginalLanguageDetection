Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn-cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon .

What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights ! 
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals .
