he then said , turning to me ; `` not very long , I rather guess , young man . '' 
`` No , '' said Peleg , `` and he has n't been baptized right either , or it would have washed some of that devil 's blue off his face . '' 
`` Do tell , now , '' cried Bildad , `` is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy 's meeting ? 
I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord 's day . '' 
`` I do n't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting , '' said I ; `` all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church . 
He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is . '' 
`` Young man , '' said Bildad sternly , `` thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young Hittite . 
What church dost thee mean ? 
answer me . '' 
Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied , `` I mean , sir , the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother 's son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in that we all join hands .
