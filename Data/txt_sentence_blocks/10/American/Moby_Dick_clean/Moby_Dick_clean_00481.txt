In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish . 
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn -LRB- precisely resembling two large puddings -RRB- , they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf 's head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination . 
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf 's head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see . 
The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an `` Et tu Brute ! '' 
expression . 
It is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light . 
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does . 
Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds . 
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal 's jaw ? 
Cannibals ?
