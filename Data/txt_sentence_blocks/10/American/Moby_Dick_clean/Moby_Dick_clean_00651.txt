It was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ! 
the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold-beater 's skin hammered out to the extremest . 
Bobbing up and down in that sea , Pip 's ebon head showed like a head of cloves . 
No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern . 
Stubb 's inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged . 
In three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb . 
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest . 
Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore . 
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable . 
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God !
