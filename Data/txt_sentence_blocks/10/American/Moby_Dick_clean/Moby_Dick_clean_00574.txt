No use prying there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife , and cut the big chains . '' 
`` Knife ? 
Aye , aye , '' cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter 's heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke-chains . 
But a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest . 
With a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank . 
Now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it . 
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface . 
If the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken-hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him . 
But it is not so . 
For young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life , with all their panting lard about them !
