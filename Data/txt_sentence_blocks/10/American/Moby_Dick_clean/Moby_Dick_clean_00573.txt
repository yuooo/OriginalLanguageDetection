But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship 's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body 's immensely increasing tendency to sink . 
However , Starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off . 
Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant . 
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house . 
The ship groaned and gasped . 
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation . 
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over . 
`` Hold on , hold on , wo n't ye ? '' 
cried Stubb to the body , `` do n't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink ! 
By thunder , men , we must do something or go for it .
