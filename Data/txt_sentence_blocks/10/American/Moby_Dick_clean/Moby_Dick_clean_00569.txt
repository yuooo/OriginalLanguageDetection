In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army . 
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head ! 
`` Stand by , men ; he stirs , '' cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat . 
The next moment , relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea . 
`` Haul in ! 
Haul in ! '' 
cried Starbuck again ; `` he 's rising . '' 
The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand 's breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship 's length of the hunters . 
His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion . 
In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions .
