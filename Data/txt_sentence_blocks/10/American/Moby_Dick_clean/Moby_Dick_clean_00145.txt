But when a man 's religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in ; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him . 
And just so I now did with Queequeg . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , `` get into bed now , and lie and listen to me . '' 
I then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions , and coming down to the various religions of the present time , during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents , Ramadans , and prolonged ham-squattings in cold , cheerless rooms were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense . 
I told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his . 
Besides , argued I , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved . 
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters . 
In one word , Queequeg , said I , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans . 
I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in . 
He said no ; only upon one memorable occasion .
