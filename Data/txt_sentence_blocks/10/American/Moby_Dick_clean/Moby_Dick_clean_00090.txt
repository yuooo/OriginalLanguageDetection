For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . 
I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord 's policy of insurance . 
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . 
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp . 
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it . 
He gladly complied . 
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give . 
Biographical Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko , an island far away to the West and South . 
It is not down on any map ; true places never are . 
When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in Queequeg 's ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two .
