Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders . 
Do ye hear ? 
Hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ` other a ` top of your heart , when I 'm giving my orders , cook . 
What ! 
that your heart , there ? 
-- that 's your gizzard ! 
Aloft ! 
aloft ! 
-- that 's it -- now you have it . 
Hold it there now , and pay attention . ''
