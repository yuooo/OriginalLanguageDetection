Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people 's noses .

Well , then , will it speak thoroughly well for thy work , if , when I come to mount this leg thou makest , I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it ; that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , I mean . 
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away ? 
Truly , sir , I begin to understand somewhat now .
