names of Fin-Back , Tall-Spout , and Long-John , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic , in the New York packet-tracks . 
In the length he attains , and in his baleen , the Fin-back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter color , approaching to olive . 
His great lips present a cable-like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles . 
His grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object . 
This fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end . 
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface . 
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it . 
On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back . 
The Fin-Back is not gregarious . 
He seems a whale-hater , as some men are man-haters .
