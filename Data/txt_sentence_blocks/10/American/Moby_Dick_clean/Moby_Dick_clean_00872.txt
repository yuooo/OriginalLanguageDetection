Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us ! 
Sweet childhood of air and sky ! 
how oblivious were ye of old Ahab 's close-coiled woe ! 
But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha , laughing-eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain . 
Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity . 
But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul . 
That glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step-mother world , so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless . 
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop . 
Starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around . 
Careful not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there .
