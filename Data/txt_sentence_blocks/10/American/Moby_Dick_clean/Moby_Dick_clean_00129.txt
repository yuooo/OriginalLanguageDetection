Bildad , thou used to be good at sharpening a lance , mend that pen , will ye . 
My jack-knife here needs the grindstone . 
That 's he ; thank ye , Bildad . 
Now then , my young man , Ishmael 's thy name , did n't ye say ? 
Well then , down ye go here , Ishmael , for the three hundredth lay . '' 
`` Captain Peleg , '' said I , `` I have a friend with me who wants to ship too -- shall I bring him down to-morrow ? '' 
`` To be sure , '' said Peleg . 
`` Fetch him along , and we 'll look at him . '' 
`` What lay does he want ? '' 
groaned Bildad , glancing up from the Book in which he had again been burying himself .
