For , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends ; fast to Queequeg 's broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one . 
So that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honor demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake . 
So , then , an elongated Siamese ligature united us . 
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed . 
So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another 's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death . 
Therefore , I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence ; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice . 
And yet still further pondering -- while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering , I say , I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals . 
If your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die . 
True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life . 
But handle Queequeg 's monkey-rope heedfully as I would , sometimes he jerked it so , that I came very near sliding overboard .
