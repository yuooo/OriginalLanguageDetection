But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ? 
-- heard nothing about that , eh ? 
Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ? 
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy . 
Did n't ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ? 
No , I do n't think ye did ; how could ye ? 
Who knows it ? 
Not all Nantucket , I guess . 
But hows ` ever , mayhap , ye 've heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , I dare say . 
Oh , yes , that every one knows a ` most -- I mean they know he 's only one leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off . ''
