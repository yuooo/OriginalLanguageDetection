` Very good , ' says he -- ` he used his ivory leg , did n't he ? ' 
` Yes , he did , ' says I. ` Well then , ' says he , ` wise Stubb , what have you to complain of ? 
Did n't he kick with right good will ? 
it was n't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ? 
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb . 
It 's an honor ; I consider it an honor . 
Listen , wise Stubb . 
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter-knights of ; but , be your boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of . 
Remember what I say ; be kicked by him ; account his kicks honors ; and on no account kick back ; for you ca n't help yourself , wise Stubb . 
Do n't you see that pyramid ? '
