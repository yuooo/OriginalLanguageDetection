It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream . 
The more I consider this mighty tail , the more do I deplore my inability to express it . 
At times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable . 
In an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world . 
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant . 
Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep . 
I know him not , and never will . 
But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ? 
much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ? 
Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
