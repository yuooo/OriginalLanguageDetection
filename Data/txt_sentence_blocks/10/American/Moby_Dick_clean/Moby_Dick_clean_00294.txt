3D NANTUCKET SAILOR Spell oh ! 
-- whew ! 
this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm -- give us a whiff , Tash . 
-LRB- They cease dancing , and gather in clusters . 
Meantime the sky darkens -- the wind rises . -RRB- 
LASCAR SAILOR By Brahma ! 
boys , it 'll be douse sail soon . 
The sky-born , high-tide Ganges turned to wind ! 
Thou showest thy black brow , Seeva ! 
MALTESE SAILOR -LRB- Reclining and shaking his cap -RRB- It 's the waves -- the snow 's caps turn to jig it now .
