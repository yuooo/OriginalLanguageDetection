What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . 
And poor little Flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party . 
His were the shin-bones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks . 
For Flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree . 
Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him . 
And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it . 
Least of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter . 
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , Flask , alas ! 
was a butterless man ! 
Another thing .
