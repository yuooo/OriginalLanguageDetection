So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world . 
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat . 
How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends . 
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning . 
Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair . 
Nightgown We had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our confabulations , what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though day-break was yet some way down the future . 
Yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our knee-pans were warming-pans . 
We felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed-clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room . 
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . 
Nothing exists in itself .
