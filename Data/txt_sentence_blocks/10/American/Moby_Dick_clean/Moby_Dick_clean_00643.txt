You might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash color . 
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist . 
Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab 's loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good-bye . 
Ambergris Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject . 
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned . 
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct . 
For amber , though at times found on the sea-coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea . 
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth-pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair-powders , and pomatum . 
The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter 's in Rome . 
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it .
