The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , Queequeg 's tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body . 
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall . 
A moment or two passed , when Starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one . 
It was Stubb . 
`` What thinkest thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song . '' 
`` No , no , it was n't ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still . 
But do they only have mercy on long faces ? 
-- have they no bowels for a laugh ? 
And look ye , Mr. Starbuck -- but it 's too dark to look . 
Hear me , then ; I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a ' block with sperm-oil , d'ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like sap in a tree .
