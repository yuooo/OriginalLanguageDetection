to think 's audacity . 
God only has that right and privilege . 
Thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that . 
And yet , I 've sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it . 
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it 's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava . 
How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to . 
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces . 
Out upon it ! 
-- it 's tainted . 
Were I the wind , I 'd blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
