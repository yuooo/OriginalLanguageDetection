cried Daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses . 
`` Swing the bucket this way ! '' 
and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom . 
Meantime , there was a terrible tumult . 
Looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk . 
At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg . 
The one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head . 
`` Come down , come down ! '' 
yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out . 
`` In heaven 's name , man , '' cried Stubb , `` are you ramming home a cartridge there ?
