`` Splice , thou mean ` st splice hands , '' cried Peleg , drawing nearer . 
`` Young man , you 'd better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore-mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon . 
Deacon Deuteronomy -- why Father Mapple himself could n't beat it , and he 's reckoned something . 
Come aboard , come aboard : never mind about the papers . 
I say , tell Quohog there -- what 's that you call him ? 
tell Quohog to step along . 
By the great anchor , what a harpoon he 's got there ! 
looks like good stuff that ; and he handles it about right . 
I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat ? 
did you ever strike a fish ? ''
