Why did Louis XVI of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ? 
Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1,000,000 pounds ? 
And lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 00824,000,000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , 20,000,000 dollars ; and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 00847,000,000 dollars . 
How comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ? 
But this is not the half ; look again . 
I freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher can not , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling . 
One way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb . 
It would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things . 
Let a handful suffice . 
For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth .
