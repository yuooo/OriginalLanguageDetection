It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time . 
Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots . 
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron . 
The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck , by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works . 
By a tunnel inserted at the rear , this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates . 
There are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall . 
And here let us go back for a moment . 
It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod 's try-works were first started on this present voyage . 
It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business . 
`` All ready there ?
