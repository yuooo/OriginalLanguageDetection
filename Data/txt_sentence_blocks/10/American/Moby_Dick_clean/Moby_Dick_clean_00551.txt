For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men . 
Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so . 
In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi-crescentic depression in the forehead 's middle , which , in a man , is Lavater 's mark of genius . 
But how ? 
Genius in the Sperm Whale ? 
Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ? 
No , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it . 
It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence . 
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World , he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts . 
They deified the crocodile of the Nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion .
