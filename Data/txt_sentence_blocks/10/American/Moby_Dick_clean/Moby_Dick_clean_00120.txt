Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it , eh ?

I was a little staggered , but go a-whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any -- I thought the best -- and all this I now repeated to Peleg . 
Seeing me so determined , he expressed his willingness to ship me . 
`` And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off , '' he added -- `` come along with ye . '' 
And so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin . 
Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure . 
It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship . 
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest . 
Now , Bildad , like Peleg , and indeed many other Nantucketers , was a Quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous .
