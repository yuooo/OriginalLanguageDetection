And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts , candelabra-wise , proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . 
So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation 's final day . 
And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses . 
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens . 
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye can not , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands . 
The Chapel In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman 's Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot . 
I am sure that I did not . 
Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand . 
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist . 
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , I fought my way against the stubborn storm .
