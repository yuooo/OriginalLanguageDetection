It was the magical line . 
An instant before , Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe . 
As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb 's hands , from which the hand-cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped . 
It was like holding an enemy 's sharp two-edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch . 
`` Wet the line ! 
wet the line ! '' 
cried Stubb to the tub oarsman -LRB- him seated by the tub -RRB- who , snatching off his hat , dashed the sea-water into it . 
* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place . 
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins . 
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion .
