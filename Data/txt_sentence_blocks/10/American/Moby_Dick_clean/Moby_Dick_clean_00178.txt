For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hardearned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him , -- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , `` Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can . '' 
As for Peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye , when the lantern came too near . 
And he , too , did not a little run from the cabin to deck -- now a word below , and now a word with Starbuck , the chief mate . 
But , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him , -- `` Captain Bildad -- come , old shipmate , we must go . 
Back the mainyard there ! 
Boat ahoy ! 
Stand by to come close alongside , now ! 
Careful , careful ! 
-- come , Bildad , boy -- say your last . 
Luck to ye , Starbuck -- luck to ye , Mr. Stubb -- luck to ye , Mr. Flask -- good-bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years I 'll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket .
