Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i.e. what is called savagery . 
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois . 
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . 
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . 
An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon .

Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers . 
Some of them are done with much accuracy .
