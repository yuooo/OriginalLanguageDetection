I 'll have me -- let 's see -- how many in the ship 's company , all told ? 
But I 've forgotten . 
Any way , I 'll have me thirty separate , Turk 's - headed life-lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin . 
Then , if the hull go down , there 'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun ! 
Come hammer , caulking-iron , pitch-pot , and marling-spike ! 
Let 's to it . '' 
The Deck The coffin laid upon two line-tubs , between the vice-bench and the open hatchway ; the Carpenter caulking its seams ; the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock . 
-- Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway , and hears Pip following him . 
Back lad ; I will be with ye again presently . 
He goes !
