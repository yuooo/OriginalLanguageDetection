`` But no bones broken , sir , I hope , '' said Stubb with true concern . 
`` Aye ! 
and all splintered to pieces , Stubb ! 
-- d'ye see it . 
-- But even with a broken bone , old Ahab is untouched ; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that 's lost . 
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being . 
Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ? 
-- Aloft there ! 
which way ? '' 
`` Dead to leeward , sir . ''
