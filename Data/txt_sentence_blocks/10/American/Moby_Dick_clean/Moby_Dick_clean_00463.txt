Stubb 's Supper Stubb 's whale had been killed some distance from the ship . 
It was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod . 
And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved . 
For , upon the great canal of Hang-Ho , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with piglead in bulk . 
Darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod 's main-rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks . 
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning . 
Though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object . 
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod 's decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port-holes . 
But by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored . 
Tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel 's , and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing .
