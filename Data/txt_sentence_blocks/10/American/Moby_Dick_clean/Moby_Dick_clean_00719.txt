How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood . 
No . 
Only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out . 
But the spine . 
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end . 
No speedy enterprise . 
But now it 's done , it looks much like Pompey 's Pillar . 
There are forty and odd vertebrae in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together . 
They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry . 
The largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
