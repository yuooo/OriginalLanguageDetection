`` Up dere , '' said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly . 
`` So , then , you expect to go up into our main-top , do you , cook , when you are dead ? 
But do n't you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ? 
Main-top , eh ? '' 
`` Did n't say dat t ` all , '' said Fleece , again in the sulks . 
`` You said up there , did n't you ? 
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . 
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber 's hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you do n't get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging . 
It 's a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it 's no go . 
But none of us are in heaven yet .
