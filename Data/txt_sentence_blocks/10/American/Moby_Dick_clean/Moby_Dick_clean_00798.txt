`` Look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale ! 
Hand me those mainmast links there ; I would fain feel this pulse , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire ! 
So . '' 
Then turning -- the last link held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the Parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and high-flung right arm , he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames . 
`` Oh ! 
thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the sacramental act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is defiance . 
To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and e ` en for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed . 
No fearless fool now fronts thee . 
I own thy speechless , placeless power ; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional , unintegral mastery in me . 
In the midst of the personified impersonal , a personality stands here .
