I concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure . 
And what is it , thought I , after all ! 
It 's only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin . 
But then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , I mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing . 
To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but I never heard of a hot sun 's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one . 
However , I had never been in the South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin . 
Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all . 
But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on . 
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag . 
He now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .
