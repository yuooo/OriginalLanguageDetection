Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal '' -LRB- sperm whale -RRB- , says Surgeon Beale , A.D. 1839 . 
`` Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters . '' 
`` Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea . '' 
`` A field strewn with thorns . '' 
`` All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists . '' 
Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy . 
Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales . 
Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale . 
Run over a few : -- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J. Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev. T. Cheever . 
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show .
