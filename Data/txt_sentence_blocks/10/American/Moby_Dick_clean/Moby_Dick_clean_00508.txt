But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ? 
It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster 's back for the special purpose referred to . 
But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded . 
The whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon . 
So down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him . 
On the occasion in question , Queequeg figured in the Highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen . 
Being the savage 's bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat -LRB- the second one from forward -RRB- , it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale 's back . 
You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord . 
Just so , from the ship 's steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist . 
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us .
