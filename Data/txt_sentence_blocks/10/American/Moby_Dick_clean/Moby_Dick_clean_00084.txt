But , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving . 
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , I conclude that , like the dyspeptic old woman , he must have `` broken his digester . '' 
As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings . 
I felt a melting in me . 
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world . 
This soothing savage had redeemed it . 
There he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits . 
Wild he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him . 
And those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me . 
I 'll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy .
