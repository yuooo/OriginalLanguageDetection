They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered . 
No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale 's mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round . 
One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice-island . 
The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously . 
I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest . 
This man interested me at once ; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate -LRB- though but a sleeping partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned -RRB- , I will here venture upon a little description of him . 
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer-dam . 
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man . 
His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy . 
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature , I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia .
