The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! 
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . 
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . 
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . 
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life-preservers . 
So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . 
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . 
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . 
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . 
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat .
