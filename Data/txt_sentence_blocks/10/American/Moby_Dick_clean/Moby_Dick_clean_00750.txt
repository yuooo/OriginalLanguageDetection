`` I was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir . '' 
`` And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all . 
Begone ! 
Let it leak ! 
I 'm all aleak myself . 
Aye ! 
leaks in leaks ! 
not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that 's a far worse plight than the Pequod 's , man . 
Yet I do n't stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life 's howling gale ? 
Starbuck !
