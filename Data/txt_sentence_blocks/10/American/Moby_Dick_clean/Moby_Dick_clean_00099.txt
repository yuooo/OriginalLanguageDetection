him bevy small-e fish-e ; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e ; Queequeg kill-e big whale ! '' 
`` Look you , '' roared the Captain , `` I 'll kill-e you , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye . '' 
But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye . 
The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck . 
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness . 
It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters . 
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed toward the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale . 
In the midst of this consternation , Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe . 
The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap . 
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam .
