who can tell it ? 
Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides . 
But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ? 
No ; he did not mean to , at least . 
Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies . 
But it so happened , that those boats , without seeing Pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and Stubb 's boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that Pip 's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably . 
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was . 
The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul . 
Not drowned entirely , though . 
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser-merman , Wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever-juvenile eternities , Pip saw the multitudinous , God-omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs .
