`` Work that over again , Perth . '' 
This done , Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron . 
As , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil . 
But , as Ahab looked up , he slid aside . 
`` What 's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for ? '' 
muttered Stubb , looking on from the forecastle . 
`` That Parsee smells fire like a fusee ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket 's powder-pan . '' 
At last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab 's bent face . 
`` Would ` st thou brand me , Perth ? '' 
wincing for a moment with the pain ; `` have I been but forging my own branding-iron , then ? ''
