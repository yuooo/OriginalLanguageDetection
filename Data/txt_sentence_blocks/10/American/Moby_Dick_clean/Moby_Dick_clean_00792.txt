cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , `` markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ? 
the very course he swung to this day noon ? 
now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ? 
In the stern-sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand-point is stove , man ! 
Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must ! 
`` I do n't half understand ye : what 's in the wind ? '' 
`` Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket , '' soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , heedless of Stubb 's question . 
`` The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
