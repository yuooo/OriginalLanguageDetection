Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere . 
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence . 
And not only that , but they looked embarrassed . 
Yes , here were a set of sea-dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains . 
A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen ! 
But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle . 
To be sure I can not say much for his breeding . 
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him . 
But that was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people 's estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly . 
We will not speak of all Queequeg 's peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .
