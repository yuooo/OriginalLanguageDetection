`` Sir ? '' 
`` For the third time my soul 's ship starts upon this voyage , Starbuck . '' 
`` Aye , sir , thou wilt have it so . '' 
`` Some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , Starbuck ! '' 
`` Truth , sir : saddest truth . '' 
`` Some men die at ebb tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ; -- and I feel now like a billow that 's all one crested comb , Starbuck . 
I am old ; -- shake hands with me , man . '' 
Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck 's tears the glue . 
`` Oh , my captain , my captain !
