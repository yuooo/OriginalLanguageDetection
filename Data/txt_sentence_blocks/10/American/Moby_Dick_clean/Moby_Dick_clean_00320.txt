Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea . 
At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship 's time and place ; and then letting it escape . 
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim ! 
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk-white charger , large-eyed , small-headed , bluff-chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . 
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies . 
At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light . 
The flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him . 
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god , bluff-bowed and fearless as this mighty steed . 
Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe . 
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror .
