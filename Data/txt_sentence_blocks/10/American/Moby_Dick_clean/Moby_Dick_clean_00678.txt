Halloa ! 
here 's signs and wonders truly ! 
That , now , is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanack below calls ditto . 
I 'll get the almanack ; and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll 's arithmetic , I 'll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar . 
Here 's the book . 
Let 's see now . 
Signs and wonders ; and the sun , he 's always among 'em . 
Hem , hem , hem ; here they are -- here they go -- all alive : Aries , or the Ram ; Taurus , or the Bull and Jimimi ! 
here 's Gemini himself , or the Twins . 
Well ; the sun he wheels among 'em .
