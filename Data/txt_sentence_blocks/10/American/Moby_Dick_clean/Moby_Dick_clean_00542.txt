As in decapitating the whale , the operator 's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents . 
It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . 
Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale 's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped . 
Cistern and Buckets Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun . 
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single-sheaved block . 
Securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard-arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on the deck . 
Then , hand-over-hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head . 
There -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . 
A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun . 
In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure-hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in .
