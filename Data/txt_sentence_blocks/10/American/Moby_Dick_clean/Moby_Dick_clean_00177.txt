It was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor . 
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from the bows . 
Lank Bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the cordage rang , his steady notes were heard , -- `` Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living green . 
So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between . '' 
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then . 
They were full of hope and fruition . 
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer . 
At last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer . 
The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside . 
It was curious and not unpleasing , how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture , especially Captain Bildad .
