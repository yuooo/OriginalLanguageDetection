Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ? 
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods ! 
go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ? 
Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas . 
Yet Dives himself , he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans . 
But no more of this blubbering now , we are going a-whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come . 
Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this `` Spouter '' may be . 
The Spouter-Inn Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft . 
On one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose . 
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the New England hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched .
