`` At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused . 
Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the Captain returned to the quarter-deck . 
Twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to . 
The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion . 
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged . 
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them . 
Only three were left . '' 
` Better turn to , now ? ' 
said the Captain with a heartless jeer . '' 
` Shut us up again , will ye ! '
