`` No , no , no ; I was n't aware of that , '' said Elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances . 
`` Elijah , '' said I , `` you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing . 
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans , and would prefer not to be detained . '' 
`` Ye be , be ye ? 
Coming back afore breakfast ? '' 
`` He 's cracked , Queequeg , '' said I , `` come on . '' 
`` Holloa ! '' 
cried stationary Elijah , hailing us when we had removed a few paces . 
`` Never mind him , '' said I , `` Queequeg , come on . '' 
But he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said -- `` Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ? ''
