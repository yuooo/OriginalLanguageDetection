When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea . 
In a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favorite with them , they raised a cry of `` Bulkington ! 
Bulkington ! 
where 's Bulkington ? '' 
and darted out of the house in pursuit of him . 
It was now about nine o'clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen . 
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed . 
In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother . 
I do n't know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping . 
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply .
