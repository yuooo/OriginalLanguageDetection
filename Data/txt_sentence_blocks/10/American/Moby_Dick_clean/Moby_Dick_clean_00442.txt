Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews . 
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . 
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . 
No mercy , no power but its own controls it . 
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe . 
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure . 
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks . 
Consider once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began . 
Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ? 
For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life .
