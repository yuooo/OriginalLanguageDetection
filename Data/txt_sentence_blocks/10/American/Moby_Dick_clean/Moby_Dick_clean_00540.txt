For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth . 
But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ? 
What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess 's veil at Lais ? 
The Great Heidelburgh Tun Now comes the Baling of the Case . 
But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon . 
Regarding the Sperm Whale 's head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins , * whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale . 
At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance . 
* Quoin is not a Euclidean term . 
It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics . 
I know not that it has been defined before .
