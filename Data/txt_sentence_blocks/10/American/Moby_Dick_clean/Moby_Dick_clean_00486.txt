Into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows . 
Whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging , slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket-piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering . 
The heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room . 
Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents . 
And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber-room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction . 
The Blanket I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale . 
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore . 
My original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion . 
The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale . 
Already you know what his blubber is .
