Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat 's crew , and pulled off for the stranger . 
Drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste , the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color . 
Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read `` Bouton de Rose , '' -- Rose-button , or Rose-bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship . 
Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription , yet the word rose , and the bulbous figure-head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him . 
`` A wooden rose-bud , eh ? '' 
he cried with his hand to his nose , `` that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells ! '' 
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it . 
Arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled -- `` Bouton-de-Rose , ahoy ! 
are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English ? '' 
`` Yes , '' rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief-mate .
