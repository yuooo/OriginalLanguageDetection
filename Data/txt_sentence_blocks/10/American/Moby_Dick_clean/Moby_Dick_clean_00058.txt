Entering , I found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ' wives and widows . 
A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm . 
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable . 
The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit . 
Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to quote : SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT , Who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard Near the Isle of Desolation , off Patagonia , November 1st , 1836 . 
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER . 
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG , WILLIS ELLERY , NATHAN COLEMAN , WALTER CANNY , SETH MACY , AND SAMUEL GLEIG , Forming one of the boats ' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC , December 31st , 1839 . 
THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES . 
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY , Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan , August 3d , 1833 . 
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW .
