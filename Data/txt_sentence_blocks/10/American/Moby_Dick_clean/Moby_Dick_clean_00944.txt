My God , stand by me now ! '' 
`` Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , sticks here . 
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! 
Who ever helped Stubb , or kept Stubb awake , but Stubb 's own unwinking eye ? 
And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with brushwood ! 
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! 
Look ye , sun , moon , and stars ! 
I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost . 
For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup ! 
Oh , oh !
