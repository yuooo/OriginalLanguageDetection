Do n't I always say that to be good , a whale-steak must be tough ? 
There are those sharks now over the side , do n't you see they prefer it tough and rare ? 
What a shindy they are kicking up ! 
Cook , go and talk to 'em ; tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet . 
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice . 
Away , cook , and deliver my message . 
Here , take this lantern , '' snatching one from his sideboard ; `` now then , go and preach to them ! '' 
Sullenly taking the offered lantern , old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand drooping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said . 
`` Fellow-critters : I ` se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare . 
You hear ?
