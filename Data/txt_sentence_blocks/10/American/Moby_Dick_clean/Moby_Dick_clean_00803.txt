Petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke : -- `` All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound . 
And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats : look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear ! ''
