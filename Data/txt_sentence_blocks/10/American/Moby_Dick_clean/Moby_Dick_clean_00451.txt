So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman . 
The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all . 
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life . 
And lo ! 
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun 's rays like a mirror . 
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . 
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . 
As if struck by some enchanter 's wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . 
`` Clear away the boats ! 
Luff ! ''
