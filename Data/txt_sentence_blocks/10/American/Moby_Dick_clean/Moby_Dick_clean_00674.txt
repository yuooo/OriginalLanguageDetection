Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it last . 
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale 's talisman . 
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it . 
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces . 
Here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun 's disks and stars , ecliptics , horns-of-plenty , and rich banners waving , are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by passing through those fancy mints , so Spanishly poetic . 
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things . 
On its round border it bore the letters , REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR : QUITO . 
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn . 
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra . 
Before this equatorial coin , Ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing .
