Now , amid the green , life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler ! 
Yet , as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him , the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the vines ; every month assuming greener , fresher verdure ; but himself a skeleton . 
Life folded Death ; Death trellised Life ; the grim god wived with youthful Life , and begat him curly-headed glories . 
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu . 
He laughed . 
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine . 
To and fro I paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of Arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbors . 
But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered . 
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones . 
Cutting me a green measuring-rod , I once more dived within the skeleton .
