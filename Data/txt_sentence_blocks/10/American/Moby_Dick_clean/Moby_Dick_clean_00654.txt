Such a clearer ! 
such a sweetener ! 
such a softener ; such a delicious mollifier ! 
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like eels , and began , as it were , to serpentine and spiralize . 
As I sat there at my ease , cross-legged on the deck ; after the bitter exertion at the windlass ; under a blue tranquil sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so serenely along ; as I bathed my hands among those soft , gentle globules of infiltrated tissues , woven almost within the hour ; as they richly broke to my fingers , and discharged all their opulence , like fully ripe grapes their wine ; as . 
I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma , -- literally and truly , like the smell of spring violets ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow ; I forgot all about our horrible oath ; in that inexpressible sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger ; while bathing in that bath , I felt divinely free from all ill-will , or petulance , or malice , of any sort whatsoever . 
Squeeze ! 
squeeze ! 
squeeze ! 
all the morning long ; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers ' hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules .
