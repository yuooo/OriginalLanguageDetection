ha ! 
old Ahab ! 
the White Whale ; he 'll nail ye ! 
This is a pine tree . 
My father , in old Tolland county , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old darkey 's wedding ring . 
How did it get there ? 
And so they 'll say in the resurrection , when they come to fish up this old mast , and find a doubloon lodged in it , with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark . 
Oh , the gold ! 
the precious , precious gold ! 
-- the green miser 'll hoard ye soon !
