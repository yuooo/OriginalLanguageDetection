`` Oh ! 
never thee mind about that , Bildad , '' said Peleg . 
`` Has he ever whaled it any ? '' 
turning to me . 
`` Killed more whales than I can count , Captain Peleg . '' 
`` Well , bring him along then . '' 
And , after signing the papers , off I went ; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning 's work , and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape . 
But I had not proceeded far , when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me ; though , indeed , in many cases , a whale-ship will be completely fitted out , and receive all her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea . 
However , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands . 
Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg , inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found .
