After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together . 
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . 
I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets . 
I let them stay . 
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper firebrand . 
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise . 
I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church . 
How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ? 
But what is worship ? 
thought I. Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ?
