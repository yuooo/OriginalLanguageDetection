oh , oh ! 
thou grinning whale , but there 'll be plenty of gulping soon ! 
Why fly ye not , O Ahab ! 
For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers ! 
A most mouldy and over salted death , though ; -- cherries ! 
cherries ! 
cherries ! 
Oh , Flask , for one red cherry ere we die ! '' 
`` Cherries ? 
I only wish that we were where they grow .
