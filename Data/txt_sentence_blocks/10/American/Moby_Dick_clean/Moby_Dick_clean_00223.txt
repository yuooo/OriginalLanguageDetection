good people all , -- the Greenland whale is deposed , -- the great sperm whale now reigneth ! 
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt . 
Those books are Beale 's and Bennett 's ; both in their time surgeons to the English South-Sea whale-ships , and both exact and reliable men . 
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description . 
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature . 
Far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life . 
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all-outward its departments by subsequent laborers . 
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors . 
I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty . 
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this space at least -- to much of any description .
