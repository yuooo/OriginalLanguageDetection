But if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper . 
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name , Pip by abbreviation . 
Poor Pip ! 
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy-jolly . 
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough-Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar color , driven in one eccentric span . 
But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , Pip , though over tender-hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race . 
For blacks , the year 's calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year 's Days . 
Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king 's cabinets . 
But Pip loved life , and all life 's peaceable securities ; so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler 's frolic on the green ; and at melodious even-tide , with his gay ha-ha ! 
had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine .
