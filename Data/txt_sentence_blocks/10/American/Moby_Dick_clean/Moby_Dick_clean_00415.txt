said a shipmate . '' 
` What do you think ? 
what does it look like ? ' '' 
` Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it 's an odd one , seems to me . ' 
` Yes , rather oddish , ' said the Lakeman , holding it at arm 's length before him ; ` but I think it will answer . 
Shipmate , I have n't enough twine , -- have you any ? ' 
`` But there was none in the forecastle . '' 
` Then I must get some from old Rad ; ' and he rose to go aft . '' 
` You do n't mean to go a begging to him ! '
