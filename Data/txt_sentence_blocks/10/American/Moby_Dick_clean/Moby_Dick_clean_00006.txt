Why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ? 
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy ? 
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of Jove ? 
Surely all this is not without meaning . 
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned . 
But that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans . 
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all . 
Now , when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger . 
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it . 
Besides , passengers get sea-sick -- grow quarrelsome -- do n't sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ; -- no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .
