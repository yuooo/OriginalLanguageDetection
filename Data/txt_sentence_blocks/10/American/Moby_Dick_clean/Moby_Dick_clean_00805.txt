The wind rises , but it has not got up to my table-lands yet . 
Quick , and see to it . 
-- By masts and keels ! 
he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some coasting smack . 
Send down my main-top-sail yard ! 
Ho , gluepots ! 
Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds , and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud . 
Shall I strike that ? 
Oh , none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time . 
What a hooroosh aloft there !
