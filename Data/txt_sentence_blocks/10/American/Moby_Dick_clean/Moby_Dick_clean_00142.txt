Queequeg 's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within . 
`` Have to burst it open , '' said I , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again vowing I should not break down her premises ; but I tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark . 
With a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the knob slamming against the wall , sent the plaster to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens ! 
there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and self-collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head . 
He looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , going up to him , `` Queequeg , what 's the matter with you ? '' 
`` He hai n't been a sittin ' so all day , has he ? '' 
said the landlady . 
But all we said , not a word could we drag out of him ; I almost felt like pushing him over , so as to change his position , for it was almost intolerable , it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially , as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours , going too without his regular meals . 
`` Mrs. Hussey , '' said I , `` he 's alive at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and I will see to this strange affair myself . ''
