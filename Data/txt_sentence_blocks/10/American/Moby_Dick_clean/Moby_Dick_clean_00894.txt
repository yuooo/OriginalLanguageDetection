But struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a towering crest , he shouted , -- `` Sail on the whale ! 
-- Drive him off ! '' 
The Pequod 's prows were pointed - , and breaking up the charmed circle , she effectually parted the white whale from his victim . 
As he sullenly swam off , the boats flew to the rescue . 
Dragged into Stubb 's boat with blood-shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of Ahab 's bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body 's doom for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb 's boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants . 
Far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines . 
But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it . 
In an instant 's compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men 's whole lives . 
And so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls . 
`` The harpoon , '' said Ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm -- `` is it safe ? ''
