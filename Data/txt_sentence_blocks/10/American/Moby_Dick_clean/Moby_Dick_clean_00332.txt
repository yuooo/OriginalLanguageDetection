Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . 
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod 's sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . 
Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race . 
So that Monsoons , Pampas , Nor-Westers , Harmattans , Trades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon , might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod 's circumnavigating wake . 
But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ? 
Yes . 
For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow-white hump , could not but be unmistakable . 
And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ? 
His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep 's ear ! 
And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him !
