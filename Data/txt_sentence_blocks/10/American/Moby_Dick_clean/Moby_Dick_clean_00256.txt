Look ye ! 
d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ? '' 
-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun -- `` it is a sixteen dollar piece , men . 
D'ye see it ? 
Mr. Starbuck , hand me yon top-maul . '' 
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him . 
Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : `` Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys ! '' 
`` Huzza ! 
huzza ! '' 
cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast .
