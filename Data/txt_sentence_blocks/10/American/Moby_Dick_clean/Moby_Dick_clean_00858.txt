There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too curing to my malady . 
Like cures like ; and for this hunt , my malady becomes my most desired health . 
Do thou abide below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou wert the captain . 
Aye , lad , thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair ; another screw to it , thou must be . '' 
`` No , no , no ! 
ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only tread upon me , sir ; I ask no more , so I remain a part of ye . '' 
`` Oh ! 
spite of million villains , this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man ! 
-- and a black ! 
and crazy !
