jump , my jollies ! 
-LRB- They scatter . -RRB- 
PIP -LRB- Shrinking under the windlass -RRB- Jollies ? 
Lord help such jollies ! 
Crish , crash ! 
there goes the jib-stay ! 
Blang-whang ! 
God ! 
Duck lower , Pip , here comes the royal yard ! 
It 's worse than being in the whirled woods , the last day of the year !
