`` Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings . '' 
` Aye , aye , my merry lads , it 's a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let 's have a taste . 
By the Lord , it 's worth bottling ! 
I tell ye what , men , old Rad 's investment must go for it ! 
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home . 
The fact is , boys , that sword-fish only began the job ; he 's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters , saw-fish , and file-fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose . 
If old Rad were here now , I 'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em . 
They 're playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him . 
But he 's a simple old soul , -- Rad , and a beauty too . 
Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses .
