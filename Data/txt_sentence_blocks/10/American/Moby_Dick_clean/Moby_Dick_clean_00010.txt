But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else . 
And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago . 
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances . 
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this : `` Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States . 
`` WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL . '' 
`` BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN . '' 
Though I can not tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the Fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though I can not tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment . 
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself . 
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity . 
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .
