From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches . 
In general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length . 
The middle ribs were the most arched . 
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams . 
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form . 
The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth . 
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet . 
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part . 
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels . 
Still more , for the ample fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !
