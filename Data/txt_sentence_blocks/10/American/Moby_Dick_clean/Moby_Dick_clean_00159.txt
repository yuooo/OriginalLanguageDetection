`` My friend , '' said I , `` what all this gibberish of yours is about , I do n't know , and I do n't much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head . 
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg . '' 
`` All about it , eh -- sure you do ? 
all ? 
`` Pretty sure . '' 
With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the beggar-like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said : -- `` Ye 've shipped , have ye ? 
Names down on the papers ? 
Well , well , what 's signed , is signed ; and what 's to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it wo n't be , after all . 
Any how , it 's all fixed and arranged a ` ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity 'em ! 
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I 'm sorry I stopped ye . ''
