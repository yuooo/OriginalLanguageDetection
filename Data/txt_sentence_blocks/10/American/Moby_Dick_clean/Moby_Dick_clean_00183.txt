Butchers we are , that is true . 
But butchers , also , and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor . 
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business , ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth . 
But even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies ' plaudits ? 
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier 's profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale 's vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head . 
For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God ! 
But , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all-abounding adoration ! 
for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory ! 
But look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been . 
Why did the Dutch in De Witt 's time have admirals of their whaling fleets ?
