Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft . 
`` Sir ! '' 
said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case . 
`` Send everybody aft , '' repeated Ahab . 
`` Mast-heads , there ! 
come down ! '' 
When the entire ship 's company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck . 
With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat . 
But this did not last long . 
Vehemently pausing , he cried : -- `` What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ? ''
