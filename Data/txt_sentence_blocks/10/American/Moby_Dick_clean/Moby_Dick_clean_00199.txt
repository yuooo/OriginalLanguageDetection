Tashtego was Stubb the second mate 's squire . 
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal-black negro-savage , with a lion-like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold . 
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ringbolts , and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them . 
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast . 
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks . 
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress . 
Curious to tell , this imperial negro , Ahasuerus Daggoo , was the Squire of little Flask , who looked like a chess-man beside him . 
As for the residue of the Pequod 's company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are Americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are . 
Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies , and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads . 
The same , I say , because in all these cases the native American literally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles .
