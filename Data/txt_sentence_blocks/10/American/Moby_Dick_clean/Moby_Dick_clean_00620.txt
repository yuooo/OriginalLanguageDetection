The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools . 
Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard . 
They soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three-fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems . 
Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes . 
Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull -- poor devil ! 
all his comrades quit him . 
But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey . 
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish The allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge . 
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies , all partaking of this one grand feature . 
For example , -- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line .
