`` There 's a pretty fellow , now , '' he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship 's bows , `` there 's a jackal for ye ! 
I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get wo n't be enough to dip the Captain 's wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here 's a Crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there . 
Poor devil ! 
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let 's make him a present of a little oil for dear charity 's sake . 
For what oil he 'll get from that drugged whale there , would n't be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell . 
And as for the other whale , why , I 'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he 'll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris . 
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that . 
It 's worth trying . 
Yes , I 'm for it ; '' and so saying he started for the quarter-deck . 
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again .
