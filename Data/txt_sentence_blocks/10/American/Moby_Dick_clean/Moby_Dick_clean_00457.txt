* Partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose . 
Your hat , however , is the most convenient . 
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once . 
A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea . 
Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity . 
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight . 
`` Haul in -- haul in ! '' 
cried Stubb to the bowsman ! 
and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on . 
Soon ranging up by his flank , Stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale 's horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling .
