Oh , Stubb , I hope my poor mother 's drawn my part-pay ere this ; if not , few coppers will now come to her , for the voyage is up . '' 
From the ship 's bows , nearly all the seamen now hung inactive ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various employments ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head , sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed . 
Retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship 's starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled . 
Some fell flat upon their faces . 
Like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks . 
Through the breach , they heard the waters pour , as mountain torrents down a flume . 
`` The ship ! 
The hearse ! 
-- the second hearse ! '' 
cried Ahab from the boat ; `` its wood could only be American ! ''
