* * A little item may as well be related here . 
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other -LRB- excepting the side-fins -RRB- , its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it . 
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship . 
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes . 
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement . 
Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs . 
One small , helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb , was soon made strangely manifest . 
Stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate . 
`` A steak , a steak , ere I sleep ! 
You , Daggoo !
