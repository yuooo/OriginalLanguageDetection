`` The Duke . '' 
`` But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke 's benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ? ''
