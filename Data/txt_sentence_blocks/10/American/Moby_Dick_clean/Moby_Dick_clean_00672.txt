They know not the thing you distantly allude to . 
Away , and bring us napkins ! 
But mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on spying out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere . 
Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line , -- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of `` There she blows ! '' 
and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again . 
Oh ! 
my friends , but this is man-killing ! 
Yet this is life . 
For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world 's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when -- There she blows ! 
-- the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life 's old routine again .
