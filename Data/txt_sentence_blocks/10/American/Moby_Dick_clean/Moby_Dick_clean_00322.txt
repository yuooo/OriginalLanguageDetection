It can not well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here . 
And from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them . 
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog -- Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse . 
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul . 
But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ? 
To analyse it , would seem impossible . 
Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ; -- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ? 
Let us try . 
But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls . 
And though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now .
