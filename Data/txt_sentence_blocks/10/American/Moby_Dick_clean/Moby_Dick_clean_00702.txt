`` Good God ! ''

`` What 's the matter ? 
He was heading east , I think . 
-- Is your Captain crazy ? '' 
whispering Fedallah . 
But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat 's steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the cutting-tackle towards him commanded the ship 's sailors to stand by to lower . 
In a moment he was standing in the boat 's stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars . 
In vain the English Captain hailed him .
