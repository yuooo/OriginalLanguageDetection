I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair-and-square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler 's job , that 's at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end . 
It 's the old woman 's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs . 
Lord ! 
what an affection all old women have for tinkers . 
I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once . 
And that 's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me . 
But heigh-ho ! 
there are no caps at sea but snow-caps . 
Let me see . 
Nail down the lid ; caulk the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; batten them down tight , and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship 's stern .
