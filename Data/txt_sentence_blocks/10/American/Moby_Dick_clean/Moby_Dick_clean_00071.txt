Jonah , that 's another stab . 
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent . 
` I 'll sail with ye , ' -- he says , -- ` the passage money how much is that ? 
-- I 'll pay now . ' 
For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ` that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail . 
And taken with the context , this is full of meaning . 
`` Now Jonah 's Captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless . 
In this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport ; whereas Virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers . 
So Jonah 's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah 's purse , ere he judge him openly . 
He charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it 's assented to .
