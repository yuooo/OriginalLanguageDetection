My soul is more than matched ; she 's over-manned ; and by a madman ! 
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field ! 
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me ! 
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it . 
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut . 
Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it .
