Crushed thirty feet upwards , the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains , then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes , leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale . 
`` Give way ! '' 
cried Ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday 's fresh irons that corroded in him , Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven . 
The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked knitted together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more flailed them apart ; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates ' boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving Ahab 's almost without a scar . 
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up . 
Lashed round and round to the fish 's back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab . 
The harpoon dropped from his hand . 
`` Befooled , befooled ! '' 
-- drawing in a long lean breath -- `` Aye , Parsee ! 
I see thee again .
