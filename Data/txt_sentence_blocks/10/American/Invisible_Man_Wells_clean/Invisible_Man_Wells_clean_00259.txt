There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked . 
But I stuck to it ... . 
I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness . 
`` The pain had passed . 
I thought I was killing myself and I did not care . 
I shall never forget that dawn , and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass , and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by , until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through them , though I closed my transparent eyelids . 
My limbs became glassy , the bones and arteries faded , vanished , and the little white nerves went last . 
I gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end . 
At last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained , pallid and white , and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers . 
`` I struggled up .
