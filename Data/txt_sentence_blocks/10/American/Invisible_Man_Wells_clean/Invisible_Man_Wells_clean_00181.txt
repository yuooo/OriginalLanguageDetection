The bearded man 's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down . 
As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel , curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen . 
The door flew open while the barman hesitated , and Marvel was dragged into the kitchen . 
There was a scream and a clatter of pans . 
Marvel , head down , and lugging back obstinately , was forced to the kitchen door , and the bolts were drawn . 
Then the policeman , who had been trying to pass the barman , rushed in , followed by one of the cabmen , gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared Marvel , was hit in the face and went reeling back . 
The door opened , and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it . 
Then the cabman collared something . 
`` I got him , '' said the cabman . 
The barman 's red hands came clawing at the unseen .
