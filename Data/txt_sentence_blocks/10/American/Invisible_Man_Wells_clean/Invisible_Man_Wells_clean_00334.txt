It was a fortunate thing , perhaps , for humanity , but for him it was a fatal inaction . 
During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were busy . 
In the morning he had still been simply a legend , a terror ; in the afternoon , by virtue chiefly of Kemp 's drily worded proclamation , he was presented as a tangible antagonist , to be wounded , captured , or overcome , and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity . 
By two o'clock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train , but after two that became impossible . 
Every passenger train along the lines on a great parallelogram between Southampton , Manchester , Brighton and Horsham , travelled with locked doors , and the goods traffic was almost entirely suspended . 
And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port Burdock , men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups of three and four , with dogs , to beat the roads and fields . 
Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes , stopping at every cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses , and keep indoors unless they were armed , and all the elementary schools had broken up by three o'clock , and the children , scared and keeping together in groups , were hurrying home . 
Kemp 's proclamation -- signed indeed by Adye -- was posted over almost the whole district by four or five o'clock in the afternoon . 
It gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle , the necessity of keeping the Invisible Man from food and sleep , the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements . 
And so swift and decided was the action of the authorities , so prompt and universal was the belief in this strange being , that before nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege .
