After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed , he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland . 
There is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom . 
It was wailing and laughing , sobbing and groaning , and ever and again it shouted . 
It must have been queer hearing . 
It drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills . 
That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences . 
He must have found houses locked and secured ; he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns , and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him . 
And as the evening advanced , the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men , and noisy with the yelping of dogs . 
These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another . 
But he avoided them all .
