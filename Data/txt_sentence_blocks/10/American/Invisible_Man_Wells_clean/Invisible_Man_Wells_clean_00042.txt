Sussex folk have few superstitions , and it was only after the events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village . 
Even then it was only credited among the women folk . 
But whatever they thought of him , people in Iping , on the whole , agreed in disliking him . 
His irritability , though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker , was an amazing thing to these quiet Sussex villagers . 
The frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then , the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners , the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity , the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors , the pulling down of blinds , the extinction of candles and lamps -- who could agree with such goings on ? 
They drew aside as he passed down the village , and when he had gone by , young humourists would up with coat-collars and down with hat-brims , and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing . 
There was a song popular at that time called `` The Bogey Man '' . 
Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert -LRB- in aid of the church lamps -RRB- , and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared , a bar or so of this tune , more or less sharp or flat , was whistled in the midst of them . 
Also belated little children would call `` Bogey Man ! '' 
after him , and make off tremulously elated .
