Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom , and then I made a deliberate selection . 
I found a handbag I thought a suitable possession , and some powder , rouge , and sticking-plaster . 
`` I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me , in order to render myself visible , but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again . 
Finally I chose a mask of the better type , slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings , dark glasses , greyish whiskers , and a wig . 
I could find no underclothing , but that I could buy subsequently , and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs . 
I could find no socks , but the hunchback 's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed . 
In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings ' worth of silver , and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold . 
I could go forth into the world again , equipped . 
`` Then came a curious hesitation . 
Was my appearance really credible ?
