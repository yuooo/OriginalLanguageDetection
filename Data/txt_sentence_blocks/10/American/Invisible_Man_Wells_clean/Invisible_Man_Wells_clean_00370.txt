Then he put his feet to the ground , and sat listening . 
He said he was damned , but still the strange thing was visible . 
The house looked as though it had been deserted for weeks -- after a violent riot . 
Every window was broken , and every window , save those of the belvedere study , was blinded by the internal shutters . 
`` I could have sworn it was all right '' -- he looked at his watch -- `` twenty minutes ago . '' 
He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass , far away in the distance . 
And then , as he sat open-mouthed , came a still more wonderful thing . 
The shutters of the drawing-room window were flung open violently , and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments , appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash . 
Suddenly a man appeared beside her , helping her -- Dr. Kemp ! 
In another moment the window was open , and the housemaid was struggling out ; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs .
