The Invisible Man started and stood still . 
`` Traitor ! '' 
cried the Voice , and suddenly the dressing-gown opened , and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe . 
Kemp made three swift steps to the door , and forthwith the Invisible Man -- his legs had vanished -- sprang to his feet with a shout . 
Kemp flung the door open . 
As it opened , there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices . 
With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back , sprang aside , and slammed the door . 
The key was outside and ready . 
In another moment Griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study , a prisoner . 
Save for one little thing .
