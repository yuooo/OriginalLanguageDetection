`` Why not ? '' 
The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp . 
`` Because I 've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men , '' he said slowly . 
Kemp started . 
`` Fool that I am ! '' 
said the Invisible Man , striking the table smartly . 
`` I 've put the idea into your head . '' 
THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was , he refused to accept Kemp 's word that his freedom should be respected . 
He examined the two windows of the bedroom , drew up the blinds and opened the sashes , to confirm Kemp 's statement that a retreat by them would be possible . 
Outside the night was very quiet and still , and the new moon was setting over the down .
