A tram was just arriving at the hill foot . 
Beyond that was the police station . 
Was that footsteps he heard behind him ? 
Spurt . 
The people below were staring at him , one or two were running , and his breath was beginning to saw in his throat . 
The tram was quite near now , and the `` Jolly Cricketers '' was noisily barring its doors . 
Beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel -- the drainage works . 
He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors , and then he resolved to go for the police station . 
In another moment he had passed the door of the `` Jolly Cricketers , '' and was in the blistering fag end of the street , with human beings about him . 
The tram driver and his helper -- arrested by the sight of his furious haste -- stood staring with the tram horses unhitched .
