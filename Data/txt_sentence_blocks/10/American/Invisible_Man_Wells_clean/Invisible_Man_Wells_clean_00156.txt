said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But then , it 's an extra-ordinary story . 
There is a clergyman and a medical gent witnesses -- saw ` im all right and proper -- or leastways did n't see ` im . 
He was staying , it says , at the ` Coach an ' Horses , ' and no one do n't seem to have been aware of his misfortune , it says , aware of his misfortune , until in an Altercation in the inn , it says , his bandages on his head was torn off . 
It was then ob-served that his head was invisible . 
Attempts were At Once made to secure him , but casting off his garments , it says , he succeeded in escaping , but not until after a desperate struggle , in which he had inflicted serious injuries , it says , on our worthy and able constable , Mr. J. A. Jaffers . 
Pretty straight story , eh ? 
Names and everything . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , looking nervously about him , trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch , and full of a strange and novel idea .
