`` As you like . 
In a bit the room will be warmer . '' 
He made no answer , and had turned his face away from her again , and Mrs. Hall , feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed , laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room . 
When she returned he was still standing there , like a man of stone , his back hunched , his collar turned up , his dripping hat-brim turned down , hiding his face and ears completely . 
She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis , and called rather than said to him , `` Your lunch is served , sir . '' 
`` Thank you , '' he said at the same time , and did not stir until she was closing the door . 
Then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness . 
As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals . 
Chirk , chirk , chirk , it went , the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin . 
`` That girl ! ''
