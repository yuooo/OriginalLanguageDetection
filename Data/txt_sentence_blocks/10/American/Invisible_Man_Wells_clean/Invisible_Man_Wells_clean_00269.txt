and it seemed an interminable time to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me . 
Thud , thud , thud , came the drum with a vibrating resonance , and for the moment I did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me . 
` See 'em , ' said one . 
` See what ? ' 
said the other . 
` Why -- them footmarks -- bare . 
Like what you makes in mud . ' 
`` I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps . 
The passing people elbowed and jostled them , but their confounded intelligence was arrested . 
` Thud , thud , thud , when , thud , shall we see , thud , his face , thud , thud . '
