`` Full of extra-ordinary asses , '' he said softly to himself . 
`` Just to take me down a bit -- that was his silly game -- It 's on the paper ! '' 
And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear , that had happened quite close to him . 
And that was a vision of a `` fist full of money '' -LRB- no less -RRB- travelling without visible agency , along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael 's Lane . 
A brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning . 
He had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong , and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished . 
Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything , he declared , but that was a bit too stiff . 
Afterwards , however , he began to think things over . 
The story of the flying money was true .
