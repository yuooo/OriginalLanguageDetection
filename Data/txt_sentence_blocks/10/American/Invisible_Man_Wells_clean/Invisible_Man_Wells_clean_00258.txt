Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry , dropped candle and writ together , and went blundering down the dark passage to the stairs . 
I shut the door , locked it , and went to the looking-glass . 
Then I understood his terror ... . 
My face was white -- like white stone . 
`` But it was all horrible . 
I had not expected the suffering . 
A night of racking anguish , sickness and fainting . 
I set my teeth , though my skin was presently afire , all my body afire ; but I lay there like grim death . 
I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it . 
Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room .
