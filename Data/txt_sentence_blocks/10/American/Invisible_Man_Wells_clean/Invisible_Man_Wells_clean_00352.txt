`` Now for the door , '' said Adye . 
As they stood hesitating in the hall , they heard one of the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash . 
Kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible . 
His face was a little paler than usual . 
`` You must step straight out , '' said Kemp . 
In another moment Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples . 
He hesitated for a moment , feeling more comfortable with his back against the door . 
Then he marched , upright and square , down the steps . 
He crossed the lawn and approached the gate . 
A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass .
