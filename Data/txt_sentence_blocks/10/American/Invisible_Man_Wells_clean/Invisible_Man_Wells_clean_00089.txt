He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limply and empty in his hand . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
said Jaffers , loudly . 
`` Once he gets the things off -- '' `` Hold him ! '' 
cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger . 
The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall 's face that stopped his open-armed advance , and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton , and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms , even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man 's head . 
Jaffers clutched at it , and only helped to pull it off ; he was struck in the mouth out of the air , and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head . 
`` Look out ! ''
