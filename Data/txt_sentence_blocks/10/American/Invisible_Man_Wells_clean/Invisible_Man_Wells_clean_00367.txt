Then he stood , poker clubbed , listening intent for the slightest movement . 
He heard the dining-room window open , and a quick rush of feet within . 
His companion rolled over and sat up , with the blood running down between his eye and ear . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
asked the man on the floor . 
`` Do n't know . 
I 've hit him . 
He 's standing somewhere in the hall . 
Unless he 's slipped past you . 
Doctor Kemp -- sir . ''
