said Adye , sitting up . 
`` Get up , '' said the Voice . 
Adye stood up . 
`` Attention , '' said the Voice , and then fiercely , `` Do n't try any games . 
Remember I can see your face if you ca n't see mine . 
You 've got to go back to the house . '' 
`` He wo n't let me in , '' said Adye . 
`` That 's a pity , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` I 've got no quarrel with you . ''
