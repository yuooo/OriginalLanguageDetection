As he went down , the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner . 
The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , a burly man in a blue jersey . 
He was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground . 
And then something happened to his rear-most foot , and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner , following headlong . 
The two were then kicked , knelt on , fallen over , and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty people . 
Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house , Mrs. Hall , who had been disciplined by years of experience , remained in the bar next the till . 
And suddenly the parlour door was opened , and Mr. Cuss appeared , and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Do n't let him drop that parcel . ''
