He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high , black , linen-lined collar turned up about his neck . 
The thick black hair , escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages , projected in curious tails and horns , giving him the strangest appearance conceivable . 
This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated , that for a moment she was rigid . 
He did not remove the serviette , but remained holding it , as she saw now , with a brown gloved hand , and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses . 
`` Leave the hat , '' he said , speaking very distinctly through the white cloth . 
Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received . 
She placed the hat on the chair again by the fire . 
`` I did n't know , sir , '' she began , `` that -- '' and she stopped embarrassed . 
`` Thank you , '' he said drily , glancing from her to the door and then at her again .
