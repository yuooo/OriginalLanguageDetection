In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , ` All hands to the doors ! ' 
asking what was ` up , ' and giving one another advice how to catch me . 
`` Lying on the ground , I felt scared out of my wits . 
But -- odd as it may seem -- it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I should have done . 
I had made up my mind , I suppose , to get away in them , and that ruled me . 
And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of ` Here he is ! ' 
`` I sprang to my feet , whipped a chair off the counter , and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted , turned , came into another round a corner , sent him spinning , and rushed up the stairs . 
He kept his footing , gave a view hallo , and came up the staircase hot after me . 
Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot things -- what are they ? '' 
`` Art pots , '' suggested Kemp .
