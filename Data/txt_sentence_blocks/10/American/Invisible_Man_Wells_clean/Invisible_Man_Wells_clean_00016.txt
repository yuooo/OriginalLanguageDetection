he said , staring round in a drowsy manner , and speaking over his hand , and then , getting more fully awake , `` certainly . '' 
Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp , and he rose and stretched himself . 
Then came the light , and Mr. Teddy Henfrey , entering , was confronted by this bandaged person . 
He was , he says , `` taken aback . '' 
`` Good afternoon , '' said the stranger , regarding him -- as Mr. Henfrey says , with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles -- `` like a lobster . '' 
`` I hope , '' said Mr. Henfrey , `` that it 's no intrusion . '' 
`` None whatever , '' said the stranger . 
`` Though , I understand , '' he said turning to Mrs. Hall , `` that this room is really to be mine for my own private use . '' 
`` I thought , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` you 'd prefer the clock -- '' `` Certainly , '' said the stranger , `` certainly -- but , as a rule , I like to be alone and undisturbed . 
`` But I 'm really glad to have the clock seen to , '' he said , seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey 's manner .
