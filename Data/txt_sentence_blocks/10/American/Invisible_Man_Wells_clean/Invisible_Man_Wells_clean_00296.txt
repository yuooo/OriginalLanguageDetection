This brought him back , more sinister than ever . 
That time he actually touched me , jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room . 
`` Presently he calmed a little . 
` Rats , ' he said in an undertone , fingers on lips . 
He was evidently a little scared . 
I edged quietly out of the room , but a plank creaked . 
Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house , revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys . 
When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage -- I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity . 
By this time I knew he was alone in the house , and so I made no more ado , but knocked him on the head . '' 
`` Knocked him on the head ? ''
