`` That 's odd ! 
But still I do n't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone , but personal invisibility is a far cry . '' 
`` Precisely , '' said Griffin . 
`` But consider , visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light . 
Either a body absorbs light , or it reflects or refracts it , or does all these things . 
If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light , it can not of itself be visible . 
You see an opaque red box , for instance , because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest , all the red part of the light , to you . 
If it did not absorb any particular part of the light , but reflected it all , then it would be a shining white box . 
Silver ! 
A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface , but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted , so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies -- a sort of skeleton of light .
