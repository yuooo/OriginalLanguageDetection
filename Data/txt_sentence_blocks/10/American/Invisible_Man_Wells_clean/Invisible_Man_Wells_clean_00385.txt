His movements are slow , and he is a great thinker . 
But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village , and his knowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett . 
And on Sunday mornings , every Sunday morning , all the year round , while he is closed to the outer world , and every night after ten , he goes into his bar parlour , bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water , and having placed this down , he locks the door and examines the blinds , and even looks under the table . 
And then , being satisfied of his solitude , he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a drawer in that box , and produces three volumes bound in brown leather , and places them solemnly in the middle of the table . 
The covers are weather-worn and tinged with an algal green -- for once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water . 
The landlord sits down in an armchair , fills a long clay pipe slowly -- gloating over the books the while . 
Then he pulls one towards him and opens it , and begins to study it -- turning over the leaves backwards and forwards . 
His brows are knit and his lips move painfully . 
`` Hex , little two up in the air , cross and a fiddle-de-dee . 
Lord !
