`` Lie still , you fool ! '' 
bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp 's ear . 
Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still . 
`` If you shout , I 'll smash your face , '' said the Invisible Man , relieving his mouth . 
`` I 'm an Invisible Man . 
It 's no foolishness , and no magic . 
I really am an Invisible Man . 
And I want your help . 
I do n't want to hurt you , but if you behave like a frantic rustic , I must . 
Do n't you remember me , Kemp ?
