They refastened the back door , examined the kitchen , pantry , and scullery thoroughly , and at last went down into the cellar . 
There was not a soul to be found in the house , search as they would . 
Daylight found the vicar and his wife , a quaintly-costumed little couple , still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle . 
THE FURNITURE THAT WENT MAD Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday , before Millie was hunted out for the day , Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar . 
Their business there was of a private nature , and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer . 
They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room . 
As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair , Hall very properly went upstairs for it . 
On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger 's door was ajar . 
He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed . 
But returning with the bottle , he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back , that the door was in fact simply on the latch .
