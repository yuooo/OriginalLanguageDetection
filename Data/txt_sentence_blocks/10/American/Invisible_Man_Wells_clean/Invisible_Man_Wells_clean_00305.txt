So I thought . 
Whatever I did , whatever the consequences might be , was nothing to me . 
I had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish . 
No person could hold me . 
I could take my money where I found it . 
I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast , and then put up at a good hotel , and accumulate a new outfit of property . 
I felt amazingly confident ; it 's not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass . 
I went into a place and was already ordering lunch , when it occurred to me that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face . 
I finished ordering the lunch , told the man I should be back in ten minutes , and went out exasperated . 
I do n't know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite . ''
