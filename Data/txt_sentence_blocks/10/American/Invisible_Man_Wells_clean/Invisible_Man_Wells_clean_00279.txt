And near that was a toy department , and I had a brilliant idea . 
I found some artificial noses -- dummy noses , you know , and I thought of dark spectacles . 
But Omniums had no optical department . 
My nose had been a difficulty indeed -- I had thought of paint . 
But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like . 
Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts , very warm and comfortable . 
`` My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had since the change . 
I was in a state of physical serenity , and that was reflected in my mind . 
I thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me , muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken , purchase , with the money I had taken , spectacles and so forth , and so complete my disguise . 
I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days .
