`` All the facts are out about you , '' said Kemp , standing up with the glass in his hand ; `` all that happened in Iping , and down the hill . 
The world has become aware of its invisible citizen . 
But no one knows you are here . '' 
The Invisible Man swore . 
`` The secret 's out . 
I gather it was a secret . 
I do n't know what your plans are , but of course I 'm anxious to help you . '' 
The Invisible Man sat down on the bed . 
`` There 's breakfast upstairs , '' said Kemp , speaking as easily as possible , and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly . 
Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere .
