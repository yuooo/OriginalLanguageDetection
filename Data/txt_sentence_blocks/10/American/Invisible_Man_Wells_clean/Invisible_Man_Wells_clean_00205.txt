`` How did the shooting begin ? '' 
`` There was a real fool of a man -- a sort of confederate of mine -- curse him ! 
-- who tried to steal my money . 
Has done so . '' 
`` Is he invisible too ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Ca n't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that ? 
I 'm hungry -- in pain . 
And you want me to tell stories ! ''
