`` Wait till the summer , '' said Mrs. Hall sagely , `` when the artisks are beginning to come . 
Then we 'll see . 
He may be a bit overbearing , but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual , whatever you 'd like to say . '' 
The stranger did not go to church , and indeed made no difference between Sunday and the irreligious days , even in costume . 
He worked , as Mrs. Hall thought , very fitfully . 
Some days he would come down early and be continuously busy . 
On others he would rise late , pace his room , fretting audibly for hours together , smoke , sleep in the armchair by the fire . 
Communication with the world beyond the village he had none . 
His temper continued very uncertain ; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation , and once or twice things were snapped , torn , crushed , or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence . 
He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity .
