He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn , and his decision was made . 
He clambered out of the window , adjusted his costume hastily , and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him . 
From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr. Bunting made his memorable flight up the village , it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping . 
Possibly the Invisible Man 's original intention was simply to cover Marvel 's retreat with the clothes and books .

You must figure the street full of running figures , of doors slamming and fights for hiding-places . 
You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher 's planks and two chairs -- with cataclysmic results . 
You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing . 
And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen , and littered with cocoanuts , overthrown canvas screens , and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall . 
Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts , and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane .
