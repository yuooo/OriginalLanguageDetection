Cuss , the general practitioner , was devoured by curiosity . 
The bandages excited his professional interest , the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard . 
All through April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger , and at last , towards Whitsuntide , he could stand it no longer , but hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse . 
He was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest 's name . 
`` He give a name , '' said Mrs. Hall -- an assertion which was quite unfounded -- `` but I did n't rightly hear it . '' 
She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man 's name . 
Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered . 
There was a fairly audible imprecation from within . 
`` Pardon my intrusion , '' said Cuss , and then the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation . 
She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes , then a cry of surprise , a stirring of feet , a chair flung aside , a bark of laughter , quick steps to the door , and Cuss appeared , his face white , his eyes staring over his shoulder .
