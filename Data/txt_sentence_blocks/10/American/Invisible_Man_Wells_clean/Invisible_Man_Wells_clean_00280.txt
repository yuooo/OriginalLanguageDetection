I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms ; I saw his two sons marvelling , and the wrinkled old woman 's gnarled face as she asked for her cat . 
I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear , and so I came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling ` Earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust , ' at my father 's open grave . '' 
` You also , ' said a voice , and suddenly I was being forced towards the grave . 
I struggled , shouted , appealed to the mourners , but they continued stonily following the service ; the old clergyman , too , never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual . 
I realised I was invisible and inaudible , that overwhelming forces had their grip on me . 
I struggled in vain , I was forced over the brink , the coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it , and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls . 
Nobody heeded me , nobody was aware of me . 
I made convulsive struggles and awoke . 
`` The pale London dawn had come , the place was full of a chilly grey light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds . 
I sat up , and for a time I could not think where this ample apartment , with its counters , its piles of rolled stuff , its heap of quilts and cushions , its iron pillars , might be .
