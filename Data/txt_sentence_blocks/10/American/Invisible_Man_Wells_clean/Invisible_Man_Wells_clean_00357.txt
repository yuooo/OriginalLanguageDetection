If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door ? '' 
`` I 've got no quarrel with you , '' said the Voice . 
Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out , and now crouching among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill , he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen . 
`` Why does n't he fire ? '' 
whispered Kemp to himself . 
Then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp 's eyes . 
He shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam . 
`` Surely ! '' 
he said , `` Adye has given up the revolver . '' 
`` Promise not to rush the door , '' Adye was saying .
