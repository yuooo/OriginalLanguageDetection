`` You must begin at once . 
You must set every available man to work ; you must prevent his leaving this district . 
Once he gets away , he may go through the countryside as he wills , killing and maiming . 
He dreams of a reign of terror ! 
A reign of terror , I tell you . 
You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping . 
The garrison must help . 
You must wire for help . 
The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value . 
I will tell you of that !
