`` But a fool of a cabman , standing outside a public house , made a sudden rush for this , and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear . 
I let the whole down with a smash on the cabman , and then , with shouts and the clatter of feet about me , people coming out of shops , vehicles pulling up , I realised what I had done for myself , and cursing my folly , backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion . 
In a moment I should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered . 
I pushed by a butcher boy , who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside , and dodged behind the cab-man 's four-wheeler . 
I do not know how they settled the business , I hurried straight across the road , which was happily clear , and hardly heeding which way I went , in the fright of detection the incident had given me , plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street . 
`` I tried to get into the stream of people , but they were too thick for me , and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon . 
I took to the gutter , the roughness of which I found painful to my feet , and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade , reminding me that I was already bruised severely . 
I staggered out of the way of the cab , avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement , and found myself behind the hansom . 
A happy thought saved me , and as this drove slowly along I followed in its immediate wake , trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure . 
And not only trembling , but shivering .
