When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room , Kemp was still pacing up and down , trying to grasp the incredible . 
He was altogether too excited to sleep . 
His servants , descending sleepily , discovered him , and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill on him . 
He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere study -- and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor . 
Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning 's paper came . 
That had much to say and little to tell , beyond the confirmation of the evening before , and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock . 
This gave Kemp the essence of the happenings at the `` Jolly Cricketers , '' and the name of Marvel . 
`` He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours , '' Marvel testified . 
Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story , notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire . 
But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp ; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no information about the three books , or the money with which he was lined .
