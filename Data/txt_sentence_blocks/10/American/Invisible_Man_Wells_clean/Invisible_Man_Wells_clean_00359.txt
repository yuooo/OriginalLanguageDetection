Kemp did not hear the sound of the shot . 
Adye writhed , raised himself on one arm , fell forward , and lay still . 
For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye 's attitude . 
The afternoon was very hot and still , nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate . 
Adye lay on the lawn near the gate . 
The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn , but in one little green summer-house was a white figure , apparently an old man asleep . 
Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver , but it had vanished . 
His eyes came back to Adye . 
The game was opening well . 
Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door , that grew at last tumultuous , but pursuant to Kemp 's instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms .
