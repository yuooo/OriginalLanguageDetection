Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police . 
This idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey . 
No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred . 
Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould , the probationary assistant in the National School , this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise , preparing explosives , and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted . 
These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met , or in asking people who had never seen the stranger , leading questions about him . 
But he detected nothing . 
Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside , and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it ; as , for instance , Silas Durgan , who was heard to assert that `` if he choses to show enself at fairs he 'd make his fortune in no time , '' and being a bit of a theologian , compared the stranger to the man with the one talent . 
Yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic . 
That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away . 
Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers .
