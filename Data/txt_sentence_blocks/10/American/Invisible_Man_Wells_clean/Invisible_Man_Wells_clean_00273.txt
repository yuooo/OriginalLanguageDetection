My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman 's fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . 
I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . 
Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . 
Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . 
I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze . 
And every dog that came in sight , with its pointing nose and curious sniffing , was a terror to me . 
`` Then came men and boys running , first one and then others , and shouting as they ran . 
It was a fire . 
They ran in the direction of my lodging , and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires . 
It was my lodging burning ; my clothes , my apparatus , all my resources indeed , except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street , were there .
