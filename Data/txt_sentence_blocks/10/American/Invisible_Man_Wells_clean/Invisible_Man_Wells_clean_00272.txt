Look ! 
Feet running ! ' 
`` Everybody in the road , except my three pursuers , was pouring along after the Salvation Army , and this blow not only impeded me but them . 
There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation . 
At the cost of bowling over one young fellow I got through , and in another moment I was rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square , with six or seven astonished people following my footmarks . 
There was no time for explanation , or else the whole host would have been after me . 
`` Twice I doubled round corners , thrice I crossed the road and came back upon my tracks , and then , as my feet grew hot and dry , the damp impressions began to fade . 
At last I had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands , and so got away altogether . 
The last I saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps , studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in Tavistock Square , a footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as Crusoe 's solitary discovery . 
`` This running warmed me to a certain extent , and I went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts .
