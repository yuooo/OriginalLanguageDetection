He left the door open behind him , and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps , and she heard his feet hurrying along the road . 
He carried his hat in his hand . 
She stood behind the door , looking at the open door of the parlour . 
Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly , and then his footsteps came across the room . 
She could not see his face where she stood . 
The parlour door slammed , and the place was silent again .

`` Am I mad ? '' 
Cuss began abruptly , as he entered the shabby little study . 
`` Do I look like an insane person ? ''
