At first I was as incapable as a swathed infant -- stepping with limbs I could not see . 
I was weak and very hungry . 
I went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass , at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes , fainter than mist . 
I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass . 
`` It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process . 
`` I slept during the forenoon , pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light , and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking . 
My strength had returned . 
I sat up and listened and heard a whispering . 
I sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus , and to distribute it about the room , so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement . 
Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called , first my landlord 's , and then two others .
