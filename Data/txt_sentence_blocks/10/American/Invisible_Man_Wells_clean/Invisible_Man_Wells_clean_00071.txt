No one ventured upstairs . 
How the stranger occupied himself is unknown . 
Now and then he would stride violently up and down , and twice came an outburst of curses , a tearing of paper , and a violent smashing of bottles . 
The little group of scared but curious people increased . 
Mrs. Huxter came over ; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties -- for it was Whit Monday -- joined the group with confused interrogations . 
Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds . 
He could see nothing , but gave reason for supposing that he did , and others of the Iping youth presently joined him . 
It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays , and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths , a shooting gallery , and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy . 
The gentlemen wore blue jerseys , the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes . 
Woodyer , of the `` Purple Fawn , '' and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns -LRB- which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee -RRB- across the road .
