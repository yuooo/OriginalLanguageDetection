He had sat down , after one nervous glance out of the window , with the air of a man who has talking to do . 
His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the breakfast-table -- a headless , handless dressing-gown , wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette . 
`` It 's simple enough -- and credible enough , '' said Griffin , putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand . 
`` No doubt , to you , but -- '' Kemp laughed . 
`` Well , yes ; to me it seemed wonderful at first , no doubt . 
But now , great God !

`` Chesilstowe ? ''
