My most immediate problem was to get clothing . 
What to do with my face puzzled me . 
Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops -- news , sweets , toys , stationery , belated Christmas tomfoolery , and so forth -- an array of masks and noses . 
I realised that problem was solved . 
In a flash I saw my course . 
I turned about , no longer aimless , and went -- circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways , towards the back streets north of the Strand ; for I remembered , though not very distinctly where , that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district . 
`` The day was cold , with a nipping wind down the northward running streets . 
I walked fast to avoid being overtaken . 
Every crossing was a danger , every passenger a thing to watch alertly . 
One man as I was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street , turned upon me abruptly and came into me , sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom .
