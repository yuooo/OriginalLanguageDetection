`` I could have swore I heard a voice , '' he whispered . 
`` Of course you did . '' 
`` It 's there again , '' said Mr. Marvel , closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture . 
He was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently , and left more dazed than ever . 
`` Do n't be a fool , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm -- off -- my -- blooming -- chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` It 's no good . 
It 's fretting about them blarsted boots . 
I 'm off my blessed blooming chump . 
Or it 's spirits . ''
