No sooner had Fearenside 's dog caught sight of him , however , than it began to bristle and growl savagely , and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop , and then sprang straight at his hand . 
`` Whup ! '' 
cried Hall , jumping back , for he was no hero with dogs , and Fearenside howled , `` Lie down ! '' 
and snatched his whip . 
They saw the dog 's teeth had slipped the hand , heard a kick , saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger 's leg , and heard the rip of his trousering . 
Then the finer end of Fearenside 's whip reached his property , and the dog , yelping with dismay , retreated under the wheels of the waggon . 
It was all the business of a swift half-minute . 
No one spoke , everyone shouted . 
The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg , made as if he would stoop to the latter , then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn . 
They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom .
