All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and , as Mrs. Hall testifies , for the most part in silence . 
But once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit , and the smash of a bottle flung violently down , and then a rapid pacing athwart the room . 
Fearing `` something was the matter , '' she went to the door and listened , not caring to knock . 
`` I ca n't go on , '' he was raving . 
`` I _ ca n't _ go on . 
Three hundred thousand , four hundred thousand ! 
The huge multitude ! 
Cheated ! 
All my life it may take me ! 
... Patience !
