But it 's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging . 
My first stroke of luck ! 
Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night . 
You must stand that ! 
It 's a filthy nuisance , my blood showing , is n't it ? 
Quite a clot over there . 
Gets visible as it coagulates , I see . 
It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive ... . 
I 've been in the house three hours . '' 
`` But how 's it done ? ''
