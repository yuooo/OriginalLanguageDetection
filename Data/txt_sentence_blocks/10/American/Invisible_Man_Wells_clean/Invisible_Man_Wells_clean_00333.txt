His blood be upon his own head . '' 
THE WICKSTEED MURDER The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp 's house in a state of blind fury . 
A little child playing near Kemp 's gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside , so that its ankle was broken , and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human perceptions . 
No one knows where he went nor what he did . 
But one can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon , up the hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock , raging and despairing at his intolerable fate , and sheltering at last , heated and weary , amid the thickets of Hintondean , to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species . 
That seems to most probable refuge for him , for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon . 
One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time , and what plans he devised . 
No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by Kemp 's treachery , and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit , we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned . 
Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to him , for he had evidently counted on Kemp 's co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world . 
At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday , and no living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two .
