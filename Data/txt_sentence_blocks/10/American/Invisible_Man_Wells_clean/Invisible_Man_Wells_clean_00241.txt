It was last December . 
I had taken a room in London , a large unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near Great Portland Street . 
The room was soon full of the appliances I had bought with his money ; the work was going on steadily , successfully , drawing near an end . 
I was like a man emerging from a thicket , and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy . 
I went to bury him . 
My mind was still on this research , and I did not lift a finger to save his character . 
I remember the funeral , the cheap hearse , the scant ceremony , the windy frost-bitten hillside , and the old college friend of his who read the service over him -- a shabby , black , bent old man with a snivelling cold . 
`` I remember walking back to the empty house , through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town . 
Every way the roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds . 
I remember myself as a gaunt black figure , going along the slippery , shiny pavement , and the strange sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability , the sordid commercialism of the place .
