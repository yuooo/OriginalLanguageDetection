`` Get up , old girl , '' said Hall . 
`` I s ` pose I must see ` bout this . '' 
Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved . 
Instead of `` seeing ` bout it , '' however , Hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge , and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point . 
But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements . 
`` You wim ' do n't know everything , '' said Mr. Hall , resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity . 
And after the stranger had gone to bed , which he did about half-past nine , Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife 's furniture , just to show that the stranger was n't master there , and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left . 
When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger 's luggage when it came next day . 
`` You mind you own business , Hall , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` and I 'll mind mine . '' 
She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger , and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind .
