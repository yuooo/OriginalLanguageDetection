And before nightfall , too , a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside . 
Going from whispering mouth to mouth , swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country , passed the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed . 
If our supposition that the Invisible Man 's refuge was the Hintondean thickets , then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon . 
We can not know what the project was , but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming . 
Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter . 
It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit , not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock 's lodge gate . 
Everything points to a desperate struggle -- the trampled ground , the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received , his splintered walking-stick ; but why the attack was made , save in a murderous frenzy , it is impossible to imagine . 
Indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable . 
Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or forty-six , steward to Lord Burdock , of inoffensive habits and appearance , the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist . 
Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence .
