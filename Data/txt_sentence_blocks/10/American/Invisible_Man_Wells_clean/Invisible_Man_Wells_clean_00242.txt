`` I did not feel a bit sorry for my father . 
He seemed to me to be the victim of his own foolish sentimentality . 
The current cant required my attendance at his funeral , but it was really not my affair . 
`` But going along the High Street , my old life came back to me for a space , for I met the girl I had known ten years since . 
Our eyes met . 
`` Something moved me to turn back and talk to her . 
She was a very ordinary person . 
`` It was all like a dream , that visit to the old places . 
I did not feel then that I was lonely , that I had come out from the world into a desolate place . 
I appreciated my loss of sympathy , but I put it down to the general inanity of things .
