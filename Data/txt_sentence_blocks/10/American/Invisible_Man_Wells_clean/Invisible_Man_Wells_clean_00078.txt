`` Oh , my Gard ! '' 
said some one . 
Then off they came . 
It was worse than anything . 
Mrs. Hall , standing open-mouthed and horror-struck , shrieked at what she saw , and made for the door of the house . 
Everyone began to move . 
They were prepared for scars , disfigurements , tangible horrors , but nothing ! 
The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar , making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them . 
Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps . 
For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation , was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him , and then -- nothingness , no visible thing at all !
