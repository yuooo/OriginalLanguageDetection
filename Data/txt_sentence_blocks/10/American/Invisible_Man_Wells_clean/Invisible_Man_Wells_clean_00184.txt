DR. KEMP 'S VISITOR Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him . 
Crack , crack , crack , they came one after the other . 
`` Hullo ! '' 
said Dr. Kemp , putting his pen into his mouth again and listening . 
`` Who 's letting off revolvers in Burdock ? 
What are the asses at now ? '' 
He went to the south window , threw it up , and leaning out stared down on the network of windows , beaded gas-lamps and shops , with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night . 
`` Looks like a crowd down the hill , '' he said , `` by ` The Cricketers , ' '' and remained watching . 
Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships ' lights shone , and the pier glowed -- a little illuminated , facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light .
