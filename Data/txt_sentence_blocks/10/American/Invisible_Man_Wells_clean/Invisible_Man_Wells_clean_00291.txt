`` It was a queer little room , poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner . 
On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me , Kemp , to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal . 
And his table manners were irritating . 
Three doors opened into the little room , one going upstairs and one down , but they were all shut . 
I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back . 
Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time . 
`` The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel , but for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating . 
But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot , and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth , he took the whole lot of things after him . 
His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him -- as he would have done ; I never saw such a man for shutting doors -- and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery . 
I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up , and then , finding no good in keeping down there , and the brick floor being cold on my feet , I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire .
