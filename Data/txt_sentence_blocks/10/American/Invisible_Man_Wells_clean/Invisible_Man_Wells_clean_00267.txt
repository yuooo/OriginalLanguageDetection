It was a bright day in January and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing . 
Foolish as it seems to me now , I had not reckoned that , transparent or not , I was still amenable to the weather and all its consequences . 
`` Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head . 
I ran round and got into the cab . 
And so , shivering , scared , and sniffing with the first intimations of a cold , and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention , I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past Tottenham Court Road . 
My mood was as different from that in which I had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine . 
This invisibility indeed ! 
The one thought that possessed me was -- how was I to get out of the scrape I was in . 
`` We crawled past Mudie 's , and there a tall woman with five or six yellow-labelled books hailed my cab , and I sprang out just in time to escape her , shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight . 
I made off up the roadway to Bloomsbury Square , intending to strike north past the Museum and so get into the quiet district .
