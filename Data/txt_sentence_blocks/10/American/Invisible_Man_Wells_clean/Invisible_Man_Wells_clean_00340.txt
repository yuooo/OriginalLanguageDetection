This announces the first day of the Terror . 
Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen , tell your Colonel of Police , and the rest of them ; it is under me -- the Terror ! 
This is day one of year one of the new epoch -- the Epoch of the Invisible Man . 
I am Invisible Man the First . 
To begin with the rule will be easy . 
The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example -- a man named Kemp . 
Death starts for him to-day . 
He may lock himself away , hide himself away , get guards about him , put on armour if he likes -- Death , the unseen Death , is coming . 
Let him take precautions ; it will impress my people . 
Death starts from the pillar box by midday .
