Somebody ran by outside . 
`` Fire , perhaps , '' said the barman . 
Footsteps approached , running heavily , the door was pushed open violently , and Marvel , weeping and dishevelled , his hat gone , the neck of his coat torn open , rushed in , made a convulsive turn , and attempted to shut the door . 
It was held half open by a strap . 
`` Coming ! '' 
he bawled , his voice shrieking with terror . 
`` He 's coming . 
The ` Visible Man ! 
After me ! 
For Gawd 's sake !
