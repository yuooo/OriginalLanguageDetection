The Invisible Man A Grotesque Romance By H.G. Wells CONTENTS THE STRANGE MAN 'S ARRIVAL The stranger came early in February , one wintry day , through a biting wind and a driving snow , the last snowfall of the year , over the down , walking from Bramblehurst railway station , and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand . 
He was wrapped up from head to foot , and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose ; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest , and added a white crest to the burden he carried . 
He staggered into the `` Coach and Horses '' more dead than alive , and flung his portmanteau down . 
`` A fire , '' he cried , `` in the name of human charity ! 
A room and a fire ! '' 
He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar , and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain . 
And with that much introduction , that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table , he took up his quarters in the inn . 
Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands . 
A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck , let alone a guest who was no `` haggler , '' and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune . 
As soon as the bacon was well under way , and Millie , her lymphatic aid , had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt , she carried the cloth , plates , and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost eclat .
