On the counterpane was a mess of blood , and the sheet had been torn . 
He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressing-table . 
On the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there . 
Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say , `` Good Heavens ! 
-- Kemp ! '' 
But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices . 
He stood staring at the tumbled sheets . 
Was that really a voice ? 
He looked about again , but noticed nothing further than the disordered and blood-stained bed . 
Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room , near the wash-hand stand .
