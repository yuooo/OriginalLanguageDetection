He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her . 
Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked , and to his great surprise learned that Dolokhov the brawler , Dolokhov the bully , lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister , and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers . 
Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone . 
Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors . 
The night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but , as he often did , remained in his father 's room , that huge room in which Count Bezukhov had died . 
He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had happened to him , but could not do so . 
Such a storm of feelings , thoughts , and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep , nor even remain in one place , but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps . 
Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage , with bare shoulders and a languid , passionate look on her face , and then immediately he saw beside her Dolokhov 's handsome , insolent , hard , and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet , and then that same face pale , quivering , and suffering , as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow . 
`` What has happened ? '' 
he asked himself .
