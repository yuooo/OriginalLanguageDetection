This was Speranski , Secretary of State , reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt , where he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon . 
Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak . 
He spoke slowly , with assurance that he would be listened to , and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing . 
Prince Andrew followed Speranski 's every word and movement with particular attention . 
As happens to some people , especially to men who judge those near to them severely , he always on meeting anyone new - especially anyone whom , like Speranski , he knew by reputation - expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities . 
Speranski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the palace . 
He did not say that the Emperor had kept him , and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty . 
When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew , Speranski slowly turned his eyes to Bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence . 
`` I am very glad to make your acquaintance . 
I had heard of you , as everyone has , '' he said after a pause .
