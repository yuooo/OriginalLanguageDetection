He had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kutuzov . 
Now having come to the army , he informed Kutuzov of the Emperor 's displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance . 
The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days ' time . 
The old man , experienced in court as well as in military affairs - this same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereign 's wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and heir -- apparent from the army -- who on his own authority and contrary to the Emperor 's will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow , now realized at once that his day was over , that his part was played , and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his . 
And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court . 
He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished ; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest . 
On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna -- his `` dear Vilna '' as he called it . 
Twice during his career Kutuzov had been governor of Vilna . 
In that wealthy town , which had not been injured , he found old friends and associations , besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived . 
And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and , as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed , immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed , as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all .
