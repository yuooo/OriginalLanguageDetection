And a consciousness of this , and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken , was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812 .

Those who went away , taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings , did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one 's children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits , but unobtrusively , simply , organically , and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results .
