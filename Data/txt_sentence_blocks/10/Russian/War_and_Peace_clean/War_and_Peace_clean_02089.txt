Pierre stopped , being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran . 
The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp , but above Pierre 's head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily . 
One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre . 
The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it , placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels , and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse . 
One of the wounded , an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot , caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre . 
`` I say , fellow countryman ! 
Will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow ? '' 
he asked . 
Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question . 
He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded , now at the cart by which he was standing , in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying .
