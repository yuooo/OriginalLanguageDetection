`` What is a ` ticket ' ? '' 
Nicholas inquired . 
`` I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening , showing how they have behaved . '' 
Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him , and continued to turn over the pages and read . 
In the diary was set down everything in the children 's lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods . 
They were for the most part quite insignificant trifles , but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either , now that he read this diary about his children for the first time . 
Under the date `` 5 '' was entered : Mitya was naughty at table . 
Papa said he was to have no pudding . 
He had none , but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating ! 
I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness .
