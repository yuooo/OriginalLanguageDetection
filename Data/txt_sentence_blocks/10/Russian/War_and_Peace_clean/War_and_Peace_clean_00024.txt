she went on , turning to Prince Hippolyte . 
`` Fetch me my workbag . '' 
There was a general movement as the princess , smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once , sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat . 
`` Now I am all right , '' she said , and asking the vicomte to begin , she took up her work . 
Prince Hippolyte , having brought the workbag , joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her . 
Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister , but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly . 
His features were like his sister 's , but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous , self-satisfied , youthful , and constant smile of animation , and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure , his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence , while his body was thin and weak . 
His eyes , nose , and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant , wearied grimace , and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions . 
`` It 's not going to be a ghost story ? '' 
said he , sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette , as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak .
