It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally , and in the cold , repellent glance the Emperor gave him , he now found further confirmation of this surmise . 
The courtiers explained the Emperor 's neglect of him by His Majesty 's displeasure at Bolkonski 's not having served since 1805 . 
`` I know myself that one can not help one 's sympathies and antipathies , '' thought Prince Andrew , `` so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally , but the project will speak for itself . '' 
He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal , a friend of his father 's . 
The field marshal made an appointment to see him , received him graciously , and promised to inform the Emperor . 
A few days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War , Count Arakcheev . 
On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev 's waiting room at nine in the morning . 
He did not know Arakcheev personally , had never seen him , and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man . 
`` He is Minister of War , a man trusted by the Emperor , and I need not concern myself about his personal qualities : he has been commissioned to consider my project , so he alone can get it adopted , '' thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev 's waiting room . 
During his service , chiefly as an adjutant , Prince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men , and the different types of such rooms were well known to him .
