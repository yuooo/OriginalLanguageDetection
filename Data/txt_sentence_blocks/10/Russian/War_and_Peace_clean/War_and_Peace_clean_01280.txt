The count was at the other end of the room . 
She and the countess and Sonya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers , with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone . 
Prince Andrew with a lady passed by , evidently not recognizing them . 
The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at Natasha as one looks at a wall . 
Boris passed them twice and each time turned away . 
Berg and his wife , who were not dancing , came up to them . 
This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha -- as if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball . 
She did not listen to or look at Vera , who was telling her something about her own green dress . 
At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner -LRB- he had danced with three -RRB- and the music ceased . 
A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back , though as it was they were already close to the wall , and from the gallery resounded the distinct , precise , enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz .
