Well , what else do you want ? 
... '' `` Come , that 's right , Count ! '' 
cried the staff captain , turning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand . 
`` I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , `` he 's a fine fellow . '' 
`` That 's better , Count , '' said the staff captain , beginning to address Rostov by his title , as if in recognition of his confession . 
`` Go and apologize , your excellency . 
Yes , go ! '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'll do anything . 
No one shall hear a word from me , '' said Rostov in an imploring voice , `` but I ca n't apologize , by God I ca n't , do what you will ! 
How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness ? ''
