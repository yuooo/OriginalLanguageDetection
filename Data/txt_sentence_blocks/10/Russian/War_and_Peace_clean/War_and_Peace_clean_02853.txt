One of them fell in the mud under his horse 's feet . 
Cossacks were crowding about a hut , busy with something . 
From the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose . 
Petya galloped up , and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman , clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him . 
`` Hurrah ! 
... Lads ! 
... ours ! '' 
shouted Petya , and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street . 
He could hear shooting ahead of him . 
Cossacks , hussars , and ragged Russian prisoners , who had come running from both sides of the road , were shouting something loudly and incoherently .
