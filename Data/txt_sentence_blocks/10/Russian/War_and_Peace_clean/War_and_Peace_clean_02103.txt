`` There they are ... bringing her , coming ... There they are ... They 'll be here in a minute ... '' voices were suddenly heard saying ; and officers , soldiers , and militiamen began running forward along the road . 
A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino . 
First along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks , bareheaded and with arms reversed . 
From behind them came the sound of church singing . 
Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the procession . 
`` They are bringing her , our Protectress ! 
... The Iberian Mother of God ! '' 
someone cried . 
`` The Smolensk Mother of God , '' another corrected him . 
The militiamen , both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery , threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession .
