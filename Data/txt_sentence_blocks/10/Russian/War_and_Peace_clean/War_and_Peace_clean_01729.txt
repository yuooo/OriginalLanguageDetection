A French colonel of hussars , who had evidently just left his bed , came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse , accompanied by two hussars . 
The officer , the soldiers , and their horses all looked smart and well kept . 
It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim , almost like that of peacetime maneuvers , but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes , and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign . 
The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn , but was polite and evidently understood Balashev 's importance . 
He led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately , as the Emperor 's quarters were , he believed , not far off . 
They rode through the village of Rykonty , past tethered French hussar horses , past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform , and came out at the other end of the village . 
The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashev and conduct him to his destination . 
The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure . 
They had hardly ridden up a hill , past a tavern , before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them . 
In front of the group , on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun , rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders .
