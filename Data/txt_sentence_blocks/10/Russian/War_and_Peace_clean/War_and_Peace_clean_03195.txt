If I reflect on an action still more remote , ten years ago or more , then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed . 
The farther I go back in memory , or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment , the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action . 
In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity . 
A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants , but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible . 
And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear . 
The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of Bismarck , and so on . 
The Napoleonic wars still seem to us , though already questionably , to be the outcome of their heroes ' will . 
But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we can not imagine the modern history of Europe , though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people . 
In regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyone 's head today to suppose that the renovation of the European world depended on Attila 's caprice . 
The farther back in history the object of our observation lies , the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability .
