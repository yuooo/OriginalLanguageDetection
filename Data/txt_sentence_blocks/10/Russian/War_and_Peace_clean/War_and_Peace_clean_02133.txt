Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin , who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment . 
In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited . 
He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him . 
`` A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it ! 
Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz ? 
The French losses were almost equal to ours , but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle , and we did lose it . 
And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there , we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could . 
` We 've lost , so let us run , ' and we ran . 
If we had not said that till the evening , heaven knows what might not have happened . 
But tomorrow we sha n't say it !
