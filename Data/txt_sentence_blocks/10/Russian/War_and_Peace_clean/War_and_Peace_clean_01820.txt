Natasha was calmer but no happier . 
She not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure -- balls , promenades , concerts , and theaters - but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter . 
She could not sing . 
As soon as she began to laugh , or tried to sing by herself , tears choked her : tears of remorse , tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return , tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy . 
Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy , in face of her sorrow . 
Without any need of self-restraint , no wish to coquet ever entered her head . 
She said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna , the buffoon . 
Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy . 
Besides , she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope . 
The previous autumn , the hunting , `` Uncle , '' and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully .
