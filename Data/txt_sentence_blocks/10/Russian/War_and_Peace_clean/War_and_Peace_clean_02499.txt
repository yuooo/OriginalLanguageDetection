Daniel Terentich made no reply , and again for a long time they were all silent . 
The glow spread , rising and failing , farther and farther still . 
`` God have mercy ... . 
It 's windy and dry ... '' said another voice . 
`` Just look ! 
See what it 's doing now . 
O Lord ! 
You can even see the crows flying . 
Lord have mercy on us sinners ! '' 
`` They 'll put it out , no fear ! ''
