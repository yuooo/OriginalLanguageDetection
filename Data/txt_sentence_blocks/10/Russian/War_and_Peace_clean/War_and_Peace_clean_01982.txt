Alpatych was not satisfied with this reply . 
`` Eh , Dron , it will turn out badly ! '' 
he said , shaking his head . 
`` The power is in your hands , '' Dron rejoined sadly . 
`` Eh , Dron , drop it ! '' 
Alpatych repeated , withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron 's feet . 
`` I can see through you and three yards into the ground under you , '' he continued , gazing at the floor in front of Dron . 
Dron was disconcerted , glanced furtively at Alpatych and again lowered his eyes . 
`` You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess ' things . 
And do n't go to any meeting yourself , do you hear ? ''
