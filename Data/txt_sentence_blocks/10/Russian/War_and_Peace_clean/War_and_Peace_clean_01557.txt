The door opened and the old prince , in a dress , ing gown and a white nightcap , came in . 
`` Ah , madam ! '' 
he began . 
`` Madam , Countess ... Countess Rostova , if I am not mistaken ... I beg you to excuse me , to excuse me ... I did not know , madam . 
God is my witness , I did not know you had honored us with a visit , and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter . 
I beg you to excuse me ... God is my witness , I did n't know - '' he repeated , stressing the word `` God '' so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at Natasha . 
Nor did the latter , having risen and curtsied , know what to do . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably . 
`` I beg you to excuse me , excuse me ! 
God is my witness , I did not know , '' muttered the old man , and after looking Natasha over from head to foot he went out .
