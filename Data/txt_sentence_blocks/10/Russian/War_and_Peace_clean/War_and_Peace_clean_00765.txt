His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot . 
His predictions were being justified . 
Part of the Russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position . 
He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen , the Russian columns , their bayonets glittering , were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist . 
From information he had received the evening before , from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night , by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns , and from all indications , he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them , and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army , and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked . 
But still he did not begin the engagement . 
Today was a great day for him -- the anniversary of his coronation . 
Before dawn he had slept for a few hours , and refreshed , vigorous , and in good spirits , he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds . 
He sat motionless , looking at the heights visible above the mist , and his cold face wore that special look of confident , self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love . 
The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention .
