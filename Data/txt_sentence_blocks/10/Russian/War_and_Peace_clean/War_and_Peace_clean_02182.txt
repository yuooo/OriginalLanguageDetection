remarked the adjutant . 
`` No it 's not that , but her action seems so jerky , '' said Pierre in a puzzled tone . 
`` Why ... she 's wounded ! '' 
said the adjutant . 
`` In the off foreleg above the knee . 
A bullet , no doubt . 
I congratulate you , Count , on your baptism of fire ! '' 
Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps , behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action , deafening them with the noise of firing , they came to a small wood . 
There it was cool and quiet , with a scent of autumn . 
Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot .
