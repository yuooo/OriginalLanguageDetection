When he entered the Rostovs ' drawing room Natasha was in her own room . 
When she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room , flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile . 
Boris remembered Natasha in a short dress , with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous , childish laughter , as he had known her four years before ; and so he was taken aback when quite a different Natasha entered , and his face expressed rapturous astonishment . 
This expression on his face pleased Natasha . 
`` Well , do you recognize your little madcap playmate ? '' 
asked the countess . 
Boris kissed Natasha 's hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her . 
`` How handsome you have grown ! '' 
`` I should think so ! '' 
replied Natasha 's laughing eyes .
