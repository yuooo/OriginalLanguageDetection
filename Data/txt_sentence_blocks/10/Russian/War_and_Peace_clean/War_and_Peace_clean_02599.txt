Sonya 's letter written from Troitsa , which had come as an answer to Nicholas ' prayer , was prompted by this : the thought of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess ' mind more and more . 
She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening , and Sonya 's life in the countess ' house had grown harder and harder , especially after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo . 
The countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya . 
But a few days before they left Moscow , moved and excited by all that was going on , she called Sonya to her and , instead of reproaching and making demands on her , tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with Nicholas . 
`` I shall not be at peace till you promise me this . '' 
Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything , but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her . 
She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up . 
To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya 's habit . 
Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth , and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it . 
But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others , and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world .
