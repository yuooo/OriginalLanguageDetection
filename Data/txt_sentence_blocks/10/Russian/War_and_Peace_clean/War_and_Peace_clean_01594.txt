To the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual , but she was far less tranquil and happy than before . 
On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her parish church -- the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague . 
`` I do n't like those fashionable churches , '' she said , evidently priding herself on her independence of thought . 
`` God is the same every where . 
We have an excellent priest , he conducts the service decently and with dignity , and the deacon is the same . 
What holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir ? 
I do n't like it , it 's just self-indulgence ! '' 
Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them . 
Her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays ; neither she nor the servants worked , and they all wore holiday dress and went to church . 
At her table there were extra dishes at dinner , and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig .
