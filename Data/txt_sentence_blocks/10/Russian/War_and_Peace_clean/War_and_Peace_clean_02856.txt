After speaking to the senior French officer , who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered , Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya , who lay motionless with outstretched arms . 
`` Done for ! '' 
he said with a frown , and went to the gate to meet Denisov who was riding toward him . 
`` Killed ? '' 
cried Denisov , recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude -- very familiar to him -- in which Petya 's body was lying . 
`` Done for ! '' 
repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure , and he went quickly up to the prisoners , who were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up . 
`` We wo n't take them ! '' 
he called out to Denisov . 
Denisov did not reply ; he rode up to Petya , dismounted , and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained , mud-bespattered face which had already gone white .
