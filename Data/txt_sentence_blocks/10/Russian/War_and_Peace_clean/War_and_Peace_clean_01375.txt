Nicholas said timidly , conscious at the sight of the weather , the hounds , and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions , as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress . 
`` What orders , your excellency ? '' 
said the huntsman in his deep bass , deep as a proto-deacon 's and hoarse with hallooing -- and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master , who was silent . 
`` Can you resist it ? '' 
those eyes seemed to be asking . 
`` It 's a good day , eh ? 
For a hunt and a gallop , eh ? '' 
asked Nicholas , scratching Milka behind the ears . 
Daniel did not answer , but winked instead . 
`` I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen , '' his bass boomed out after a minute 's pause .
