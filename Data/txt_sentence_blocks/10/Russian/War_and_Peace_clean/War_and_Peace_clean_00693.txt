They 're coming ! '' 
Alarmed voices were heard , and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops . 
From the direction of Olmutz in front of them , a group was seen approaching . 
And at that moment , though the day was still , a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs . 
It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors . 
One voice was heard shouting : `` Eyes front ! '' 
Then , like the crowing of cocks at sunrise , this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent . 
In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard . 
This was the Emperors ' suites . 
The Emperors rode up to the flank , and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march .
