Natasha , on the other hand , having put on her best gown , was in the highest spirits . 
`` They ca n't help liking me , '' she thought . 
`` Everybody always has liked me , and I am so willing to do anything they wish , so ready to be fond of him -- for being his father -- and of her -- for being his sister -- that there is no reason for them not to like me ... '' They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and entered the vestibule . 
`` Well , the Lord have mercy on us ! '' 
said the count , half in jest , half in earnest ; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home . 
When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants . 
The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another . 
Then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something , mentioning the princess . 
At last an old , cross looking footman came and announced to the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving , but that the princess begged them to walk up . 
The first person who came to meet the visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne .
