`` It 's not a case of carting . '' 
`` But why did n't you tell me , Dronushka ? 
Is n't it possible to help them ? 
I 'll do all I can ... '' To Princess Mary it was strange that now , at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul , there could be rich people and poor , and the rich could refrain from helping the poor . 
She had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as `` landlord 's corn '' which was sometimes given to the peasants . 
She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need , she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give . 
She was glad such cares presented themselves , enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief . 
She began asking Dron about the peasants ' needs and what there was in Bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord . 
`` But we have grain belonging to my brother ? '' 
she said .
