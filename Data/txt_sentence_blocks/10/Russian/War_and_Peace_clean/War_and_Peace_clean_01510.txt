Yet he had to live and to find occupation . 
It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems , so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them . 
He frequented every kind of society , drank much , bought pictures , engaged in building , and above all -- read . 
He read , and read everything that came to hand . 
On coming home , while his valets were still taking off his things , he picked up a book and began to read . 
From reading he passed to sleeping , from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the Club , from gossip to carousals and women ; from carousals back to gossip , reading , and wine . 
Drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity . 
Though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him , he drank a great deal . 
He was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body , an amiability toward all his fellows , and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply . 
Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought .
