`` How about the horses ? '' 
he asked , without looking at Pierre . 
`` The exchange horses have just come , '' answered the servant . 
`` Will you not rest here ? '' 
`` No , tell them to harness . '' 
`` Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all , and without promising to help me ? '' 
thought Pierre , rising with downcast head ; and he began to pace the room , glancing occasionally at the Mason . 
`` Yes , I never thought of it , but I have led a contemptible and profligate life , though I did not like it and did not want to , '' thought Pierre . 
`` But this man knows the truth and , if he wished to , could disclose it to me . ''
