Pierre 's insanity consisted in not waiting , as he used to do , to discover personal attributes which he termed `` good qualities '' in people before loving them ; his heart was now overflowing with love , and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them . 
After Pierre 's departure that first evening , when Natasha had said to Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile : `` He looks just , yes , just as if he had come out of a Russian bath -- in a short coat and with his hair cropped , '' something hidden and unknown to herself , but irrepressible , awoke in Natasha 's soul . 
Everything : her face , walk , look , and voice , was suddenly altered . 
To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction . 
From that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her . 
She no longer complained of her position , did not say a word about the past , and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future . 
She spoke little of Pierre , but when Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile . 
The change that took place in Natasha at first surprised Princess Mary ; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her . 
`` Can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon ? '' 
she thought when she reflected on the change .
