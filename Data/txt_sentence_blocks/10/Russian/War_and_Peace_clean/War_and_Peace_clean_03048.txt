I ca n't bear these ladies and all these civilities ! '' 
said he aloud in Sonya 's presence , evidently unable to repress his vexation , after the princess ' carriage had disappeared . 
`` Oh , Nicholas , how can you talk like that ? '' 
cried Sonya , hardly able to conceal her delight . 
`` She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her ! '' 
Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more . 
But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day . 
She sang her praises , insisted that her son must call on her , expressed a wish to see her often , but yet always became ill-humored when she began to talk about her . 
Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess , but his silence irritated her .
