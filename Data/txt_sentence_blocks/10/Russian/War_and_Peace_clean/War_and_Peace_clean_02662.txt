`` There , you see how strangely fate has brought us together , '' said he , breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha . 
`` She looks after me all the time . '' 
Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing . 
He , the sensitive , tender Prince Andrew , how could he say that , before her whom he loved and who loved him ? 
Had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone . 
If he had not known that he was dying , how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence ? 
The only explanation was that he was indifferent , because something else , much more important , had been revealed to him . 
The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off . 
`` Mary came by way of Ryazan , '' said Natasha . 
Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary , and only after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it herself .
