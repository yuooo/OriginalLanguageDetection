It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing , but as if the army itself , rejoicing at the Emperors ' approach , had naturally burst into music . 
Amid these sounds , only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard . 
He gave the words of greeting , and the first regiment roared `` Hurrah ! '' 
so deafeningly , continuously , and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted . 
Rostov , standing in the front lines of Kutuzov 's army which the Tsar approached first , experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army : a feeling of self-forgetfulness , a proud consciousness of might , and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph . 
He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass -LRB- and he himself an insignificant atom in it -RRB- would go through fire and water , commit crime , die , or perform deeds of highest heroism , and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word . 
`` Hurrah ! 
Hurrah ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
thundered from all sides , one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march , and then `` Hurrah ! ''
