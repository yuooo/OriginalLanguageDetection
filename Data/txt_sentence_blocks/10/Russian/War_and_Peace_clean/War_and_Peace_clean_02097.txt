Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and , winding down and up , rose higher and higher to the village of Valuevo visible about four miles away , where Napoleon was then stationed . 
Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon . 
Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road , the cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the sun . 
Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse , to right and left of the forest and the road , smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops -- ours and the enemy 's . 
The ground to the right -- along the course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers -- was broken and hilly . 
Between the hollows the villages of Bezubova and Zakharino showed in the distance . 
On the left the ground was more level ; there were fields of grain , and the smoking ruins of Semenovsk , which had been burned down , could be seen . 
All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations . 
Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find , but only fields , meadows , troops , woods , the smoke of campfires , villages , mounds , and streams ; and try as he would he could descry no military `` position '' in this place which teemed with life , nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy 's . 
`` I must ask someone who knows , '' he thought , and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure .
