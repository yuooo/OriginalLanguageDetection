exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice , seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside . 
The soldier fell , got up , and ran away . 
But his comrade , throwing down the boots and drawing his sword , moved threateningly toward Pierre . 
`` Voyons , Pas de betises ! '' 
* he cried . 
* `` Look here , no nonsense ! '' 
Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold . 
He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and , before the latter had time to draw his sword , knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists . 
Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around , and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner . 
The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them .
