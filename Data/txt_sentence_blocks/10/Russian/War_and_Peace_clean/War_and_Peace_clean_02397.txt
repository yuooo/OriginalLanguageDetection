He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Ermolov , coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge , had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge . 
The crowd , crushing one another , upsetting carts , and shouting and squeezing desperately , had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward . 
Meanwhile , the city itself was deserted . 
There was hardly anyone in the streets . 
The gates and shops were all closed , only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard . 
Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard . 
The Povarskaya was quite still and deserted . 
The huge courtyard of the Rostovs ' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses , and not a soul was to be seen there . 
In the great drawing room of the house , which had been left with all it contained , were two people . 
They were the yard porter Ignat , and the page boy Mishka , Vasilich 's grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather .
