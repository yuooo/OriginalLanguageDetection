From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes , drawing himself up obsequiously , and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals , bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements , and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief , it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander . 
Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment , in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the same time , was in splendid condition . 
There were only 217 sick and stragglers . 
Everything was in good order except the boots . 
Kutuzov walked through the ranks , sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war , sometimes also to the soldiers . 
Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly , pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone , but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was . 
The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion , fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief 's regarding the regiment . 
Behind Kutuzov , at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard , followed some twenty men of his suite . 
These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed . 
Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant .
