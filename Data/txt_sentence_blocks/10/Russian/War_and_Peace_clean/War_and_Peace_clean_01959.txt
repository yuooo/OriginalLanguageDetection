It was impossible to make out what he wanted . 
He was lifted up , carried to his study , and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late . 
The doctor , who was fetched that same night , bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side . 
It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills , and next day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo , the doctor accompanying him . 
By the time they reached Bogucharovo , Dessalles and the little prince had already left for Moscow . 
For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo , ever in the same state , getting neither better nor worse . 
He was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse . 
He muttered unceasingly , his eyebrows and lips twitching , and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not . 
One thing was certain -- that he was suffering and wished to say something . 
But what it was , no one could tell : it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man , or it might relate to public affairs , or possibly to family concerns .
