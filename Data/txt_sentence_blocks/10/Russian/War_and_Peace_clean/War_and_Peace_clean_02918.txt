But how did that old man , alone , in opposition to the general opinion , so truly discern the importance of the people 's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it ? 
The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength . 
Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner , contrary to the Tsar 's wish , to select him -- an old man in disfavor -- to be their representative in the national war . 
And only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he , the commander in chief , devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them . 
That simple , modest , and therefore truly great , figure could not be cast in the false mold of a European hero -- the supposed ruler of men -- that history has invented . 
To a lackey no man can be great , for a lackey has his own conception of greatness . 
The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of Krasnoe . 
Toward evening -- after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places , and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders -- when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle , Kutuzov left Krasnoe and went to Dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred . 
The day was clear and frosty . 
Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump little white horse , followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back .
