Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself , and Berg and Vera immediately began their evening party , interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest . 
Vera , having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the French embassy , at once began accordingly . 
Berg , having decided that masculine conversation was required , interrupted his wife 's remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria , and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them . 
Though the conversation was very incoherent and Vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element , both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that , even if only one guest was present , their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk , tea , and lighted candles . 
Before long Boris , Berg 's old comrade , arrived . 
There was a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera . 
After Boris came a lady with the colonel , then the general himself , then the Rostovs , and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties . 
Berg and Vera could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room , at the sound of the disconnected talk , the rustling of dresses , and the bowing and scraping . 
Everything was just as everybody always has it , especially so the general , who admired the apartment , patted Berg on the shoulder , and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston . 
The general sat down by Count Ilya Rostov , who was next to himself the most important guest .
