`` Excuse me , General , '' interrupted Kutuzov , also turning to Prince Andrew . 
`` Look here , my dear fellow , get from Kozlovski all the reports from our scouts . 
Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these , '' he said , handing him several papers , `` make a neat memorandum in French out of all this , showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian army , and then give it to his excellency . '' 
Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov would have liked to tell him . 
He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both , stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room . 
Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia , he had changed greatly during that period . 
In the expression of his face , in his movements , in his walk , scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence . 
He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others , but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work . 
His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him , his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive . 
Kutuzov , whom he had overtaken in Poland , had received him very kindly , promised not to forget him , distinguished him above the other adjutants , and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions .
