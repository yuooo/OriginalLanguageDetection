It had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious . 
His words and actions flowed from him as evenly , inevitably , and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower . 
He could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately . 
When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the Rostovs at Yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there , in spite of her aunt 's efforts to dissuade her -- and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her . 
Whether it were difficult or easy , possible or impossible , she did not ask and did not want to know : it was her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying , but to do everything possible to take his son to him , and so she prepared to set off . 
That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself , Princess Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son . 
In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start . 
Her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh , a semiopen trap , and a baggage cart . 
With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne , little Nicholas and his tutor , her old nurse , three maids , Tikhon , and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her . 
The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of , and the roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk , Ryazan , Vladimir , and Shuya was very long and , as post horses were not everywhere obtainable , very difficult , and near Ryazan where the French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous .
