`` She is a very admirable and excellent young woman , '' said she , `` and you must go and call on her . 
You would at least be seeing somebody , and I think it must be dull for you only seeing us . '' 
`` But I do n't in the least want to , Mamma . '' 
`` You used to want to , and now you do n't . 
Really I do n't understand you , my dear . 
One day you are dull , and the next you refuse to see anyone . '' 
`` But I never said I was dull . '' 
`` Why , you said yourself you do n't want even to see her . 
She is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her , but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head . 
You hide everything from me . ''
