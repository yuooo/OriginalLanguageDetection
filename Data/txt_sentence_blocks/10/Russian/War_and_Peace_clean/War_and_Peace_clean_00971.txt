Natasha too , with her quick instinct , had instantly noticed her brother 's condition . 
But , though she noticed it , she was herself in such high spirits at that moment , so far from sorrow , sadness , or self-reproach , that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do . 
`` No , I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone 's sorrow , '' she felt , and she said to herself : `` No , I must be mistaken , he must be feeling happy , just as I am . '' 
`` Now , Sonya ! '' 
she said , going to the very middle of the room , where she considered the resonance was best . 
Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly , as ballet dancers do , Natasha , rising energetically from her heels to her toes , stepped to the middle of the room and stood still . 
`` Yes , that 's me ! '' 
she seemed to say , answering the rapt gaze with which Denisov followed her . 
`` And what is she so pleased about ? '' 
thought Nicholas , looking at his sister .
