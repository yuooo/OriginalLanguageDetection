His eyes narrowed disdainfully , he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps . 
This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them , and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival . 
A wax candle stood at each side of the minister 's bent bald head with its gray temples . 
He went on reading to the end , without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps . 
`` Take this and deliver it , '' said he to his adjutant , handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger . 
Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov 's army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with , or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impression . 
`` But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me , '' he thought . 
The minister drew the remaining papers together , arranged them evenly , and then raised his head . 
He had an intellectual and distinctive head , but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm , intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him . 
His face took on the stupid artificial smile -LRB- which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality -RRB- of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another .
