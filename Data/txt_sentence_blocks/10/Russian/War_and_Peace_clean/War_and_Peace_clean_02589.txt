Nicholas also noticed that look and , as if understanding it , flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness . 
As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society , and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again ; but all the same the governor 's wife went on with her matchmaking , passing on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa , and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary . 
For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop 's house before Mass. . 
Though Rostov told the governeor 's wife that he would not make any declaration to Princess Mary , he promised to go . 
As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right , so now , after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice , and in obedient submission to circumstances , he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where . 
He knew that after his promise to Sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to Princess Mary . 
And he knew that he would never act basely . 
But he also knew -LRB- or rather felt at the bottom of his heart -RRB- that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him , he was not only doing nothing wrong , but was doing something very important -- more important than anything he had ever done in his life . 
After meeting Princess Mary , though the course of his life went on externally as before , all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her . 
But he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society , nor as he had for a long time , and at one time rapturously , thought about Sonya .
