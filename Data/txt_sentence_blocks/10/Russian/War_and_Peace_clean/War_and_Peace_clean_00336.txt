Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat , there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat , and so Kutuzov 's suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony . 
But Kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression , which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so . 
And , in fact , the last letter he had received from Mack 's army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable . 
`` Give me that letter , '' said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andrew . 
`` Please have a look at it '' -- and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage , in German , from the Archduke Ferdinand 's letter : We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech . 
Also , as we are masters of Ulm , we can not be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube , so that should the enemy not cross the Lech , we can cross the Danube , throw ourselves on his line of communications , recross the river lower down , and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally . 
We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped , and shall then , in conjunction with it , easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves . 
Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively . 
`` But you know the wise maxim your excellency , advising one to expect the worst , '' said the Austrian general , evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business . 
He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp .
