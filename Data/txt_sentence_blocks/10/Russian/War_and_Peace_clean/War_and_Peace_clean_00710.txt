`` But I have come to you , Prince , as a petitioner on behalf of this young man . 
You see ... '' but before Prince Andrew could finish , an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emperor . 
`` Oh , what a nuisance , '' said Dolgorukov , getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris . 
`` You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man . '' 
Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured , sincere , and animated levity . 
`` But you see ... another time ! '' 
Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment . 
He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny , obedient , and insignificant atom . 
They followed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corridor and met -- coming out of the door of the Emperor 's room by which Dolgorukov had entered -- a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which , without spoiling his face , gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression .
