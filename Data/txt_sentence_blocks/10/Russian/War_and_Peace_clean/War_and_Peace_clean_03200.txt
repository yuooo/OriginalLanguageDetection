But even if -- imagining a man quite exempt from all influences , examining only his momentary action in the present , unevoked by any cause -- we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero , we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man , for a being uninfluenced by the external world , standing outside of time and independent of cause , is no longer a man . 
In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated , that knowledge can never be complete , for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space . 
And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined , there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it , that period will be finite , while time is infinite , and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action , we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless , and so again we never reach absolute inevitability . 
But besides this , even if , admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero , we assumed in some given case -- as for instance in that of a dying man , an unborn babe , or an idiot -- complete absence of freedom , by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining , for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man . 
And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man 's completely free action . 
And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom , we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations , an infinitely long period of time , and an infinite series of causes . 
To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability , we must imagine him all alone , beyond space , beyond time , and free from dependence on cause .
