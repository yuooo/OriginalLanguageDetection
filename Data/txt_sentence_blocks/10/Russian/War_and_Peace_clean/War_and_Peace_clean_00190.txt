When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said , laughing and blushing : `` Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers . '' 
`` I am afraid of mixing the figures , '' Pierre replied ; `` but if you will be my teacher ... '' And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl . 
While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up , Pierre sat down with his little partner . 
Natasha was perfectly happy ; she was dancing with a grown-up man , who had been abroad . 
She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady . 
She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold . 
Assuming quite the pose of a society woman -LRB- heaven knows when and where she had learned it -RRB- she talked with her partner , fanning herself and smiling over the fan . 
`` Dear , dear ! 
Just look at her ! '' 
exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom , pointing to Natasha .
