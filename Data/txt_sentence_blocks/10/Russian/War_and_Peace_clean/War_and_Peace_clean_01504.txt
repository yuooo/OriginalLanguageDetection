It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him , he was living a real life , seeing new places and new people that interested him . 
The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt . 
Her letters to him , far from giving her any comfort , seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation . 
She could not write , because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice , smile , and glance . 
She wrote to him formal , monotonous , and dry letters , to which she attached no importance herself , and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling . 
There was still no improvement in the countess ' health , but it was impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer . 
Natasha 's trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold . 
Moreover , Prince Andrew was expected in Moscow , where old Prince Bolkonski was spending the winter , and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived . 
So the countess remained in the country , and the count , taking Sonya and Natasha with him , went to Moscow at the end of January . 
After Prince Andrews engagement to Natasha , Pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before .
