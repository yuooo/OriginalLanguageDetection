Prince Bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses . 
The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood , mustered the men who were woodcutting , and , allowing the French to pass him , had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French troops . 
`` When I saw , your excellency , that their first battalion was disorganized , I stopped in the road and thought : ` I 'll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion ' -- and that 's what I did . '' 
The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened . 
Perhaps it might really have been so ? 
Could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen ? 
`` By the way , your excellency , I should inform you , '' he continued - remembering Dolokhov 's conversation with Kutuzov and his last interview with the gentleman-ranker -- `` that Private Dolokhov , who was reduced to the ranks , took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself . '' 
`` I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there , your excellency , '' chimed in Zherkov , looking uneasily around . 
He had not seen the hussars all that day , but had heard about them from an infantry officer . 
`` They broke up two squares , your excellency . ''
