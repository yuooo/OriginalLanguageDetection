said Kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents , and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression . 
The priest 's wife , flushing rosy red , caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment , though she had so long been preparing for it , and with a low bow offered it to Kutuzov . 
He screwed up his eyes , smiled , lifted her chin with his hand , and said : `` Ah , what a beauty ! 
Thank you , sweetheart ! '' 
He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her . 
`` Well , my dear , and how are we getting on ? '' 
he asked , moving to the door of the room assigned to him . 
The priest 's wife smiled , and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room . 
The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him . 
Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kutuzov .
