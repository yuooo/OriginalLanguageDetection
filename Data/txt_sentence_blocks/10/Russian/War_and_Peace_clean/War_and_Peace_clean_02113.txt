`` I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting , but then I should n't lose anything ... '' Dolokhov was saying . 
`` Yes , yes . '' 
`` But if I were right , I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for which I am ready to die . '' 
`` Yes , yes . '' 
`` And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his skin , please think of me ... . 
Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene Highness . '' 
`` Yes ... Yes ... '' Kutuzov repeated , his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre . 
Just then Boris , with his courtierlike adroitness , stepped up to Pierre 's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner , without raising his voice , said to Pierre , as though continuing an interrupted conversation : `` The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die . 
What heroism , Count ! '' 
Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene Highness .
