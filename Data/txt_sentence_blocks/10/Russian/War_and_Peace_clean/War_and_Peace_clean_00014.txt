`` Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave - slafe with an f , as a village elder of mine writes in his reports . 
She is rich and of good family and that 's all I want . '' 
And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him , he raised the maid of honor 's hand to his lips , kissed it , and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair , looking in another direction . 
`` Attendez , '' said Anna Pavlovna , reflecting , `` I 'll speak to Lise , young Bolkonski 's wife , this very evening , and perhaps the thing can be arranged . 
It shall be on your family 's behalf that I 'll start my apprenticeship as old maid . '' 
Anna Pavlovna 's drawing room was gradually filling . 
The highest Petersburg society was assembled there : people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged . 
Prince Vasili 's daughter , the beautiful Helene , came to take her father to the ambassador 's entertainment ; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor . 
The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya , known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg , * was also there .
