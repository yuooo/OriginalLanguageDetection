he said , turning to an old man who was passing , but before he had finished his greeting there was a general stir , and a footman who had run in announced , with a frightened face : `` He 's arrived ! '' 
Bells rang , the stewards rushed forward , and -- like rye shaken together in a shovel -- the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom . 
Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword , which , in accord with the Club custom , he had given up to the hall porter . 
He had no lambskin cap on his head , nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder , as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz , but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders , and the Star of St. George on his left breast . 
Evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed , which changed his appearance for the worse . 
There was something naively festive in his air , which , in conjunction with his firm and virile features , gave him a rather comical expression . 
Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov , who had arrived with him , paused at the doorway to allow him , as the guest of honor , to enter first . 
Bagration was embarrassed , not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy , and this caused some delay at the doors , but after all he did at last enter first . 
He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room , not knowing what to do with his hands ; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire , as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern -- and he would have found that easier . 
The committeemen met him at the first door and , expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest , took possession of him as it were , without waiting for his reply , surrounded him , and led him to the drawing room .
