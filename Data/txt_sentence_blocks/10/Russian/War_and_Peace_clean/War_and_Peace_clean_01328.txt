`` Well , and very nice too ! 
I need nobody . '' 
A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him , and having closed the door behind him continued her walk . 
That morning she had returned to her favorite mood -- love of , and delight in , herself . 
`` How charming that Natasha is ! '' 
she said again , speaking as some third , collective , male person . 
`` Pretty , a good voice , young , and in nobody 's way if only they leave her in peace . '' 
But however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace , and immediately felt this . 
In the hall the porch door opened , and someone asked , `` At home ? '' 
and then footsteps were heard .
