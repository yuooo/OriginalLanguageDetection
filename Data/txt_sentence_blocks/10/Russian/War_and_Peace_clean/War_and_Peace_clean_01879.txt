Next day the Emperor left Moscow . 
The assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs , and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment , feeling amazed themselves at what they had done . 
Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to Dresden , could not help having his head turned by the homage he received , could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning , and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashev . 
Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted . 
Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way , because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander . 
Rostov charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field ; and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics , habits , circumstances , and aims . 
They were moved by fear or vanity , rejoiced or were indignant , reasoned , imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will , but they all were involuntary tools of history , carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us . 
Such is the inevitable fate of men of action , and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free . 
The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage , their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace , and nothing remains of that time but its historic results . 
Providence compelled all these men , striving to attain personal aims , to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected -- neither Napoleon , nor Alexander , nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting .
