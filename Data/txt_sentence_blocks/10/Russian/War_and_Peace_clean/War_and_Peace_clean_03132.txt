`` Ah , Nicholas , do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas , '' said Countess Mary . 
`` He is such an exceptional boy . 
I am afraid I neglect him in favor of my own : we all have children and relations while he has no one . 
He is constantly alone with his thoughts . '' 
`` Well , I do n't think you need reproach yourself on his account . 
All that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him , and of course I am glad of it . 
He is a fine lad , a fine lad ! 
This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance , and fancy -- as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits , and he told me of it himself at once ! 
I never knew him to tell an untruth . 
A fine lad , a fine lad ! ''
