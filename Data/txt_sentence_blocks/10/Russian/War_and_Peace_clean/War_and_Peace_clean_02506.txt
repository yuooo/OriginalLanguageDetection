When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket , she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor , jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front , and began replaiting it . 
Her long , thin , practiced fingers rapidly unplaited , replaited , and tied up her plait . 
Her head moved from side to side from habit , but her eyes , feverishly wide , looked fixedly before her . 
When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door . 
`` Natasha , you 'd better lie in the middle , '' said Sonya . 
`` I 'll stay here , '' muttered Natasha . 
`` Do lie down , '' she added crossly , and buried her face in the pillow . 
The countess , Madame Schoss , and Sonya undressed hastily and lay down . 
The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room . 
But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytishchi a mile and a half away , and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov 's Cossacks had set up across the street , and the adjutant 's unceasing moans could still be heard .
