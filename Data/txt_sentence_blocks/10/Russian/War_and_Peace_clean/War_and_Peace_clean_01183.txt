The whole forest was already clothed in green . 
It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe . 
Prince Andrew , depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the Marshal , was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the Rostovs ' house at Otradnoe . 
He heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche . 
Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired , remarkably slim , pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress , with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped . 
The girl was shouting something but , seeing that he was a stranger , ran back laughing without looking at him . 
Suddenly , he did not know why , he felt a pang . 
The day was so beautiful , the sun so bright , everything around so gay , but that slim pretty girl did not know , or wish to know , of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate -- probably foolish - but bright and happy life . 
`` What is she so glad about ? 
What is she thinking of ?
