`` And so you 've had him educated abroad , Prince Vasili , have n't you ? '' 
said the old prince to Prince Vasili . 
`` I have done my best for him , and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours . '' 
`` Yes , everything is different nowadays , everything is changed . 
The lad 's a fine fellow , a fine fellow ! 
Well , come with me now . '' 
He took Prince Vasili 's arm and led him to his study . 
As soon as they were alone together , Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince . 
`` Well , do you think I shall prevent her , that I ca n't part from her ? '' 
said the old prince angrily .
