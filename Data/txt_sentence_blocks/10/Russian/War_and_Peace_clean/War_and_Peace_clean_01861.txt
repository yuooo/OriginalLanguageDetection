Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts . 
All these conversations , especially the joking with the girls , were such as might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age , but they did not interest him now . 
He sat on his elevation -- the pedestal of the cannon -- still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him . 
The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed , together with that of rapture , still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion . 
Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment , to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks , and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing . 
Petya too would have run there , but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him . 
The firing was still proceeding when officers , generals , and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral , and after them others in a more leisurely manner : caps were again raised , and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again . 
At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors . 
`` Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! ''
