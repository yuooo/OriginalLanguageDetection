Prince Andrew was silent , but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face . 
`` One must be indulgent to little weaknesses ; who is free from them , Andrew ? 
Do n't forget that she has grown up and been educated in society , and so her position now is not a rosy one .

* Think it must be for her , poor thing , after what she has been used to , to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country , in her condition !
