`` Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov , '' he continued , `` we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape , or to trick us , now that we certainly have him in our hands ! 
No , we must n't forget Suvorov and his rule -- not to put yourself in a position to be attacked , but yourself to attack . 
Believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old Cunctators . '' 
`` But in what position are we going to attack him ? 
I have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated , '' said Prince Andrew . 
He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself formed . 
`` Oh , that is all the same , '' Dolgorukov said quickly , and getting up he spread a map on the table . 
`` All eventualities have been foreseen . 
If he is standing before Brunn ... '' And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother 's plan of a flanking movement . 
Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan , which might have been as good as Weyrother 's , but for the disadvantage that Weyrother 's had already been approved .
