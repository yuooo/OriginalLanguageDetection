`` It has , Your Majesty . '' 
Napoleon nodded and walked away . 
At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevardino . 
It was growing light , the sky was clearing , only a single cloud lay in the east . 
The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light . 
On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence . 
Some minutes passed . 
A second and a third report shook the air , then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right . 
The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another . 
Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevardino Redoubt where he dismounted .
