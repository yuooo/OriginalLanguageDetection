Bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief . 
On that bright evening of August 25 , Prince Andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the further end of his regiment 's encampment . 
Through a gap in the broken wall he could see , beside the wooden fence , a row of thirty year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off , a field on which shocks of oats were standing , and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires -- the soldiers ' kitchens . 
Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him , Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz . 
He had received and given the orders for next day 's battle and had nothing more to do . 
But his thoughts -- the simplest , clearest , and therefore most terrible thoughts -- would give him no peace . 
He knew that tomorrow 's battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in , and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him -- not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others , but simply in relation to himself , to his own soul -- vividly , plainly , terribly , and almost as a certainty . 
And from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows , without perspective , without distinction of outline . 
All life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass . 
Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass .
