`` Of course it is , '' he answered absently . 
`` That 's not the point . 
I beg you not to indulge in trifles now , but to help to pack , and tomorrow we must go , go , go ! 
... '' And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants . 
At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had heard . 
He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin , and that though Rostopchin 's broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance , the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow , and that there would be a big battle there . 
The countess looked with timid horror at her son 's eager , excited face as he said this . 
She realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle -LRB- she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement -RRB- he would say something about men , honor , and the fatherland -- something senseless , masculine , and obstinate which there would be no contradicting , and her plans would be spoiled ; and so , hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her as their protector and defender , she did not answer him , but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly , that very night if possible . 
With a woman 's involuntary loving cunning she , who till then had not shown any alarm , said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night . 
Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything .
