At dinner , conversation turned on Pierre 's marriage . 
`` I was very much surprised when I heard of it , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre blushed , as he always did when it was mentioned , and said hurriedly : `` I will tell you some time how it all happened . 
But you know it is all over , and forever . '' 
`` Forever ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Nothing 's forever . '' 
`` But you know how it all ended , do n't you ? 
You heard of the duel ? '' 
`` And so you had to go through that too ! ''
