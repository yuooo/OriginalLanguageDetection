The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezukhova . 
She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously , had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament , and was said to be receiving no one , and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way . 
They all knew very well that the enchanting countess ' illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time , and that the Italian 's cure consisted in removing such inconvenience ; but in Anna Pavlovna 's presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it . 
`` They say the poor countess is very ill . 
The doctor says it is angina pectoris . '' 
`` Angina ? 
Oh , that 's a terrible illness ! '' 
`` They say that the rivals are reconciled , thanks to the angina ... '' and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction . 
`` The count is pathetic , they say . 
He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous . ''
