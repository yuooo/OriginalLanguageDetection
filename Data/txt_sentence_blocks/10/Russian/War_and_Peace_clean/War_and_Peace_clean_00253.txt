I have had a letter from my brother , who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife . 
This pleasure will be but a brief one , however , for he will leave , us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn , God knows how or why . 
Not only where you are -- at the heart of affairs and of the world -- is the talk all of war , even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature -- which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country -- rumors of war are heard and painfully felt . 
My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches , things of which I understand nothing ; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene ... . 
It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army . 
You should have seen the state of the mothers , wives , and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs . 
It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour , Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries -- and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another . 
Adieu , dear and kind friend ; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care ! 
MARY `` Ah , you are sending off a letter , Princess ? 
I have already dispatched mine .
