Since he had begun to move in the highest circles Boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down . 
At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore , and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages . 
At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch , and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out . 
The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes . 
He noted this down that same evening , among other facts he felt to be of historic importance . 
As the Emperor 's suite was a very small one , it was a matter of great importance , for a man who valued his success in the service , to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors , and having succeeded in this , Boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured . 
He had not only become known , but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him . 
Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself , so that the latter knew his face , and all those at court , far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer , would now have been surprised had he been absent . 
Boris lodged with another adjutant , the Polish Count Zhilinski . 
Zhilinski , a Pole brought up in Paris , was rich , and passionately fond of the French , and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit , French officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and Boris .
