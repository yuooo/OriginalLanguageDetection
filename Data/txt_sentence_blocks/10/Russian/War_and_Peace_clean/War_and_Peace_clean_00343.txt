`` Your excellency , '' said he in German , stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general , `` I have the honor to congratulate you . '' 
He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other , awkwardly , like a child at a dancing lesson . 
The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but , seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile , could not but give him a moment 's attention . 
He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening . 
`` I have the honor to congratulate you . 
General Mack has arrived , quite well , only a little bruised just here , '' he added , pointing with a beaming smile to his head . 
The general frowned , turned away , and went on . 
`` Gott , wie naiv ! '' 
* said he angrily , after he had gone a few steps . 
* `` Good God , what simplicity ! ''
