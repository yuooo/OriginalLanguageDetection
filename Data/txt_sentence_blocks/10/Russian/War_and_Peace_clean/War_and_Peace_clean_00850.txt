We 'll all have breakfast together . '' 
And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe , like a ballet dancer , but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile . 
When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room , he reddened . 
He did not know how to behave with her . 
The evening before , in the first happy moment of meeting , they had kissed each other , but today they felt it could not be done ; he felt that everybody , including his mother and sisters , was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her . 
He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you - Sonya . 
But their eyes met and said thou , and exchanged tender kisses . 
Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared , by Natasha 's intermediacy , to remind him of his promise , and then thanked him for his love . 
His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her , for that would be impossible . 
`` How strange it is , '' said Vera , selecting a moment when all were silent , `` that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers . ''
