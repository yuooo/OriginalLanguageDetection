But examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people , we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events . 
The incontestable proof of this deduction is that , however many commands were issued , the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it , but as soon as an event occurs -- be it what it may -- then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events . 
Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history : -LRB- 1 -RRB- What is power ? 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- What force produces the movement of the nations ? 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals , in which the more this person expresses opinions , predictions , and justifications of the collective action that is performed , the less is his participation in that action . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- The movement of nations is caused not by power , nor by intellectual activity , nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed , but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events , and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa . 
Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event ; physically it is those who submit to the power . 
But as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical , the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two . 
Or in other words , the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining . 
In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity -- that final limit to which in every domain of thought man 's reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject .
