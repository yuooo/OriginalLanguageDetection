`` Not ` very good ' it 's simply delicious ! '' 
Just as `` Uncle 's '' pickled mushrooms , honey , and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world , so also that song , at that moment , seemed to her the acme of musical delight . 
`` More , please , more ! '' 
cried Natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka ceased . 
Mitka tuned up afresh , and recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of My Lady , with trills and variations . 
`` Uncle '' sat listening , slightly smiling , with his head on one side . 
The air was repeated a hundred times . 
The balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again , but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again . 
Anisya Fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost . 
`` You like listening ? ''
