A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there , for fear of compromising her and committing himself , would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance . 
That winter the Karagins ' house was the most agreeable and hospitable in Moscow . 
In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties , a large company , chiefly of men , gathered there every day , supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning . 
Julie never missed a ball , a promenade , or a play . 
Her dresses were always of the latest fashion . 
But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love , or any of the joys of life , and expected peace only `` yonder . '' 
She adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment , like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him . 
Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light , and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life . 
This melancholy , which did not prevent her amusing herself , did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly . 
Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess , and then amused himself with society gossip , dancing , intellectual games , and bouts rimes , which were in vogue at the Karagins ' .
