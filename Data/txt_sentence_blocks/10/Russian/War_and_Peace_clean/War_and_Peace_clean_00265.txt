Prince Andrew smiled . 
`` Give me time to collect my wits , Father , '' said he , with a smile that showed that his father 's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him . 
`` Why , I have not yet had time to settle down ! '' 
`` Nonsense , nonsense ! '' 
cried the old man , shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited , and grasping his by the hand . 
`` The house for your wife is ready . 
Princess Mary will take her there and show her over , and they 'll talk nineteen to the dozen . 
That 's their woman 's way ! 
I am glad to have her . 
Sit down and talk .
