It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all , but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible . 
He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business , careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young lady . 
The old count , who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son 's care , being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September , prepared to go out with the others . 
In an hour 's time the whole hunting party was at the porch . 
Nicholas , with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles , went past Natasha and Petya who were trying to tell him something . 
He had a look at all the details of the hunt , sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry , mounted his chestnut Donets , and whistling to his own leash of borzois , set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otradnoe wood . 
The old count 's horse , a sorrel gelding called Viflyanka , was led by the groom in attendance on him , while the count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him . 
They were taking fifty-four hounds , with six hunt attendants and whippers-in . 
Besides the family , there were eight borzoi kennelmen and more than forty borzois , so that , with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family , there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen . 
Each dog knew its master and its call .
