The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him , tried to ingratiate themselves with him , and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it . 
A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened , at which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order . 
The meeting was a full one . 
After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began his address . 
`` Dear Brothers , '' he began , blushing and stammering , with a written speech in his hand , `` it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge -- we must act -- act ! 
We are drowsing , but we must act . '' 
Pierre raised his notebook and began to read . 
`` For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue , '' he read , `` we must cleanse men from prejudice , diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times , undertake the education of the young , unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men , boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions , infidelity , and folly , and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power . 
`` To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may , even in this world , receive a lasting reward for his virtue . 
But in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today .
