The whole household , servants included , was bright and animated . 
Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time . 
`` What could we fasten this onto ? '' 
asked the servants , trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage . 
`` We must keep at least one cart . '' 
`` What 's in it ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` The count 's books . '' 
`` Leave it , Vasilich will put it away . 
It 's not wanted . ''
