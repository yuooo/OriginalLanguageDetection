The valet 's sleepy , frightened exclamation , `` What do you want ? 
What 's the matter ? '' 
made Natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner . 
Horribly unlike a man as that body looked , she must see him . 
She passed the valet , the snuff fell from the candle wick , and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt , and such as she had always seen him . 
He was the same as ever , but the feverish color of his face , his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her , and especially his neck , delicate as a child 's , revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt , gave him a peculiarly innocent , childlike look , such as she had never seen on him before . 
She went up to him and with a swift , flexible , youthful movement dropped on her knees . 
He smiled and held out his hand to her . 
Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodino . 
His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels , which were injured , were in the doctor 's opinion sure to carry him off .
