The officer in the scarf dismounted , called up a drummer , and went with him into the arcade . 
Some soldiers started running away in a group . 
A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose , and a calm , persistent , calculating expression on his plump face , hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer , swinging his arms . 
`` Your honor ! '' 
said he . 
`` Be so good as to protect us ! 
We wo n't grudge trifles , you are welcome to anything -- we shall be delighted ! 
Pray ! 
... I 'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman , or even two pieces with pleasure . 
For we feel how it is ; but what 's all this -- sheer robbery !
