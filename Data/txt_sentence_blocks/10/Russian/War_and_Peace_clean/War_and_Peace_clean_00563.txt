Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously . 
`` Your excellency ! '' 
Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice , '' you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin 's battery . 
I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out , two guns smashed , and no supports at all . '' 
Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at Bolkonski , who spoke with suppressed agitation . 
`` And , if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion , '' he continued , `` we owe today 's success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company , '' and without awaiting a reply , Prince Andrew rose and left the table . 
Prince Bagration looked at Tushin , evidently reluctant to show distrust in Bolkonski 's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it , bent his head , and told Tushin that he could go . 
Prince Andrew went out with him . 
`` Thank you ; you saved me , my dear fellow ! '' 
said Tushin .
