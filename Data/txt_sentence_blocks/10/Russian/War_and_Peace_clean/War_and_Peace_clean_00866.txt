It was at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration over each other 's shoulders , as if he were some rare animal . 
Count Ilya Rostov , laughing and repeating the words , `` Make way , dear boy ! 
Make way , make way ! '' 
pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone , led the guests into the drawing room , and seated them on the center sofa . 
The bigwigs , the most respected members of the Club , beset the new arrivals . 
Count Ilya , again thrusting his way through the crowd , went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman , carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagration . 
On the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero 's honor . 
Bagration , on seeing the salver , glanced around in dismay , as though seeking help . 
But all eyes demanded that he should submit . 
Feeling himself in their power , he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him .
