Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third . 
`` Oh , women , women ! '' 
and the captain , looking with glistening eyes at Pierre , began talking of love and of his love affairs . 
There were very many of these , as one could easily believe , looking at the officer 's handsome , self-satisfied face , and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women . 
Though all Ramballe 's love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love , yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity . 
It was plain that l'amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife , nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Natasha . 
-LRB- Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally : the one he considered the `` love of clodhoppers '' and the other the `` love of simpletons . '' -RRB- 
L'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling . 
Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming , innocent child of seventeen , daughter of the bewitching marquise . 
The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter , ending in the mother 's sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover , even now agitated the captain , though it was the memory of a distant past .
