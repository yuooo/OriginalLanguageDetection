said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent , looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door . 
`` The commander in chief is engaged , '' said Kozlovski , going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door . 
`` Whom shall I announce ? '' 
The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski , who was rather short , as if surprised that anyone should not know him . 
`` The commander in chief is engaged , '' repeated Kozlovski calmly . 
The general 's face clouded , his lips quivered and trembled . 
He took out a notebook , hurriedly scribbled something in pencil , tore out the leaf , gave it to Kozlovski , stepped quickly to the window , and threw himself into a chair , gazing at those in the room as if asking , `` Why do they look at me ? '' 
Then he lifted his head , stretched his neck as if he intended to say something , but immediately , with affected indifference , began to hum to himself , producing a queer sound which immediately broke off . 
The door of the private room opened and Kutuzov appeared in the doorway . 
The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger , and , making long , quick strides with his thin legs , went up to Kutuzov .
