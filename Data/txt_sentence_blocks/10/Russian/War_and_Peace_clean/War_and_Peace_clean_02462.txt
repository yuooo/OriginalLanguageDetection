`` It 's them ! 
Gracious heavens ! 
O Lord , four of them , horsemen ! '' 
she cried . 
Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go , and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard . 
Pierre , having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French , stood at the half-open door of the corridor , intending to conceal himself as soon as the French entered . 
But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire -- an irresistible curiosity kept him there . 
There were two of them . 
One was an officer -- a tall , soldierly , handsome man -- the other evidently a private or an orderly , sunburned , short , and thin , with sunken cheeks and a dull expression .
