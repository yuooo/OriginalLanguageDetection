It wo n't be long now before I am off duty . 
I 'll take another turn and when I get back I 'll go to the general and ask him . '' 
He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars . 
It seemed to him that it was getting lighter . 
To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up , and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall . 
On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostov could not at all make out : was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon , or some unmelted snow , or some white houses ? 
He even thought something moved on that white spot . 
`` I expect it 's snow ... that spot ... a spot -- une tache , '' he thought . 
`` There now ... it 's not a tache ... Natasha ... sister , black eyes ... Na ... tasha ... -LRB- Wo n't she be surprised when I tell her how I 've seen the Emperor ? -RRB- 
Natasha ... take my sabretache ... '' -- `` Keep to the right , your honor , there are bushes here , '' came the voice of an hussar , past whom Rostov was riding in the act of falling asleep .
