Rostopchin went again to the balcony door . 
`` But what do they want ? '' 
he asked the superintendent of police . 
`` Your excellency , they say they have got ready , according to your orders , to go against the French , and they shouted something about treachery . 
But it is a turbulent crowd , your excellency -- I hardly managed to get away from it .

I do n't need you to tell me what to do ! '' 
exclaimed Rostopchin angrily . 
He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd .
