A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it . 
The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again . 
One was shouting , `` Get on ! 
Why are you hindering us ? '' 
Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air ; a third was striking the horse Kutuzov himself rode . 
Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men , Kutuzov , with his suite diminished by more than half , rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by . 
Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives , Prince Andrew , trying to keep near Kutuzov , saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it . 
Higher up stood some Russian infantry , neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd . 
A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutuzov . 
Of Kutuzov 's suite only four remained .
