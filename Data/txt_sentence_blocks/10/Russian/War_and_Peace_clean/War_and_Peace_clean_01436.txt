She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar . 
She asked `` Uncle '' for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song . 
After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men , who had been sent to look for them , arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya .

Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps . 
Natasha and Nicholas got into the other .

In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke .
