he added . 
`` Only tell me where to go and where to shoot , '' he said with an unnaturally gentle smile . 
He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger , as he had not before held a pistol in his hand -- a fact that he did not to confess . 
`` Oh yes , like that , I know , I only forgot , '' said he . 
`` No apologies , none whatever , '' said Dolokhov to Denisov -LRB- who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation -RRB- , and he also went up to the appointed place . 
The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road , where the sleighs had been left , in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow , the frost having begun to break up during the last few days . 
The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing . 
The seconds , measuring the paces , left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvitski 's and Dolokhov 's sabers , which were stuck intothe ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier . 
It was thawing and misty ; at forty paces ' distance nothing could be seen .
