Several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes . 
The shutters were all closed , except at one window which was open . 
A little serf boy , seeing Prince Andrew , ran into the house . 
Alpatych , having sent his family away , was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints . 
On hearing that Prince Andrew had come , he went out with his spectacles on his nose , buttoning his coat , and , hastily stepping up , without a word began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew 's knee . 
Then , vexed at his own weakness , he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs . 
Everything precious and valuable had been removed to Bogucharovo . 
Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away . 
The hay and the spring corn , of which Alpatych said there had been a remarkable crop that year , had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green . 
The peasants were ruined ; some of them too had gone to Bogucharovo , only a few remained .
