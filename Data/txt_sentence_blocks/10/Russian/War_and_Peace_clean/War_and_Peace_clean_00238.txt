After her talk with Pierre , Anna Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs ' and went to bed . 
On waking in the morning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezukhov 's death . 
She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die , that his end was not only touching but edifying . 
As to the last meeting between father and son , it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears , and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments -- the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son , or Pierre , whom it had been pitiful to see , so stricken was he with grief , though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father . 
`` It is painful , but it does one good . 
It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son , '' said she . 
Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly , but in whispers and as a great secret . 
At Bald Hills , Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski 's estate , the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected , but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince 's household . 
General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich -LRB- nicknamed in society , `` the King of Prussia '' -RRB- ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter , Princess Mary , and her companion , Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals , he still continued to live in the country , remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills , while he himself needed no one and nothing .
