`` Listen , Bilibin , '' said Helene -LRB- she always called friends of that sort by their surnames -RRB- , and she touched his coat sleeve with her white , beringed fingers . 
`` Tell me , as you would a sister , what I ought to do . 
Which of the two ? '' 
Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered , with a smile on his lips . 
`` You are not taking me unawares , you know , '' said he . 
`` As a true friend , I have thought and thought again about your affair . 
You see , if you marry the prince '' -- he meant the younger man -- and he crooked one finger , `` you forever lose the chance of marrying the other , and you will displease the court besides . 
-LRB- You know there is some kind of connection . -RRB- 
But if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy , and as widow of the Grand ... the prince would no longer be making a mesalliance by marrying you , '' and Bilibin smoothed out his forehead . 
`` That 's a true friend ! ''
