The postilion and all the other servants did the same . 
`` Off , in God 's name ! '' 
said Efim , putting on his hat . 
`` Start ! '' 
The postilion started the horses , the off pole horse tugged at his collar , the high springs creaked , and the body of the coach swayed . 
The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway ; the other vehicles jolted in their turn , and the procession of carriages moved up the street . 
In the carriages , the caleche , and the phaeton , all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house . 
Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off . 
Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now , sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken , agitated Moscow . 
Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them .
