`` Any police officer would have done as much ! 
If we had had only peasants to fight , we should not have let the enemy come so far , '' said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject . 
`` I am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance . 
Good-by , Princess . 
I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances . 
If you do n't want to make me blush , please do n't thank me ! '' 
But the princess , if she did not again thank him in words , thanked him with the whole expression of her face , radiant with gratitude and tenderness . 
She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for . 
On the contrary , it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French , and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her , and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul , able to understand her position and her sorrow . 
His kind , honest eyes , with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss , did leave her memory .
