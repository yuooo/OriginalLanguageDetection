Natasha blushed and laughed . 
`` Well , really , Mamma ! 
Why should you ? 
What is there to be surprised at ? '' 
In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors . 
They now , stretching themselves after sitting so long , and replacing their purses and pocketbooks , entered the ballroom . 
First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count , both with merry countenances . 
The count , with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style , offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna . 
He drew himself up , a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended , he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery , addressing the first violin : `` Semen ! 
Do you know the Daniel Cooper ? ''
