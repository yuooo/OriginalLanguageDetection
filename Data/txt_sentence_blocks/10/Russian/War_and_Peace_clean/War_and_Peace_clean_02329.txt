`` Why , it 's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases , '' said the butler 's assistant . 
`` Oh , wait , please ! ''

`` These are n't needed , '' said she , putting aside some plates of Kiev ware . 
`` These -- yes , these must go among the carpets , '' she said , referring to the Saxony china dishes . 
`` Do n't , Natasha ! 
Leave it alone ! 
We 'll get it all packed , '' urged Sonya reproachfully . 
`` What a young lady she is ! ''
