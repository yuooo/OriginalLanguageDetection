After them other couples followed , filling the whole dining hall , and last of all the children , tutors , and governesses followed singly . 
The footmen began moving about , chairs scraped , the band struck up in the gallery , and the guests settled down in their places . 
Then the strains of the count 's household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks , the voices of visitors , and the soft steps of the footmen . 
At one end of the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left , the other lady visitors were farther down . 
At the other end sat the count , with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right . 
Midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people : Vera beside Berg , and Pierre beside Boris ; and on the other side , the children , tutors , and governesses . 
From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons , and busily filled his neighbors ' glasses , not neglecting his own . 
The countess in turn , without omitting her duties as hostess , threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair . 
At the ladies ' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time , at the men 's end the voices sounded louder and louder , especially that of the colonel of hussars who , growing more and more flushed , ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests . 
Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling .
