Just look ! '' 
`` Only not for this ... '' Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh , and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse . 
As in every large household , there were at Bald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole , though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others . 
Every event , joyful or sad , that took place in that house was important to all these worlds , but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others . 
For instance , Pierre 's return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so . 
The servants -- the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life -- were glad of Pierre 's return because they knew that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate , and would be in better spirits and temper , and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays . 
The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre 's return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did . 
He alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise -LRB- his only piece -RRB- to which , as he said , all possible dances could be danced , and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all . 
Young Nicholas , now a slim lad of fifteen , delicate and intelligent , with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes , was delighted because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection . 
No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally .
