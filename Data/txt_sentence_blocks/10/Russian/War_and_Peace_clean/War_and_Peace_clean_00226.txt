Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count 's face stirred . 
Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next . 
Anna Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed . 
Pierre obediently sat down , his eyes asking if he were doing right . 
Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly . 
Again Pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue , evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible . 
He looked at the count , who still gazed at the spot where Pierre 's face had been before he sat down . 
Anna Mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son . 
This lasted about two minutes , which to Pierre seemed an hour . 
Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count 's face began to twitch .
