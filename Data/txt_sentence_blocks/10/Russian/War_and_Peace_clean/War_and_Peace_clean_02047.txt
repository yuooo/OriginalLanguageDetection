`` I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer , '' said Denisov , `` that I can bweak Napoleon 's line of communication ! '' 
`` What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich Denisov ? '' 
asked Kutuzov , interrupting him . 
`` He is my uncle , your Sewene Highness . '' 
`` Ah , we were friends , '' said Kutuzov cheerfully . 
`` All right , all right , friend , stay here at the staff and tomorrow we 'll have a talk . '' 
With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers Konovnitsyn had brought him . 
`` Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside ? '' 
said the general on duty in a discontented voice , `` the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed . '' 
An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within .
