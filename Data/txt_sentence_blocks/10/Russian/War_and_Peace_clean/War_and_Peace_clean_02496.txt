The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi , fourteen miles from Moscow . 
They had started so late on the first of September , the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops , so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back , that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow . 
The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytishchi . 
At ten o'clock that evening the Rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village . 
The Rostovs ' servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers , after attending to their masters , had supper , fed the horses , and came out into the porches . 
In a neighboring hut lay Raevski 's adjutant with a fractured wrist . 
The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously , and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night . 
He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostovs . 
The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning , and at Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man . 
In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed , above the high body of a coach standing before the porch , the small glow of another fire .
