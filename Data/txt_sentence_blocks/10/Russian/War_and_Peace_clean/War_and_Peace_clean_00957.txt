Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him , which he had reckoned up to ten thousand , but that now , as he vaguely supposed , must have risen to fifteen thousand . 
In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles . 
Dolokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them , but followed every movement of Rostov 's hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him . 
He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand . 
He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and Sonya 's joint ages . 
Rostov , leaning his head on both hands , sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures , wet with spilled wine , and littered with cards . 
One tormenting impression did not leave him : that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves , those hands which he loved and hated , held him in their power . 
`` Six hundred rubles , ace , a corner , a nine ... winning it back 's impossible ... Oh , how pleasant it was at home ! 
... The knave , double or quits ... it ca n't be ! 
... And why is he doing this to me ? ''
