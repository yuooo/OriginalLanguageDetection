Some historians say that Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards , who were intact , and the battle would have been won . 
To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring . 
It could not be . 
Napoleon did not give his Guards , not because he did not want to , but because it could not be done . 
All the generals , officers , and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done , because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it . 
It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless , but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not , after all their experience of previous battles -- when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled -- experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who , after losing HALF his men , stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle . 
The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted . 
Not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks , called standards , and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing , but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodino . 
The French invaders , like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound , felt that they were perishing , but could not stop , any more than the Russian army , weaker by one half , could help swerving . 
By impetus gained , the French army was still able to roll forward to Moscow , but there , without further effort on the part of the Russians , it had to perish , bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodino .
