The troops were moving on , leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them . 
There were wounded in the yards , at the windows of the houses , and the streets were crowded with them . 
In the streets , around carts that were to take some of the wounded away , shouts , curses , and blows could be heard . 
Pierre offered the use of his carriage , which had overtaken him , to a wounded general he knew , and drove with him to Moscow . 
On the way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew . 
On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow . 
Close to the gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchin 's adjutant . 
`` We have been looking for you everywhere , '' said the adjutant . 
`` The count wants to see you particularly . 
He asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter . ''
