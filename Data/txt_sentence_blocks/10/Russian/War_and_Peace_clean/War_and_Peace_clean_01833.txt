She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins , and especially of her own sins , and she prayed to God to forgive them all , and her too , and to give them all , and her too , peace and happiness . 
And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer . 
From the day when Pierre , after leaving the Rostovs ' with Natasha 's grateful look fresh in his mind , had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon -- from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things , that had incessantly tormented him , no longer presented itself . 
That terrible question `` Why ? '' 
`` Wherefore ? '' 
which had come to him amid every occupation , was now replaced , not by another question or by a reply to the former question , but by her image . 
When he listened to , or himself took part in , trivial conversations , when he read or heard of human baseness or folly , he was not horrified as formerly , and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible -- but he remembered her as he had last seen her , and all his doubts vanished -- not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him , but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another , a brighter , realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty -- a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for . 
Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him , he said to himself : `` Well , supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar , and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon him , what does that matter ? 
She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again , and I love her , and no one will ever know it . '' 
And his soul felt calm and peaceful .
