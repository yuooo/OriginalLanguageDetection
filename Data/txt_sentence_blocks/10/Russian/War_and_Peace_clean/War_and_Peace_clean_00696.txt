Stopping in front of the Pavlograds , the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled . 
Seeing that smile , Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign . 
He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry . 
The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him . 
`` Oh God , what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me ? '' 
thought Rostov . 
`` I should die of happiness ! '' 
The Tsar addressed the officers also : `` I thank you all , gentlemen , I thank you with my whole heart . '' 
To Rostov every word sounded like a voice from heaven . 
How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar !
