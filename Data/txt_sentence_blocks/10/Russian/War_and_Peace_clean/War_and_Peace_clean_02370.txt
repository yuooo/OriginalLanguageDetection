Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something , but the countess interrupted him . 
`` You were at the battle , we heard . '' 
`` Yes , I was , '' Pierre answered . 
`` There will be another battle tomorrow ... '' he began , but Natasha interrupted him . 
`` But what is the matter with you , Count ? 
You are not like yourself ... '' `` Oh , do n't ask me , do n't ask me ! 
I do n't know myself . 
Tomorrow ... But no ! 
Good-by , good-by ! '' 
he muttered .
