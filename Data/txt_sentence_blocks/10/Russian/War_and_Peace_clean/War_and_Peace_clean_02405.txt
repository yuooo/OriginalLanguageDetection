In the midst of the song cries were heard , and fighting and blows in the passage and porch . 
The tall lad waved his arm . 
`` Stop it ! '' 
he exclaimed peremptorily . 
`` There 's a fight , lads ! '' 
And , still rolling up his sleeve , he went out to the porch . 
The factory hands followed him . 
These men , who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning , had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them . 
The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy , hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into , wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted . 
The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door , and when the workmen came out the smith , wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper , fell face downward on the pavement .
