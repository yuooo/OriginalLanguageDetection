After him the stout Nesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight . 
`` How 's this , Colonel ? '' 
he shouted as he approached . 
`` I told you to fire the bridge , and now someone has gone and blundered ; they are all beside themselves over there and one ca n't make anything out . '' 
The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvitski . 
`` You spoke to me of inflammable material , '' said he , `` but you said nothing about firing it . '' 
`` But , my dear sir , '' said Nesvitski as he drew up , taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand , `` was n't I telling you to fire the bridge , when inflammable material had been put in position ? '' 
`` I am not your ` dear sir , ' Mr. Staff Officer , and you did not tell me to burn the bridge ! 
I know the service , and it is my habit orders strictly to obey . 
You said the bridge would be burned , but who would it burn , I could not know by the holy spirit ! ''
