Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat , lit up by the fire , was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod . 
`` Oh , he 's a hard nut to crack , '' said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire . 
`` He 'll make them get a move on , those fellows ! '' 
said another , laughing . 
Both fell silent , peering out through the darkness at the sound of Dolokhov 's and Petya 's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses . 
`` Bonjour , messieurs ! '' 
* said Dolokhov loudly and clearly . 
* `` Good day , gentlemen . '' 
There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire , and one tall , long-necked officer , walking round the fire , came up to Dolokhov . 
`` Is that you , Clement ? ''
