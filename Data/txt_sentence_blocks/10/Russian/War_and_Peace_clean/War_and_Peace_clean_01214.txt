To make quite sure of the firmness the ground , he put his other foot down and sank deeper still , became stuck in it , and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog . 
Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg -- he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges , and lived almost entirely in Moscow . 
All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary life , and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D. , whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men . 
Under the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life . 
Often after collecting alms , and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members , of whom half were as well able to pay as himself , Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor , and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul . 
He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories . 
In the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs , but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order : with questions of the threefold designation of God , the three primordial elements -- sulphur , mercury , and salt -- or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon . 
Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged , including , Pierre thought , Joseph Alexeevich himself , but he did not share their interests . 
His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry . 
In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him , seeking and vacillating , who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path , but hoped to do so .
