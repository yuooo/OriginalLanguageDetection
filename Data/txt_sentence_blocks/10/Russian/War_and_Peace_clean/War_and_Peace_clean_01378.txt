`` We are going , but only wolf hunting : it would be dull for you . '' 
`` You know it is my greatest pleasure , '' said Natasha . 
`` It 's not fair ; you are going by yourself , are having the horses saddled and said nothing to us about it . '' '' 
` No barrier bars a Russian 's path ' -- we 'll go ! '' 
shouted Petya . 
`` But you ca n't . 
Mamma said you must n't , '' said Nicholas to Natasha . 
`` Yes , I 'll go . 
I shall certainly go , '' said Natasha decisively . 
`` Daniel , tell them to saddle for us , and Michael must come with my dogs , '' she added to the huntsman .
