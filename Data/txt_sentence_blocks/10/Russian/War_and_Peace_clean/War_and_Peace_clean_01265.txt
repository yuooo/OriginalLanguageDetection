`` You wo n't do it right . '' 
`` But it 's already ten . '' 
They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten , and Natasha had still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens . 
When her hair was done , Natasha , in her short petticoat from under which her dancing shoes showed , and in her mother 's dressing jacket , ran up to Sonya , scrutinized her , and then ran to her mother . 
Turning her mother 's head this way and that , she fastened on the cap and , hurriedly kissing her gray hair , ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt . 
The cause of the delay was Natasha 's skirt , which was too long . 
Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread . 
A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and Sonya , and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand . 
`` Mavra , quicker , darling ! '' 
`` Give me my thimble , Miss , from there ... '' `` Whenever will you be ready ? ''
