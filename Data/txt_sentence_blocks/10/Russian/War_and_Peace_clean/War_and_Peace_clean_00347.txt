Another hussar also rushed toward the horse , but Bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse 's head . 
It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him . 
Rostov patted the horse 's neck and then his flank , and lingered for a moment . 
`` Splendid ! 
What a horse he will be ! '' 
he thought with a smile , and holding up his saber , his spurs jingling , he ran up the steps of the porch . 
His landlord , who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap , pitchfork in hand , was clearing manure from the cowhouse , looked out , and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rostov . 
`` Schon gut Morgen ! 
Schon gut Morgen ! ''
