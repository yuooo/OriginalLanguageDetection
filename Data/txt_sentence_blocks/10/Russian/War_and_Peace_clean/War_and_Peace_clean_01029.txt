`` In our temples we recognize no other distinctions , '' read the Grand Master , `` but those between virtue and vice . 
Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality . 
Fly to a brother 's aid whoever he may be , exhort him who goeth astray , raise him that falleth , never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother . 
Be kindly and courteous . 
Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue . 
Share thy happiness with thy neighbor , and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss . 
Forgive thy enemy , do not avenge thyself except by doing him good . 
Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost . '' 
He finished and , getting up , embraced and kissed Pierre , who , with tears of joy in his eyes , looked round him , not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides . 
He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers , and burned with impatience to set to work with them .
