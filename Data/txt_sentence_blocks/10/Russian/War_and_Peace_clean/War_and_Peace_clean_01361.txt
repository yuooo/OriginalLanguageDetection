In 1810 he received letters from his parents , in which they told him of Natasha 's engagement to Bolkonski , and that the wedding would be in a year 's time because the old prince made difficulties . 
This letter grieved and mortified Nicholas . 
In the first place he was sorry that Natasha , for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family , should be lost to the home ; and secondly , from his hussar point of view , he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after all , and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father . 
For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married , but then came the maneuvers , and considerations about Sonya and about the confusion of their affairs , and Nicholas again put it off . 
But in the spring of that year , he received a letter from his mother , written without his father 's knowledge , and that letter persuaded him to return . 
She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand , their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging . 
The count was so weak , and trusted Mitenka so much , and was so good-natured , that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse . 
`` For God 's sake , I implore you , come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched , '' wrote the countess . 
This letter touched Nicholas . 
He had that common sense of a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do .
