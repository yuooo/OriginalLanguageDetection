The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals , gentlemen-in-waiting , and Polish magnates -- several of whom Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia -- were waiting . 
Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride . 
After some minutes , the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and , bowing politely , asked Balashev to follow him . 
Balashev went into a small reception room , one door of which led into a study , the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission . 
He stood a minute or two , waiting . 
He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door , both halves of it were opened rapidly ; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps , firm and resolute -- they were those of Napoleon . 
He had just finished dressing for his ride , and wore a blue uniform , opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach , white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs , and Hessian boots . 
His short hair had evidently just been brushed , but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead . 
His plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform , and he smelled of Eau de Cologne . 
His full face , rather young-looking , with its prominent chin , wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome .
