Can I do anything for you ? 
Dispose of me . 
It is for life and death . 
I say it with my hand on my heart ! '' 
said he , striking his chest . 
`` Thank you , '' said Pierre . 
The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that `` shelter '' was Unterkunft in German , and his face suddenly brightened . 
`` Well , in that case , I drink to our friendship ! '' 
he cried gaily , filling two glasses with wine . 
Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it .
