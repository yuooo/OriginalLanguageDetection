Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Freemasons and Martinists , even in Novikov 's time . 
For a long while after he had gone , Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room , pondering over his vicious past , and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful , irreproachable , virtuous future that seemed to him so easy . 
It seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous . 
Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul . 
He firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue , and that is how Freemasonry presented itself to him . 
On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival , he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a Kempis , whose book had been sent him by someone unknown . 
One thing he continually realized as he read that book : the joy , hitherto unknown to him , of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection , and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men , which Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to him . 
A week after his arrival , the young Polish count , Willarski , whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society , came into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which Dolokhov 's second had called on him , and , having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room , addressed Pierre . 
`` I have come to you with a message and an offer , Count , '' he said without sitting down . 
`` A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor .
