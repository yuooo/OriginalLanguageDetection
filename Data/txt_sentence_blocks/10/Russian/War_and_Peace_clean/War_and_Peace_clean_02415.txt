On the evening of the first of September , after his interview with Kutuzov , Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war , and because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city ; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp , which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters . 
Distressed , offended , and surprised by all this , Rostopchin had returned to Moscow . 
After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing , and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutuzov .
