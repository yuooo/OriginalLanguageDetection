Nesvitski with an angry face , red and unlike himself , was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner . 
Kutuzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief . 
Blood was flowing from his cheek . 
Prince Andrew forced his way to him . 
`` You are wounded ? '' 
he asked , hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw . 
`` The wound is not here , it is there ! '' 
said Kutuzov , pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers . 
`` Stop them ! '' 
he shouted , and at the same moment , probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them , spurred his horse and rode to the right .
