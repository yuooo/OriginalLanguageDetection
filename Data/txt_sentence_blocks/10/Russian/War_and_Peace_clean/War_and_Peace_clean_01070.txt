Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely . 
`` Well , I did not expect you , I am very glad , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre said nothing ; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise . 
He was struck by the change in him . 
His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face , but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle . 
Prince Andrew had grown thinner , paler , and more manly-looking , but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought . 
As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation , it was long before their conversation could settle on anything . 
They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length . 
At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on : their past life , plans for the future , Pierre 's journeys and occupations , the war , and so on . 
The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend 's look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre , especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future .
