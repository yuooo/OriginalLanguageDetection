The princess , picking up her dress , was taking her seat in the dark carriage , her husband was adjusting his saber ; Prince Hippolyte , under pretense of helping , was in everyone 's way . 
`` Allow me , sir , '' said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold , disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path . 
`` I am expecting you , Pierre , '' said the same voice , but gently and affectionately . 
The postilion started , the carriage wheels rattled . 
Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home . 
`` Well , mon cher , '' said the vicomte , having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage , `` your little princess is very nice , very nice indeed , quite French , '' and he kissed the tips of his fingers . 
Hippolyte burst out laughing . 
`` Do you know , you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs , '' continued the vicomte . 
`` I pity the poor husband , that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch . '' 
Hippolyte spluttered again , and amid his laughter said , `` And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French ?
