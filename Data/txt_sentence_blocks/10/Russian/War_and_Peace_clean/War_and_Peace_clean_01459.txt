Do you remember when I was punished once about some plums ? 
You were all dancing , and I sat sobbing in the schoolroom ? 
I shall never forget it : I felt sad and sorry for everyone , for myself , and for everyone . 
And I was innocent -- that was the chief thing , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do you remember ? '' 
`` I remember , '' answered Nicholas . 
`` I remember that I came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you , but do you know , I felt ashamed to . 
We were terribly absurd . 
I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you . 
Do you remember ? ''
