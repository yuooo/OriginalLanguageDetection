The latter was very attentive to Anna Pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies . 
Prince Vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires . 
`` Well , have you heard the great news ? 
Prince Kutuzov is field marshal ! 
All dissensions are at an end ! 
I am so glad , so delighted ! 
At last we have a man ! '' 
said he , glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room . 
The `` man of great merit , '' despite his desire to obtain the post of director , could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasili of his former opinion .
