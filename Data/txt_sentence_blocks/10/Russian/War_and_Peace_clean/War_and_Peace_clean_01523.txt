Prince Bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply , but changed his mind , evidently considering him too young . 
`` I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the Note was worded , '' remarked Count Rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him . 
Pierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment , not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note . 
`` Does it matter , Count , how the Note is worded , '' he asked , `` so long as its substance is forcible ? '' 
`` My dear fellow , with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style , '' returned Count Rostopchin . 
Pierre now understood the count 's dissatisfaction with the wording of the Note . 
`` One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up , '' remarked the old prince . 
`` There in Petersburg they are always writing - not notes only but even new laws . 
My Andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for Russia . 
Nowadays they are always writing ! ''
