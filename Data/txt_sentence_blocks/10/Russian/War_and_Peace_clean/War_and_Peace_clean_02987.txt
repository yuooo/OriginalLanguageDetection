`` Well , that 's all -- everything , '' said Natasha . 
She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered , almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains , struck her head against it , and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow . 
Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world . 
Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room . 
At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas ' face , which resembled his father 's , affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly , took out his handkerchief , and went to the window . 
He wished to take leave of Princess Mary , but she would not let him go . 
`` No , Natasha and I sometimes do n't go to sleep till after two , so please do n't go . 
I will order supper . 
Go downstairs , we will come immediately . '' 
Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him : `` This is the first time she has talked of him like that . ''
