I wish they would come sooner . 
I hope to be friends with her . 
You have known them a long time , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Tell me honestly the whole truth : what sort of girl is she , and what do you think of her ? 
-- The real truth , because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his father 's will that I should like to know ... '' An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations , and repeated requests to be told the whole truth , expressed ill-will on the princess ' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should disapprove of Andrew 's choice ; but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought . 
`` I do n't know how to answer your question , '' he said , blushing without knowing why . 
`` I really do n't know what sort of girl she is ; I ca n't analyze her at all . 
She is enchanting , but what makes her so I do n't know . 
That is all one can say about her . '' 
Princess Mary sighed , and the expression on her face said : `` Yes , that 's what I expected and feared . ''
