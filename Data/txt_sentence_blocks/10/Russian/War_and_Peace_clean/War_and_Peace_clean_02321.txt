`` You would be more comfortable somewhere in a house ... in ours , for instance ... the family are leaving . '' 
`` I do n't know if it would be allowed , '' replied the officer in a weak voice . 
`` Here is our commanding officer ... ask him , '' and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts .

`` May the wounded men stay in our house ? '' 
she asked . 
The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile . 
`` Which one do you want , Ma'am ` selle ? ''
