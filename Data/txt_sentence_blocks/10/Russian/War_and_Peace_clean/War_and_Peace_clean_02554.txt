The Empress Marya , concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage , had given directions that they should all be removed to Kazan , and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up . 
The Empress Elisabeth , however , when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give -- with her characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign , but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg . 
At Anna Pavlovna 's on the twenty-sixth of August , the very day of the battle of Borodino , there was a soiree , the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius . 
It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical , patriotic eloquence . 
Prince Vasili himself , famed for his elocution , was to read it . 
-LRB- He used to read at the Empress ' . -RRB- 
The art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words , quite independently of their meaning , in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur , so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another . 
This reading , as was always the case at Anna Pavlovna 's soirees , had a political significance . 
That evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic temper . 
A good many people had already arrived , but Anna Pavlovna , not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room , did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation .
