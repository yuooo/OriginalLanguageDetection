The countess pressed her daughter 's hand , closed her eyes , and became quiet for a moment . 
Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness , glanced vacantly around her , and seeing Natasha began to press her daughter 's head with all her strength . 
Then she turned toward her daughter 's face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it . 
`` Natasha , you love me ? '' 
she said in a soft trustful whisper . 
`` Natasha , you would not deceive me ? 
You 'll tell me the whole truth ? '' 
Natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness . 
`` My darling Mummy ! ''
