`` Ah , you 'd better not go , sir , '' said the doctor , `` or you may have to stay here yourself . '' 
But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way . 
`` Only do n't blame me ! '' 
the doctor shouted up after him . 
Rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor . 
The smell was so strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on . 
A door opened to the right , and an emaciated sallow man on crutches , barefoot and in underclothing , limped out and , leaning against the doorpost , looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing . 
Glancing in at the door , Rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats . 
`` May I go in and look ? '' 
`` What is there to see ? ''
