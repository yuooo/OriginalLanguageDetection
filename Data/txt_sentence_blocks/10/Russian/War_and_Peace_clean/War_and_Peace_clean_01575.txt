He passed up to the front rows , not noticing anyone . 
Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him , looking at and indicating the Rostovs ' box . 
On seeing Natasha Pierre grew animated and , hastily passing between the rows , came toward their box .

While conversing with Pierre , Natasha heard a man 's voice in Countess Bezukhova 's box and something told her it was Kuragin . 
She turned and their eyes met . 
Almost smiling , he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him , to look at him like that , to be so sure he admired her , and not to be acquainted with him .

They began waving their arms .
