Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it . 
But , coming toward him , he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf . 
There was still hope . 
A long , yellowish young borzoi , one Nicholas did not know , from another leash , rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over . 
But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and , gnashing her teeth , flew at the yellowish borzoi , which , with a piercing yelp , fell with its head on the ground , bleeding from a gash in its side . 
`` Karay ? 
Old fellow ! 
... '' wailed Nicholas . 
Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf 's path , the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it . 
As if aware of her danger , the wolf turned her eyes on Karay , tucked her tail yet further between her legs , and increased her speed .
