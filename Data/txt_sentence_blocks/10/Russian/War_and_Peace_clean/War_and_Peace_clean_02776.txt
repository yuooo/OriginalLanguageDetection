So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times , and so it is to our own day . 
All Napoleon 's wars serve to confirm this rule . 
In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses its rights , and the rights and the strength of France increase . 
The victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt destroy the independent existence of Prussia . 
But then , in 1812 , the French gain a victory near Moscow . 
Moscow is taken and after that , with no further battles , it is not Russia that ceases to exist , but the French army of six hundred thousand , and then Napoleonic France itself . 
To strain the facts to fit the rules of history : to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the hands of the Russians , or that after Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon 's army , is impossible . 
After the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious , yet the French army ceased to exist . 
What does this mean ? 
If it were an example taken from the history of China , we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon -LRB- which is the historians ' usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards -RRB- ; if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part , we might treat it as an exception ; but this event occurred before our fathers ' eyes , and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland , and it happened in the greatest of all known wars .
