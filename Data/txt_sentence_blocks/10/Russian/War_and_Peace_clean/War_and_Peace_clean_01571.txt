First the man in the tight trousers sang alone , then she sang , then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white , obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her . 
They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting , while the man and woman on the stage -- who represented lovers -- began smiling , spreading out their arms , and bowing . 
After her life in the country , and in her present serious mood , all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha . 
She could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music ; she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved , spoke , and sang so strangely in that brilliant light . 
She knew what it was all meant to represent , but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them . 
She looked at the faces of the audience , seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced , but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage , and expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned . 
`` I suppose it has to be like this ! '' 
she thought . 
She kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes , especially at Helene in the next box , who -- apparently quite unclothed -- sat with a quiet tranquil smile , not taking her eyes off the stage . 
And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd , Natasha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while .
