Ahead , the enemy was already visible . 
Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron . 
Rostov raised his saber , ready to strike , but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko , who was galloping ahead , shot away from him , and Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot . 
From behind him Bondarchuk , an hussar he knew , jolted against him and looked angrily at him . 
Bondarchuk 's horse swerved and galloped past . 
`` How is it I am not moving ? 
I have fallen , I am killed ! '' 
Rostov asked and answered at the same instant . 
He was alone in the middle of a field . 
Instead of the moving horses and hussars ' backs , he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him .
