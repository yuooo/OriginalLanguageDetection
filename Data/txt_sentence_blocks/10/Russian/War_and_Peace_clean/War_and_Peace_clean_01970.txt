`` Where is he ? '' 
`` He 's with the army , Father , at Smolensk . '' 
He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time . 
Then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything , he nodded his head and reopened his eyes . 
`` Yes , '' he said , softly and distinctly . 
`` Russia has perished . 
They 've destroyed her . '' 
And he began to sob , and again tears flowed from his eyes . 
Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face . 
Again he closed his eyes .
