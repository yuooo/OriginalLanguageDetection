His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another , especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield . 
Now , seated on the slope of the trench , he observed the faces of those around him . 
By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery ; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around . 
But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this , and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides . 
`` A live one ! '' 
shouted a man as a whistling shell approached . 
`` Not this way ! 
To the infantry ! '' 
added another with loud laughter , seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports . 
`` Are you bowing to a friend , eh ? ''
