`` But if I want to ... '' `` Natasha , I am in earnest ... '' Natasha did not let her finish . 
She drew the countess ' large hand to her , kissed it on the back and then on the palm , then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle , then the space between the knuckles , then the next knuckle , whispering , `` January , February , March , April , May . 
Speak , Mamma , why do n't you say anything ? 
Speak ! '' 
said she , turning to her mother , who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say . 
`` It wo n't do , my love ! 
Not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days , and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us , and above all it torments him for nothing . 
He may already have found a suitable and wealthy match , and now he 's half crazy . '' 
`` Crazy ? '' 
repeated Natasha .
