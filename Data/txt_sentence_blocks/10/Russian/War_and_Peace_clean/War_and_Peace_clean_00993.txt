The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down , * with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar , and asked if anything more would be wanted . 
* To indicate he did not want more tea . 
`` No . 
Give me the book , '' said the stranger . 
The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work , and the traveler became absorbed in it . 
Pierre looked at him . 
All at once the stranger closed the book , putting in a marker , and again , leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa , sat in his former position with his eyes shut . 
Pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man , opening his eyes , fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre 's face . 
Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look , but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly . 
`` I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov , if I am not mistaken , '' said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice .
