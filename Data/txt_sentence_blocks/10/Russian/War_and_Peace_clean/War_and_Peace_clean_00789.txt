`` And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief , your excellency ? '' 
said Rostov , with his hand to his cap . 
`` You can give the message to His Majesty , '' said Dolgorukov , hurriedly interrupting Bagration . 
On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few hours ' sleep before morning and felt cheerful , bold , and resolute , with elasticity of movement , faith in his good fortune , and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible , pleasant , and easy . 
All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning : there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part , more than that , he was orderly to the bravest general , and still more , he was going with a message to Kutuzov , perhaps even to the sovereign himself . 
The morning was bright , he had a good horse under him , and his heart was full of joy and happiness . 
On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line . 
At first he rode along the line of Bagration 's troops , which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless ; then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov 's cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle ; having passed Uvarov 's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him . 
The firing grew louder and louder . 
In the fresh morning air were now heard , not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before , followed by one or two cannon shots , but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen , interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar .
