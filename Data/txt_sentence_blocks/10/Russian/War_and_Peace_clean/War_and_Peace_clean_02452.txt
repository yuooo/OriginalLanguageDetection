Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town , sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting , and announcing a roll call for that very evening . 
But despite all these measures the men , who had till then constituted an army , flowed all over the wealthy , deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies . 
As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field , but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures , so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city . 
No residents were left in Moscow , and the soldiers -- like water percolating through sand -- spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched . 
The cavalry , on entering a merchant 's house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses , went on , all the same , to the next house which seemed to them better . 
Many of them appropriated several houses , chalked their names on them , and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them . 
Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and , hearing that everything had been abandoned , rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking . 
The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same . 
In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops , and generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves . 
The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses , hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered .
