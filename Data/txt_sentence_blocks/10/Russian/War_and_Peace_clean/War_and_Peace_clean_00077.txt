Good man ! '' 
cried he , addressing Pierre . 
Another voice , from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes , particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring , cried from the window : `` Come here ; part the bets ! '' 
This was Dolokhov , an officer of the Semenov regiment , a notorious gambler and duelist , who was living with Anatole . 
Pierre smiled , looking about him merrily . 
`` I do n't understand . 
What 's it all about ? '' 
`` Wait a bit , he is not drunk yet ! 
A bottle here , '' said Anatole , taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre . 
`` First of all you must drink ! ''
