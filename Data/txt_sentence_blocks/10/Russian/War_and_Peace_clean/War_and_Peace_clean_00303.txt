`` Well ! '' 
he said , turning to his wife . 
And this `` Well ! '' 
sounded coldly ironic , as if he were saying , : `` Now go through your performance . '' 
`` Andrew , already ! '' 
said the little princess , turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband . 
He embraced her . 
She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder . 
He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on , looked into her face , and carefully placed her in an easy chair . 
`` Adieu , Mary , '' said he gently to his sister , taking her by the hand and kissing her , and then he left the room with rapid steps .
