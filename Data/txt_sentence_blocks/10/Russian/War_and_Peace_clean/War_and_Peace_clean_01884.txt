Bagration drove up in a carriage to to the house occupied by Barclay . 
Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer Bagration . 
Despite his seniority in rank Bagration , in this contest of magnanimity , took his orders from Barclay , but , having submitted , agreed with him less than ever . 
By the Emperor 's orders Bagration reported direct to him . 
He wrote to Arakcheev , the Emperor 's confidant : `` It must be as my sovereign pleases , but I can not work with the Minister -LRB- meaning Barclay -RRB- . 
For God 's sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment . 
I can not stand it here . 
Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian can not exist and there is no sense in anything . 
I thought I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland , but it turns out that I am serving Barclay . 
I confess I do not want to . ''
