The smile vanished from Speranski 's white face , which was much improved by the change . 
Probably Prince Andrew 's thought interested him . 
`` Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue , '' * he began , pronouncing French with evident difficulty , and speaking even slower than in Russian but quite calmly . 
* `` If you regard the question from that point of view . '' 
Speranski went on to say that honor , l'honeur , can not be upheld by privileges harmful to the service ; that honor , l'honneur , is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards , which recognize it . 
His arguments were concise , simple , and clear . 
`` An institution upholding honor , the source of emulation , is one similar to the Legion d'honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon , not harmful but helpful to the success of the service , but not a class or court privilege . '' 
`` I do not dispute that , but it can not be denied that court privileges have attained the same end , '' returned Prince Andrew . 
`` Every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily . '' 
`` Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege , Prince , '' said Speranski , indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion .
