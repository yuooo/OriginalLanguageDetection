In front , at a weary gallop and using his leather whip , rode an officer , disheveled and drenched , whose trousers had worked up to above his knees . 
Behind him , standing in the stirrups , trotted a Cossack . 
The officer , a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes , galloped up to Denisov and handed him a sodden envelope . 
`` From the general , '' said the officer . 
`` Please excuse its not being quite dry . '' 
Denisov , frowning , took the envelope and opened it . 
`` There , they kept telling us : ` It 's dangerous , it 's dangerous , ' '' said the officer , addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading the dispatch . 
`` But Komarov and I '' -- he pointed to the Cossack -- `` were prepared . 
We have each of us two pistols ... . 
But what 's this ? ''
