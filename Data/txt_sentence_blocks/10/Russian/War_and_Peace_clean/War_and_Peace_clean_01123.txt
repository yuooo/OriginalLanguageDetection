In the middle of the game , the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them . 
The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them . 
`` There now , Denisov has been worrying , '' said Rostov , `` and here are the provisions . '' 
`` So they are ! '' 
said the officers . 
`` Wo n't the soldiers be glad ! '' 
A little behind the hussars came Denisov , accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking . 
Rostov went to meet them . 
`` I warn you , Captain , '' one of the officers , a short thin man , evidently very angry , was saying . 
`` Have n't I told you I wo n't give them up ? ''
