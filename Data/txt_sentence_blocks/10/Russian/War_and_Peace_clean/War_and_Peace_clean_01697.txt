`` Yes , I am well , '' he said in answer to Pierre 's question , and smiled . 
To Pierre that smile said plainly : `` I am well , but my health is now of no use to anyone . '' 
After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish frontier , about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre , and about M. Dessalles , whom he had brought from abroad to be his son 's tutor , Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Speranski which was still going on between the two old men . 
`` If there were treason , or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon , they would have been made public , '' he said with warmth and haste . 
`` I do not , and never did , like Speranski personally , but I like justice ! '' 
Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar , to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate . 
When Prince Meshcherski had left , Prince Andrew took Pierre 's arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him . 
A bed had been made up there , and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about . 
Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket , from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper . 
He did it all silently and very quickly .
