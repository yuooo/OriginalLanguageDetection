`` The fete is for tomorrow . 
How is your old fellow ? 
Out of sorts ? '' 
`` I wo n't say he is out of sorts , but I fancy he would like to be heard . '' 
`` But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense , but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible . '' 
`` Yes , you have seen him ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , what is Bonaparte like ? 
How did he impress you ? ''
