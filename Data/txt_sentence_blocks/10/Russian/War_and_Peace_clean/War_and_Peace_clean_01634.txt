It 's not your business ! 
It wo n't be you , but I , who 'll suffer . 
Leave me alone , leave me alone ! 
I hate you ! '' 
`` Natasha ! '' 
moaned Sonya , aghast . 
`` I hate you , I hate you ! 
You 're my enemy forever ! '' 
And Natasha ran out of the room . 
Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her .
