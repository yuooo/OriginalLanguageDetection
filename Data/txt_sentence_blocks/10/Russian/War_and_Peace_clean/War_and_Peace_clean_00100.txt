`` So do come and dine with us ! '' 
he said . 
Silence ensued . 
The countess looked at her callers , smiling affably , but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave . 
The visitor 's daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother , when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over , and a girl of thirteen , hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock , darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room . 
It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far . 
Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar , an officer of the Guards , a girl of fifteen , and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket . 
The count jumped up and , swaying from side to side , spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in . 
`` Ah , here she is ! '' 
he exclaimed laughing .
