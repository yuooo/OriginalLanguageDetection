And Pierre , noticing that Terenty wanted a chat , generally kept him there . 
`` Well , tell me ... now , how did you get food ? '' 
he would ask . 
And Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow , and of the old count , and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking , or sometimes listening to Pierre 's stories , and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him . 
The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day , though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity , would sit for hours with Pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general , and especially of the ladies . 
`` It 's a pleasure to talk to a man like that ; he is not like our provincials , '' he would say . 
There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel , and the doctor brought one of them , a young Italian , to see Pierre . 
This officer began visiting Pierre , and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him . 
The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre , talk with him , tell him about his past , his life at home , and his love , and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially against Napoleon . 
`` If all Russians are in the least like you , it is sacrilege to fight such a nation , '' he said to Pierre .
