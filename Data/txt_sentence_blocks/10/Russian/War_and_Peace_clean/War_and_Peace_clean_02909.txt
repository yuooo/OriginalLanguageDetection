Yes , she is splendid ! '' 
`` Mary , '' she said timidly , drawing Princess Mary 's hand to herself , `` Mary , you must n't think me wicked . 
No ? 
Mary darling , how I love you ! 
Let us be quite , quite friends . '' 
And Natasha , embracing her , began kissing her face and hands , making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings . 
From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha . 
They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together . 
When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her . 
Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone .
