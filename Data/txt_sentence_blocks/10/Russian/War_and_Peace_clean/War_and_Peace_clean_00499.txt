But the guns remained loaded , the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly , and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before . 
Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left , Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen . 
Here he dismounted , and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon . 
Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down ; he stood at attention when the officer arrived , but at a sign resumed his measured , monotonous pacing . 
Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen 's bonfires . 
To the left , not far from the farthest cannon , was a small , newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers ' voices in eager conversation . 
It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the greater part of the enemy 's opened out from this battery . 
Just facing it , on the crest of the opposite hill , the village of Schon Grabern could be seen , and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires , the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill . 
To the left from that village , amid the smoke , was something resembling a battery , but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye . 
Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position .
