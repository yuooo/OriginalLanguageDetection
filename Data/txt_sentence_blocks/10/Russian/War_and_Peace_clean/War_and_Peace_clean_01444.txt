She began to cry . 
`` Mamma , do n't cry ! 
Only tell me that you wish it , and you know I will give my life , anything , to put you at ease , '' said Nicholas . 
`` I would sacrifice anything for you -- even my feelings . '' 
But the countess did not want the question put like that : she did not want a sacrifice from her son , she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him . 
`` No , you have not understood me , do n't let us talk about it , '' she replied , wiping away her tears . 
`` Maybe I do love a poor girl , '' said Nicholas to himself . 
`` Am I to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money ? 
I wonder how Mamma could speak so to me . 
Because Sonya is poor I must not love her , '' he thought , `` must not respond to her faithful , devoted love ?
