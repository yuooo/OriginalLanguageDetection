Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them , they dared not look life in the face . 
They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact . 
Everything : a carriage passing rapidly in the street , a summons to dinner , the maid 's inquiry what dress to prepare , or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy , seemed an insult , painfully irritated the wound , interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination , and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them . 
Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain . 
They spoke little even to one another , and when they did it was of very unimportant matters . 
Both avoided any allusion to the future . 
To admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory . 
Still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead . 
It seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words , and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes . 
Continued abstention from speech , and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject -- this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention -- brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling .
