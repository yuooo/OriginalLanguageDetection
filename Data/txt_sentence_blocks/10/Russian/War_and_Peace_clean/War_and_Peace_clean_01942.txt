We can not fight in this way , or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow ... There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace . 
God forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats ! 
You would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform . 
If it has come to this -- we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand ... One man ought to be in command , and not two . 
Your Minister may perhaps be good as a Minister , but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable , yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country ... . 
I am really frantic with vexation ; forgive my writing boldly . 
It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace , and that the Minister should command the army , does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all . 
So I write you frankly : call out the militia . 
For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way . 
The whole army feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen .
