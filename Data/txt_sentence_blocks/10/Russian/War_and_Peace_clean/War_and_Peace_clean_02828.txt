Besides , I want to go very much and certainly will go , so do n't hinder me , '' said he . 
`` It will only make things worse ... '' Having put on French greatcoats and shakos , Petya and Dolokhov rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French camp , and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow . 
On reaching the bottom , Dolokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge . 
Petya , his heart in his mouth with excitement , rode by his side . 
`` If we 're caught , I wo n't be taken alive ! 
I have a pistol , '' whispered he . 
`` Do n't talk Russian , '' said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper , and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge : `` Qui vive ? '' 
* and the click of a musket . 
* `` Who goes there ? ''
