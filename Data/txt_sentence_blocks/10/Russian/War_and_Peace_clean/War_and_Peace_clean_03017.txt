`` I shall look forward very much to your return , '' she added in a whisper . 
And these simple words , her look , and the expression on her face which accompanied them , formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories , interpretations , and happy meditations for Pierre . '' ' 
I shall look forward very much to your return ... ' Yes , yes , how did she say it ? 
Yes , ' I shall look forward very much to your return . ' 
Oh , how happy I am ! 
What is happening to me ? 
How happy I am ! '' 
said Pierre to himself . 
There was nothing in Pierre 's soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of Helene . 
He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken , or say : `` Oh , why did I not say that ? ''
