The troops of the left flank , infantry and hussars alike , felt that the commander did not himself know what to do , and this irresolution communicated itself to the men . 
`` If only they would be quick ! '' 
thought Rostov , feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars . 
`` Fo ` ward , with God , lads ! '' 
rang out Denisov 's voice . 
`` At a twot fo ` ward ! '' 
The horses ' croups began to sway in the front line . 
Rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord . 
Before him , on the right , Rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy . 
Shots could be heard , but some way off .
