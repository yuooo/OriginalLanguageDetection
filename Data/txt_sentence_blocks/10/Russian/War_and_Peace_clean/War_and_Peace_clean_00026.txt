`` Charming ! '' 
whispered the little princess , sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it . 
The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue , but just then Anna Pavlovna , who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her , noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe , so she hurried to the rescue . 
Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power , and the latter , evidently interested by the young man 's simple-minded eagerness , was explaining his pet theory . 
Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally , which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved . 
`` The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people , '' the abbe was saying . 
`` It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia -- barbaric as she is said to be -- to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe , and it would save the world ! '' 
`` But how are you to get that balance ? '' 
Pierre was beginning . 
At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and , looking severely at Pierre , asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate .
