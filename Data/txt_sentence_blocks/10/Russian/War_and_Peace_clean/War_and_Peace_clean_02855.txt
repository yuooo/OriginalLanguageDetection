`` Wait ? 
... Hurrah-ah-ah ! '' 
shouted Petya , and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest . 
A volley was heard , and some bullets whistled past , while others plashed against something . 
The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after Petya into the gateway of the courtyard . 
In the dense wavering smoke some of the French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the Cossacks , while others ran down the hill toward the pond . 
Petya was galloping along the courtyard , but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely , slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle . 
His horse , having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light , stopped suddenly , and Petya fell heavily on to the wet ground . 
The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless . 
A bullet had pierced his skull .
