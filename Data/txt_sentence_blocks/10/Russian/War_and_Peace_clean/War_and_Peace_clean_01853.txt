Why , you meant to spend the evening with us ... . 
You do n't often come nowadays as it is , and this girl of mine , '' said the count good-naturedly , pointing to Natasha , `` only brightens up when you 're here . '' 
`` Yes , I had forgotten ... I really must go home ... business ... '' said Pierre hurriedly . 
`` Well , then , au revoir ! '' 
said the count , and went out of the room . 
`` Why are you going ? 
Why are you upset ? '' 
asked Natasha , and she looked challengingly into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` Because I love you ! '' 
was what he wanted to say , but he did not say it , and only blushed till the tears came , and lowered his eyes .
