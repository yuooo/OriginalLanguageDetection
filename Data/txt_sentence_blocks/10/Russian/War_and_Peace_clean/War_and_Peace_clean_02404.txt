Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself , the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yauza bridge to overtake his regiment . 
But Mavra Kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes , pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer . 
From an unfinished house on the Varvarka , the ground floor of which was a dramshop , came drunken shouts and songs . 
On benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands . 
Tipsy and perspiring , with dim eyes and wide-open mouths , they were all laboriously singing some song or other . 
They were singing discordantly , arduously , and with great effort , evidently not because they wished to sing , but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree . 
One , a tall , fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat , was standing over the others . 
His face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin , compressed , twitching lips and dull , gloomy , fixed eyes . 
Evidently possessed by some idea , he stood over those who were singing , and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow , trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers . 
The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand , as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare .
