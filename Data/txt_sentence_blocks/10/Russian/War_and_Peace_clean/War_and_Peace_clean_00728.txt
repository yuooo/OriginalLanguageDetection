As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan , Prince Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map , but at Prince Andrew 's face . 
`` There will be a council of war at Kutuzov 's tonight , though ; you can say all this there , '' remarked Dolgorukov . 
`` I will do so , '' said Prince Andrew , moving away from the map . 
`` Whatever are you bothering about , gentlemen ? '' 
said Bilibin , who , till then , had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke . 
`` Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat , the glory of our Russian arms is secure . 
Except your Kutuzov , there is not a single Russian in command of a column ! 
The commanders are : Herr General Wimpfen , le Comte de Langeron , le Prince de Lichtenstein , le Prince , de Hohenlohe , and finally Prishprish , and so on like all those Polish names . '' 
`` Be quiet , backbiter ! '' 
said Dolgorukov .
