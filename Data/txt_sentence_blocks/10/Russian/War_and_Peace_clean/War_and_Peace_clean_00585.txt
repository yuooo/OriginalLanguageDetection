On Helene 's name day , a small party of just their own people -- as his wife said -- met for supper at Prince Vasili 's . 
All these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening . 
The visitors were seated at supper . 
Princess Kuragina , a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome , was sitting at the head of the table . 
On either side of her sat the more important guests -- an old general and his wife , and Anna Pavlovna Scherer . 
At the other end sat the younger and less important guests , and there too sat the members of the family , and Pierre and Helene , side by side . 
Prince Vasili was not having any supper : he went round the table in a merry mood , sitting down now by one , now by another , of the guests . 
To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Helene , whose presence he seemed not to notice . 
He enlivened the whole party . 
The wax candles burned brightly , the silver and crystal gleamed , so did the ladies ' toilets and the gold and silver of the men 's epaulets ; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table , the clatter of plates , knives , and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations .
