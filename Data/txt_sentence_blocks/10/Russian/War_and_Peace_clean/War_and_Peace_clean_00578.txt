Helene seemed to say . 
`` You had not noticed that I am a woman ? 
Yes , I am a woman who may belong to anyone -- to you too , '' said her glance . 
And at that moment Pierre felt that Helene not only could , but must , be his wife , and that it could not be otherwise . 
He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her . 
How and when this would be he did not know , he did not even know if it would be a good thing -LRB- he even felt , he knew not why , that it would be a bad thing -RRB- , but he knew it would happen . 
Pierre dropped his eyes , lifted them again , and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him , as he had seen her every day until then , but he could no longer do it . 
He could not , any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass . 
She was terribly close to him . 
She already had power over him , and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will .
