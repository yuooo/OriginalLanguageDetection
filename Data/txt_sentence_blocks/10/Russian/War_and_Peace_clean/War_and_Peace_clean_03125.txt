`` Yes , I think so , '' he said reluctantly , and left the study . 
The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table . 
He flushed and went up to Nicholas . 
`` Uncle , forgive me , I did that ... unintentionally , '' he said , pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens . 
Nicholas started angrily . 
`` All right , all right , '' he said , throwing the bits under the table . 
And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty , he turned away from the boy . 
`` You ought not to have been here at all , '' he said . 
The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies , but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best -- recollections of 1812 . 
Denisov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them .
