Speranski smiled and , with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course , told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation . 
For a few moments all were silent . 
Having sat some time at table , Speranski corked a bottle of wine and , remarking , `` Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair , '' passed it to the servant and got up . 
All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room . 
Two letters brought by a courier were handed to Speranski and he took them to his study . 
As soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another . 
`` Now for the recitation ! '' 
said Speranski on returning from his study . 
`` A wonderful talent ! '' 
he said to Prince Andrew , and Magnitski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which he had composed about various well-known Petersburg people .
