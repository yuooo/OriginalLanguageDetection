Pierre , in reply , sincerely agreed with her as to Helene 's perfection of manner . 
If he ever thought of Helene , it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society . 
The old aunt received the two young people in her corner , but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna Pavlovna . 
She looked at her niece , as if inquiring what she was to do with these people . 
On leaving them , Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre 's sleeve , saying : `` I hope you wo n't say that it is dull in my house again , '' and she glanced at Helene . 
Helene smiled , with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted . 
The aunt coughed , swallowed , and said in French that she was very pleased to see Helene , then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look . 
In the middle of a dull and halting conversation , Helene turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone . 
Pierre was so used to that smile , and it had so little meaning for him , that he paid no attention to it . 
The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre 's father , Count Bezukhov , and showed them her own box .
