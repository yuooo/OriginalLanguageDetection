Amid the general rumble , the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night . 
The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans , which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night . 
After a while the moving mass became agitated , someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite , and said something in passing : `` What did he say ? 
Where to , now ? 
Halt , is it ? 
Did he thank us ? '' 
came eager questions from all sides . 
The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt : evidently those in front had halted . 
All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road . 
Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible .
