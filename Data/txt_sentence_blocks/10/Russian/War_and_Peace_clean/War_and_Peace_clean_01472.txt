`` Nothing , '' said he and turned again to the horses . 
When they came out onto the beaten highroad -- polished by sleigh runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs , the marks of which were visible in the moonlight -- the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace . 
The near side horse , arching his head and breaking into a short canter , tugged at his traces . 
The shaft horse swayed from side to side , moving his ears as if asking : `` Is n't it time to begin now ? '' 
In front , already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off , the black horses driven by Zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow . 
From that sleigh one could hear the shouts , laughter , and voices of the mummers . 
`` Gee up , my darlings ! '' 
shouted Nicholas , pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip . 
It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder -- ever increasing their gallop - that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying . 
Nicholas looked back .
