A bee settling on a flower has stung a child . 
And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people .

Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen , and that it exists to perpetuate its race .
