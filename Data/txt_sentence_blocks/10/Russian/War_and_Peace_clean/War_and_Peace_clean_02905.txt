Natasha went up to her . 
`` You have improved in looks and grown more manly , '' continued the countess , taking her daughter 's hand . 
`` Mamma ! 
What are you saying ... '' `` Natasha , he is no more , no more ! '' 
And embracing her daughter , the countess began to weep for the first time . 
Princess Mary postponed her departure . 
Sonya and the count tried to replace Natasha but could not . 
They saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair . 
For three weeks Natasha remained constantly at her mother 's side , sleeping on a lounge chair in her room , making her eat and drink , and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender , caressing tones soothed her mother . 
The mother 's wounded spirit could not heal .
