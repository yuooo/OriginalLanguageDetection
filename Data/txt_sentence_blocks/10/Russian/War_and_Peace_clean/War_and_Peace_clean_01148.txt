Denisov was moodily silent all the evening . 
Late in the evening , when Rostov was about to leave , he asked Denisov whether he had no commission for him . 
`` Yes , wait a bit , '' said Denisov , glancing round at the officers , and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window , where he had an inkpot , and sat down to write . 
`` It seems it 's no use knocking one 's head against a wall ! '' 
he said , coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope . 
In it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor , in which Denisov , without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials , simply asked for pardon . 
`` Hand it in . 
It seems ... '' He did not finish , but gave a painfully unnatural smile . 
Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of Denisov 's affairs , Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor . 
On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in Tilsit .
