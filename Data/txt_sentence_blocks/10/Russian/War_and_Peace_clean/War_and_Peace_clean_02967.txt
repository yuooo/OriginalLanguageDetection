Willarski was a married man with a family , busy with his family affairs , his wife 's affairs , and his official duties . 
He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life , and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family . 
Military , administrative , political , and Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention . 
And Pierre , without trying to change the other 's views and without condemning him , but with the quiet , joyful , and amused smile now habitual to him , was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon . 
There was a new feature in Pierre 's relations with Willarski , with the princess , with the doctor , and with all the people he now met , which gained for him the general good will . 
This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man 's convictions by words , and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking , feeling , and seeing things each from his own point of view . 
This legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for , and the interest he took in , other people . 
The difference , and sometimes complete contradiction , between men 's opinions and their lives , and between one man and another , pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile . 
In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked . 
Formerly all pecuniary questions , especially requests for money to which , as an extremely wealthy man , he was very exposed , produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity .
