And when there was a war , like this one , it would be war ! 
And then the determination of the troops would be quite different .

War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life ; and we ought to understand that and not play at war . 
We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously .

The military calling is the most highly honored .
