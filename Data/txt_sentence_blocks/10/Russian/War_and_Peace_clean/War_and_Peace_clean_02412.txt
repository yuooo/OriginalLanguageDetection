The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31 When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused , but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him , he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning . 
`` Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness , '' he read -LRB- `` Sirin Highness , '' said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow -RRB- , `` to consult with him to act , and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels . 
We too will take part ... '' the reader went on , and then paused -LRB- `` Do you see , '' shouted the youth victoriously , `` he 's going to clear up the whole affair for you ... '' -RRB- , `` in destroying them , and will send these visitors to the devil . 
I will come back to dinner , and we 'll set to work . 
We will do , completely do , and undo these scoundrels . '' 
The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence . 
The tall lad hung his head gloomily . 
It was evident that no one had understood the last part . 
In particular , the words `` I will come back to dinner , '' evidently displeased both reader and audience . 
The people 's minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible -- it was what any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should not say .
