He was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers . 
In the regiment they called him `` our prince , '' were proud of him and loved him . 
But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment , to Timokhin and the like -- people quite new to him , belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past . 
As soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff , he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful , ironical , and contemptuous . 
Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him , and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair . 
In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew , especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the sixth of August -LRB- he considered that it could and should have been defended -RRB- and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow , abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled . 
But despite this , thanks to his regiment , Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions . 
Two days previously he had received news that his father , son , and sister had left for Moscow ; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills , Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there . 
He ordered his horse to be saddled and , leaving his regiment on the march , rode to his father 's estate where he had been born and spent his childhood . 
Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles , Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf , torn from its place and half submerged , was floating on its side in the middle of the pond .
