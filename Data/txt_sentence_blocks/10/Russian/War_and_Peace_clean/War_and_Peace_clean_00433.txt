Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin , a Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service . 
`` Ah , my dear prince ! 
I could not have a more welcome visitor , '' said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew . 
`` Franz , put the prince 's things in my bedroom , '' said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski in . 
`` So you 're a messenger of victory , eh ? 
Splendid ! 
And I am sitting here ill , as you see . '' 
After washing and dressing , Prince Andrew came into the diplomat 's luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him . 
Bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire . 
After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life , Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood .
