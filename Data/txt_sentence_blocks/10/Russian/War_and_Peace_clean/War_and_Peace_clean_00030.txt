I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party , '' said he , turning to Anna Pavlovna . 
His daughter , Princess Helene , passed between the chairs , lightly holding up the folds of her dress , and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face . 
Pierre gazed at her with rapturous , almost frightened , eyes as she passed him . 
`` Very lovely , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Very , '' said Pierre . 
In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre 's hand and said to Anna Pavlovna : `` Educate this bear for me ! 
He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society . 
Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women . '' 
Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand . 
She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasili 's .
