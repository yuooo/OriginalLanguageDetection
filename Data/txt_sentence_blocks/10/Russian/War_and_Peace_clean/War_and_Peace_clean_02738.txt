`` Pass on , pass on ! '' 
he continued without looking at Pierre . 
`` But he is dying , '' Pierre again began . 
`` Be so good ... '' shouted the captain , frowning angrily . 
`` Dram-da-da-dam , dam-dam ... '' rattled the drums , and Pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more .
