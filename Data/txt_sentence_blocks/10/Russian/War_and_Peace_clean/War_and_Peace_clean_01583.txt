Anatole smiled as though to encourage her . 
`` At first I did not like it much , because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes , * is n't that so ? 
But now I like it very much indeed , '' he said , looking at her significantly . 
`` You 'll come to the costume tournament , Countess ? 
Do come ! '' 
and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice , he added , `` You will be the prettiest there . 
Do come , dear countess , and give me this flower as a pledge ! '' 
* Are the pretty women . 
Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself , but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention . 
She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark .
