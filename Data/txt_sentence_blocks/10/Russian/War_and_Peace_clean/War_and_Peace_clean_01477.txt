And if this is really Melyukovka , it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to Melyukovka , '' thought Nicholas . 
It really was Melyukovka , and maids and footmen with merry faces came running , out to the porch carrying candles .

Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova , a broadly built , energetic woman wearing spectacles , sat in the drawing room in a loose dress , surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull . 
They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall , when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule . 
Hussars , ladies , witches , clowns , and bears , after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule , came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted .
