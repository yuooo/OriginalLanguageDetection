He was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him ; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound . 
He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting .

He drank reluctantly , tried to remain alone , and kept turning something over in his mind .
