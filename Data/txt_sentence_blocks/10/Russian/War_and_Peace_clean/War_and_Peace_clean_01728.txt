A French noncommissioned officer of hussars , in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap , shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt . 
Balashev did not do so at once , but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace . 
The noncommissioned officer frowned and , muttering words of abuse , advanced his horse 's chest against Balashev , put his hand to his saber , and shouted rudely at the Russian general , asking : was he deaf that he did not do as he was told ? 
Balashev mentioned who he was . 
The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian general . 
After living at the seat of the highest authority and power , after conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before , and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service , Balashev found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile , and still more this disrespectful , application of brute force to himself . 
The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds , the air was fresh and dewy . 
A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village , and over the fields the larks rose trilling , one after another , like bubbles rising in water . 
Balashev looked around him , awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village . 
The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked silently at one another from time to time .
