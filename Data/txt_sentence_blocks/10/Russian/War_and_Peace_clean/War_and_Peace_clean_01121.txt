Denisov was shouting . 
`` And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields . '' 
`` I have given the order again and again , your honor , but they do n't obey , '' answered the quartermaster . 
Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently : `` Let him fuss and bustle now , my job 's done and I 'm lying down -- capitally ! '' 
He could hear that Lavrushka -- that sly , bold orderly of Denisov 's -- was talking , as well as the quartermaster . 
Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons , biscuits , and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions . 
Then Denisov 's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away . 
`` Saddle ! 
Second platoon ! '' 
`` Where are they off to now ? ''
