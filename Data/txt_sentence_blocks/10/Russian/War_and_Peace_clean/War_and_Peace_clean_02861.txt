However , he did not look at them now , but thought of other things . 
Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another , which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit . 
He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind , though more than a hundred perished in that way . 
He did not think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate . 
Still less did Pierre think about himself . 
The harder his position became and the more terrible the future , the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts , memories , and imaginings that came to him .
