As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her mother 's room . 
His face was puckered up and wet with tears . 
He had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him . 
When he saw Natasha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face . 
`` Pe ... Petya ... Go , go , she ... is calling ... '' and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair , he almost fell into it , covering his face with his hands . 
Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natasha 's whole being . 
Terrible anguish struck her heart , she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying . 
But the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life . 
The sight of her father , the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door , made her immediately forget herself and her own grief . 
She ran to her father , but he feebly waved his arm , pointing to her mother 's door .
