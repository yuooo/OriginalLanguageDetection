The din of many voices was too great ; all he could hear was : `` ahahah ! '' 
and `` rrrr ! '' 
`` What 's that ? 
What do you make of it ? '' 
said Rostov to the hussar beside him . 
`` That must be the enemy 's camp ! '' 
The hussar did not reply . 
`` Why , do n't you hear it ? '' 
Rostov asked again , after waiting for a reply . 
`` Who can tell , your honor ? ''
