The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest . 
A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow , lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost . 
About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest , and the crackling of dry branches . 
`` A bear , lads , '' said one of the men . 
They all raised their heads to listen , and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another . 
These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest . 
They came up to the fire , hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand . 
One was taller than the other ; he wore an officer 's hat and seemed quite exhausted . 
On approaching the fire he had been going to sit down , but fell . 
The other , a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head , was stronger .
