Still laughing , Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew . 
`` Very pleased to see you , Prince , '' he said . 
`` One moment ... '' he went on , turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story . 
`` We have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation , with not a word about business ! ''

It seemed to him that this was not Speranski but someone else . 
Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and unattractive . 
At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes .
