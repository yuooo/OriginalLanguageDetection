said Natasha . 
`` It 's not true , not true ! '' 
cried Pierre . 
`` I am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live -- nor you either . '' 
Suddenly Natasha bent her head , covered her face with her hands , and began to cry . 
`` What is it , Natasha ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Nothing , nothing . '' 
She smiled at Pierre through her tears .
