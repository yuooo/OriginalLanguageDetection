he asked . 
`` Where the devil ... ? '' 
But , noticing his mistake , he broke off short and , with a frown , greeted Dolokhov as a stranger , asking what he could do for him . 
Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment , and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th Regiment . 
None of them knew anything , and Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dolokhov with hostility and suspicion . 
For some seconds all were silent . 
`` If you were counting on the evening soup , you have come too late , '' said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh . 
Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night . 
He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck . 
That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged .
