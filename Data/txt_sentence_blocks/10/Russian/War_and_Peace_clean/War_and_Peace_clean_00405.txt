Every face , from Denisov 's to that of the bugler , showed one common expression of conflict , irritation , and excitement , around chin and mouth . 
The quartermaster frowned , looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them . 
Cadet Mironov ducked every time a ball flew past . 
Rostov on the left flank , mounted on his Rook -- a handsome horse despite its game leg -- had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself . 
He was glancing at everyone with a clear , bright expression , as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire . 
But despite himself , on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth . 
`` Who 's that curtseying there ? 
Cadet Miwonov ! 
That 's not wight ! 
Look at me , '' cried Denisov who , unable to keep still on one spot , kept turning his horse in front of the squadron .
