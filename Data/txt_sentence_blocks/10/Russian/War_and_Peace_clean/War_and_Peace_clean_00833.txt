Natasha , after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses , holding him tight by the skirt of his coat , sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly . 
All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy , and all around were lips seeking a kiss . 
Sonya too , all rosy red , clung to his arm and , radiant with bliss , looked eagerly toward his eyes , waiting for the look for which she longed . 
Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty , especially at this moment of happy , rapturous excitement . 
She gazed at him , not taking her eyes off him , and smiling and holding her breath . 
He gave her a grateful look , but was still expectant and looking for someone . 
The old countess had not yet come . 
But now steps were heard at the door , steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother 's . 
Yet it was she , dressed in a new gown which he did not know , made since he had left .
