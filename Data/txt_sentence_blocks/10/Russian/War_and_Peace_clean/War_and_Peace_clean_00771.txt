he murmured to himself , still not replying to the Austrian . 
Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order . 
Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance , he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns . 
The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief 's order to throw out skirmishers . 
He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away . 
There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist . 
Having given orders in the commander in chief 's name to rectify this omission , Prince Andrew galloped back . 
Kutuzov still in the same place , his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age , sat yawning wearily with closed eyes . 
The troops were no longer moving , but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground . 
`` All right , all right ! ''
