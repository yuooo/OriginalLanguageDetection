Dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses . 
`` Will they bring our horses or not ? '' 
thought Petya , instinctively drawing nearer to Dolokhov . 
The horses were brought . 
`` Good evening , gentlemen , '' said Dolokhov . 
Petya wished to say `` Good night '' but could not utter a word . 
The officers were whispering together . 
Dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still , then he rode out of the yard at a footpace . 
Petya rode beside him , longing to look round to see whether or no the French were running after them , but not daring to . 
Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the open country , but through the village .
