Rostopchin , though he had patriotic sentiments , was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding . 
Ever since the enemy 's entry into Smolensk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of `` the heart of Russia . '' 
Not only did it seem to him -LRB- as to all administrators -RRB- that he controlled the external actions of Moscow 's inhabitants , but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters , written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority . 
Rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling , and had grown so used to it , that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet , so that he positively did not know what to do . 
Though he knew it was coming , he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned , and did not prepare for it . 
The inhabitants left against his wishes . 
If the government offices were removed , this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly . 
He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself . 
As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination , though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect , he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs . 
All his painstaking and energetic activity -LRB- in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question -RRB- had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the French .
