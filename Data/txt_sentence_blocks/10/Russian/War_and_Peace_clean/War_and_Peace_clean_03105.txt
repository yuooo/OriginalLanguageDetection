How stupid and deaf she is ! '' 
Another pretext would be her snuff , which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough . 
After these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow , and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Belova would again be deaf , the snuff damp , and the countess ' face yellow . 
Just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of thinking -- and the pretext for that was a game of patience . 
When she needed to cry , the deceased count would be the pretext . 
When she wanted to be agitated , Nicholas and his health would be the pretext , and when she felt a need to speak spitefully , the pretext would be Countess Mary . 
When her vocal organs needed exercise , which was usually toward seven o'clock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a darkened room , the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience . 
The old lady 's condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it , and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs . 
Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between Nicholas , Pierre , Natasha , and Countess Mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed .
