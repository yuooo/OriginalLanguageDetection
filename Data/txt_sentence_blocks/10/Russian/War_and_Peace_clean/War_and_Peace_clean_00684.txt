Again Rostov looked intently into Boris ' eyes and sighed . 
Berg returned , and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated . 
The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia , Poland , and abroad . 
They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander , the Grand Duke , and told stories of his kindness and irascibility . 
Berg , as usual , kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself , but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke 's quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement . 
With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion , shouting : `` Arnauts ! '' 
-LRB- `` Arnauts '' was the Tsarevich 's favorite expression when he was in a rage -RRB- and called for the company commander . 
`` Would you believe it , Count , I was not at all alarmed , because I knew I was right . 
Without boasting , you know , I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord 's Prayer . 
So , Count , there never is any negligence in my company , and so my conscience was at ease .
