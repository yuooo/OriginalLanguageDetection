Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle , picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create , or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers , Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness . 
As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory . 
Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed , but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy , as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away . 
He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle , and feeling reassured he dozed off ... . 
The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning . 
The snow was thawing in the sunshine , the horses galloped quickly , and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds , fields , and villages . 
At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded . 
The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart , shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse . 
In each of the long German carts six or more pale , dirty , bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road . 
Some of them were talking -LRB- he heard Russian words -RRB- , others were eating bread ; the more severely wounded looked silently , with the languid interest of sick children , at the envoy hurrying past them .
