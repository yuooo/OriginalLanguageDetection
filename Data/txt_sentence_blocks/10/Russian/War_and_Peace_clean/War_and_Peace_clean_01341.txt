From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs ' as Natasha 's affianced lover . 
No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha 's engagement to Bolkonski was not announced ; Prince Andrew insisted on that . 
He said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it ; that he had given his word and bound himself forever , but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom . 
If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him . 
Naturally neither Natasha nor her parents wished to hear of this , but Prince Andrew was firm . 
He came every day to the Rostovs ' , but did not behave to Natasha as an affianced lover : he did not use the familiar thou , but said you to her , and kissed only her hand . 
After their engagement , quite different , intimate , and natural relations sprang up between them . 
It was as if they had not known each other till now . 
Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were nothing to one another ; they felt themselves now quite different beings : then they were artificial , now natural and sincere . 
At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew ; he seemed a man from another world , and for a long time Natasha trained the family to get used to him , proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different , but was really just like all of them , and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be .
