`` Faster ! '' 
came the word of command , and Rostov felt Rook 's flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop . 
Rostov anticipated his horse 's movements and became more and more elated . 
He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him . 
This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible -- and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible , but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated . 
`` Oh , how I will slash at him ! '' 
thought Rostov , gripping the hilt of his saber . 
`` Hur-a-a-a-ah ! '' 
came a roar of voices . 
`` Let anyone come my way now , '' thought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others .
