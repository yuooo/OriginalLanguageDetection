You 're very smart ! '' 
one of them shouted hoarsely . 
Then a thin , pale soldier , his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band , came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water . 
`` Must one die like a dog ? '' 
said he . 
Tushin told them to give the man some water . 
Then a cheerful soldier ran up , begging a little fire for the infantry . 
`` A nice little hot torch for the infantry ! 
Good luck to you , fellow countrymen . 
Thanks for the fire -- we 'll return it with interest , '' said he , carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick .
