`` Is n't Duport delightful ? '' 
Helene asked her . 
`` Oh , yes , '' replied Natasha . 
During the entr ` acte a whiff of cold air came into Helene 's box , the door opened , and Anatole entered , stooping and trying not to brush against anyone . 
`` Let me introduce my brother to you , '' said Helene , her eyes shifting uneasily from Natasha to Anatole . 
Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder . 
Anatole , who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance , sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness -- ever since the Naryshkins ' ball in fact , at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her . 
Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men . 
He talked boldly and naturally , and Natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk , but that on the contrary his smile was most naive , cheerful , and good-natured . 
Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage .
