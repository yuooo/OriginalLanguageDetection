`` He would not have understood ... yet perhaps he would . '' 
`` I love you awfully ! '' 
Natasha suddenly said . 
`` Awfully , awfully ! '' 
`` No , he would not have approved , '' said Pierre , after reflection . 
`` What he would have approved of is our family life . 
He was always so anxious to find seemliness , happiness , and peace in everything , and I should have been proud to let him see us . 
There now -- you talk of my absence , but you would n't believe what a special feeling I have for you after a separation ... '' `` Yes , I should think ... '' Natasha began . 
`` No , it 's not that . 
I never leave off loving you .
