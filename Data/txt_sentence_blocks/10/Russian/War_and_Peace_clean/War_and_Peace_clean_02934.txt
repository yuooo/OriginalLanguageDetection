`` Yes , it 's all very well , but when a man 's feet are frozen how can he walk ? '' 
`` Eh ? 
Do n't talk nonsense ! '' 
said a sergeant major . 
`` Do you want to be doing the same ? '' 
said an old soldier , turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet . 
`` Well , you know , '' said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice , raising himself at the other side of the fire , `` a plump man gets thin , but for a thin one it 's death . 
Take me , now ! 
I 've got no strength left , '' he added , with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major . 
`` Tell them to send me to hospital ; I 'm aching all over ; anyway I sha n't be able to keep up . ''
