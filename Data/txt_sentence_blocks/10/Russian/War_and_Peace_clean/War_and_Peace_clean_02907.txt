One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever , Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed . 
Natasha lay down , but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back . 
`` I do n't want to sleep , Mary , sit by me a little . '' 
`` You are tired -- try to sleep . '' 
`` No , no . 
Why did you bring me away ? 
She will be asking for me . '' 
`` She is much better . 
She spoke so well today , '' said Princess Mary . 
Natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary 's face .
