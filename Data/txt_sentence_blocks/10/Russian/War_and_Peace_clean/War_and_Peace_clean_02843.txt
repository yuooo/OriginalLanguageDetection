`` Was the cup left here ? '' 
`` There , by the wheel ! '' 
The hussar took the cup . 
`` It must be daylight soon , '' said he , yawning , and went away . 
Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov 's guerrilla band , less than a mile from the road , sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which horses were tethered , that under it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him , that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman 's hut , and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire , that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink ; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this . 
He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality . 
The big dark blotch might really be the watchman 's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth . 
Perhaps the red spot was a fire , or it might be the eye of an enormous monster . 
Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon , but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which , if he fell , he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month , or go on falling and never reach the bottom . 
Perhaps it was just the Cossack , Likhachev , who was sitting under the wagon , but it might be the kindest , bravest , most wonderful , most splendid man in the world , whom no one knew of .
