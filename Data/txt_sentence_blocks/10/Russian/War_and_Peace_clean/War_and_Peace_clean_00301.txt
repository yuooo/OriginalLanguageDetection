`` I will do it all , Father , '' he said . 
`` Well , now , good-by ! '' 
He gave his son his hand to kiss , and embraced him . 
`` Remember this , Prince Andrew , if they kill you it will hurt me , your old father ... '' he paused unexpectedly , and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked : `` but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski , I shall be ashamed ! '' 
`` You need not have said that to me , Father , '' said the son with a smile . 
The old man was silent . 
`` I also wanted to ask you , '' continued Prince Andrew , `` if I 'm killed and if I have a son , do not let him be taken away from you - as I said yesterday ... let him grow up with you ... . 
Please . '' 
`` Not let the wife have him ? '' 
said the old man , and laughed .
