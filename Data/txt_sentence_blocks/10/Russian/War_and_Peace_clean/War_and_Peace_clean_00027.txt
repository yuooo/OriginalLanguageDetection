`` I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society , more especially of the feminine society , in which I have had the honor of being received , that I have not yet had time to think of the climate , '' said he . 
Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape , Anna Pavlovna , the more conveniently to keep them under observation , brought them into the larger circle .

He was a very handsome young man , of medium height , with firm , clearcut features .

It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room , but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them . 
And among all these faces that he found so tedious , none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife . 
He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face , kissed Anna Pavlovna 's hand , and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company . 
`` You are off to the war , Prince ? ''
