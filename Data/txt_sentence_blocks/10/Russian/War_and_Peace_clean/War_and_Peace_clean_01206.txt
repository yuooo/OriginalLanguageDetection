Having talked for a little while in the general circle , Speranski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room . 
It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolkonski . 
`` I had no chance to talk with you , Prince , during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me , '' he said with a mildly contemptuous smile , as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking . 
This flattered Prince Andrew . 
`` I have known of you for a long time : first from your action with regard to your serfs , a first example , of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators ; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers , which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle . '' 
`` No , '' said Prince Andrew , `` my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege . 
I began the service from the lower grade . '' 
`` Your father , a man of the last century , evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes natural justice . '' 
`` I think , however , that these condemnations have some ground , '' returned Prince Andrew , trying to resist Speranski 's influence , of which he began to be conscious . 
He did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict .
