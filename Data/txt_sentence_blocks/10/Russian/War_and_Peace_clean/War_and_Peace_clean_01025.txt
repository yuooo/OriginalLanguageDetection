But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again . 
`` Now thou hast seen the lesser light , '' uttered a voice . 
Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light ; the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together : `` Sic transit gloria mundi . '' 
Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it . 
Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen . 
Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society . 
In the President 's chair sat a young man he did not know , with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck . 
On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna 's two years before . 
There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins ' . 
All maintained a solemn silence , listening to the words of the President , who held a mallet in his hand .
