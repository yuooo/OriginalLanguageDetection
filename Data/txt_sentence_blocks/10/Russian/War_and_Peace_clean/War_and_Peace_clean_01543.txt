He drove to the Karagins ' with the firm intention of proposing . 
Julie met him in a gay , careless manner , spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday 's ball , and asked when he was leaving . 
Though Boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender , he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy , of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy , and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them . 
Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety , and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone . 
`` Then I should advise you ... '' Boris began , wishing to sting her ; but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim , and have vainly wasted his efforts -- which was a thing he never allowed to happen . 
He checked himself in the middle of the sentence , lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face , and said : `` I did not come here at all to quarrel with you . 
On the contrary ... '' He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on . 
Her irritability had suddenly quite vanished , and her anxious , imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation . 
`` I can always arrange so as not to see her often , '' thought Boris . 
`` The affair has been begun and must be finished ! ''
