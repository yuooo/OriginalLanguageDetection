`` He knows all about it , '' said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre and addressing Natasha . 
`` Let him tell you whether I have told the truth . '' 
Natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen . 
`` Natalya Ilynichna , '' Pierre began , dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do , `` whether it is true or not should make no difference to you , because ... '' `` Then it is not true that he 's married ! '' 
`` Yes , it is true . '' 
`` Has he been married long ? '' 
she asked . 
`` On your honor ? 
... '' Pierre gave his word of honor . 
`` Is he still here ? ''
