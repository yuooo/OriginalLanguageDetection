In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself . 
He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander . 
Just as he had done after Austerlitz , he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this , and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also . 
In 1809 he was a captain in the Guards , wore medals , and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg . 
Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg 's merits , it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer , on excellent terms with his superiors , and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society . 
Four years before , meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater , Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had said in German , `` das soll mein Weib werden , '' * and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her . 
Now in Petersburg , having considered the Rostovs ' position and his own , he decided that the time had come to propose . 
* `` That girl shall be my wife . '' 
Berg 's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him . 
At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostova ; but Berg 's chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing , since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good , indeed excellent .
