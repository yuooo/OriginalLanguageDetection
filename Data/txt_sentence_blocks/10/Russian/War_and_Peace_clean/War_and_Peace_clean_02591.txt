He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service , meditating on a great variety of subjects . 
When the service was over the governor 's wife beckoned him to her . 
`` Have you seen the princess ? '' 
she asked , indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side , beyond the choir . 
Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude , timidity , and pity that immediately overcame him . 
Princess Mary , evidently engrossed by her thoughts , was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church . 
Nicholas looked at her face with surprise . 
It was the same face he had seen before , there was the same general expression of refined , inner , spiritual labor , but now it was quite differently lit up . 
There was a pathetic expression of sorrow , prayer , and hope in it . 
As had occurred before when she was present , Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor 's wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church , and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul .
