An infantryman came to the fire , squatted on his heels , held his hands to the blaze , and turned away his face . 
`` You do n't mind your honor ? '' 
he asked Tushin . 
`` I 've lost my company , your honor . 
I do n't know where ... such bad luck ! '' 
With the soldier , an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire , and addressing Tushin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past . 
After he had gone , two soldiers rushed to the campfire . 
They were quarreling and fighting desperately , each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to . 
`` You picked it up ? 
... I dare say !
