Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow , Pierre looked down at his feet , then quickly glanced at Dolokhov and , bending his finger as he had been shown , fired . 
Not at all expecting so loud a report , Pierre shuddered at the sound and then , smiling at his own sensations , stood still . 
The smoke , rendered denser by the mist , prevented him from seeing anything for an instant , but there was no second report as he had expected . 
He only heard Dolokhov 's hurried steps , and his figure came in view through the smoke . 
He was pressing one hand to his left side , while the other clutched his drooping pistol . 
His face was pale . 
Rostov ran toward him and said something . 
`` No-o-o ! '' 
muttered Dolokhov through his teeth , `` no , it 's not over . '' 
And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber , he sank on the snow beside it .
