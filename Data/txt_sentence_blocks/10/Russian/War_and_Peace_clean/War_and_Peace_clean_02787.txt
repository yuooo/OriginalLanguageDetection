This was the French drummer boy captured that morning . 
Behind them along the narrow , sodden , cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours , and then Cossacks : some in felt cloaks , some in French greatcoats , and some with horsecloths over their heads . 
The horses , being drenched by the rain , all looked black whether chestnut or bay . 
Their necks , with their wet , close-clinging manes , looked strangely thin . 
Steam rose from them . 
Clothes , saddles , reins , were all wet , slippery , and sodden , like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road . 
The men sat huddled up trying not to stir , so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats , their knees , and at the back of their necks . 
In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons , drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front , rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts . 
Denisov 's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his rider 's knee against a tree . 
`` Oh , the devil ! ''
