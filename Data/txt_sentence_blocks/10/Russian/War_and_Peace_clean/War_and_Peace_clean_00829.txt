At last the sleigh bore to the right , drew up at an entrance , and Rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off , the porch , and the post by the side of the pavement . 
He sprang out before the sleigh stopped , and ran into the hall . 
The house stood cold and silent , as if quite regardless of who had come to it . 
There was no one in the hall . 
`` Oh God ! 
Is everyone all right ? '' 
he thought , stopping for a moment with a sinking heart , and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase . 
The well-known old door handle , which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned , turned as loosely as ever . 
A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom . 
Old Michael was asleep on the chest .
