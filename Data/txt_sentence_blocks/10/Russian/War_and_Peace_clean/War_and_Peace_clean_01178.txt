On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers -- this being one of the first examples of the kind in Russia . 
On other estates the serfs ' compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent . 
A trained midwife was engaged for Bogucharovo at his expense , and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs . 
Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his son , who was still in the care of nurses . 
The other half he spent in `` Bogucharovo Cloister , '' as his father called Prince Andrew 's estate . 
Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to Pierre , he diligently followed all that went on , received many books , and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from Petersburg , the very vortex of life , these people lagged behind himself -- who never left the country -- in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs . 
Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books , Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns , and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations . 
In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son , whose guardian he was . 
Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass , the first leaves on the birches , and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky . 
He was not thinking of anything , but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side .
