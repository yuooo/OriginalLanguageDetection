Everywhere he saw the stewards ' accounts , according to which the serfs ' manorial labor had been diminished , and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats . 
What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter 's day , and that the richest peasants -LRB- who formed the deputation -RRB- had begun the chantry long before , but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty . 
He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land , they did still harder work on their own land . 
He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions , and that the pupils ' parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments . 
He did not know that the brick buildings , built to plan , were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased , though lessened on paper . 
He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs ' payments had been diminished by a third , their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half . 
And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg , and wrote enthusiastic letters to his `` brother-instructor '' as he called the Grand Master . 
`` How easy it is , how little effort it needs , to do so much good , '' thought Pierre , `` and how little attention we pay to it ! '' 
He was pleased at the gratitude he received , but felt abashed at receiving it . 
This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple , kindly people .
