Nicholas went hastily to the front porch , saying he felt too hot . 
The crowd of people really had made the house stuffy . 
Outside , there was the same cold stillness and the same moon , but even brighter than before . 
The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed . 
The sky was black and dreary , while the earth was gay . 
`` I am a fool , a fool ! 
what have I been waiting for ? '' 
thought Nicholas , and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch . 
He knew Sonya would pass that way . 
Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path .
