`` Good health ... '' `` It 's a long , long way . 
To my native land ... '' Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs ; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start , then settled down , galloped past the company , and overtook the carriage , still keeping time to the song . 
On returning from the review , Kutuzov took the Austrian general into his private room and , calling his adjutant , asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival , and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand , who was in command of the advanced army . 
Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the room with the required papers . 
Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out . 
`` Ah ! 
... '' said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait , and he went on with the conversation in French . 
`` All I can say , General , '' said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word . 
It was evident that Kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice . 
`` All I can say , General , is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes , the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago .
