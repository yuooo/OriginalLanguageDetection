`` Darling Denisov ! '' 
screamed Natasha , beside herself with rapture , springing to him , putting her arms round him , and kissing him . 
This escapade made everybody feel confused . 
Denisov blushed too , but smiled and , taking Natasha 's hand , kissed it . 
Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him , and the Rostovs all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room . 
The old countess , not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment , sat beside him : the rest , crowding round him , watched every movement , word , or look of his , never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him . 
His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea , handkerchief , and pipe . 
Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him ; but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient , and he kept expecting something more , more and yet more . 
Next morning , after the fatigues of their journey , the travelers slept till ten o'clock . 
In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers , satchels , sabretaches , open portmanteaus , and dirty boots .
