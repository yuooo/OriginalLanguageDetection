Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder . 
The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage . 
Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander , and hungry and weary , making his way past the baggage wagons , rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage . 
Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along , and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors . 
`` Cette armee russe que l'or de l'Angleterre a transportee des extremites de l'univers , nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sort -- -LRB- le sort de l'armee d'Ulm -RRB- . '' 
* He remembered these words in Bonaparte 's address to his army at the beginning of the campaign , and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero , a feeling of wounded pride , and a hope of glory . 
`` And should there be nothing left but to die ? '' 
he thought . 
`` Well , if need be , I shall do it no worse than others . '' 
* `` That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by English gold , we shall cause to share the same fate -- -LRB- the fate of the army at Ulm -RRB- . ''
