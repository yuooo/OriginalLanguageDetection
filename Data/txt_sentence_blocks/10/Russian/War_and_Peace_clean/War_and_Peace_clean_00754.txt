`` Wait till tomorrow morning , we 'll find out everything tomorrow . '' 
`` The picket is still on the hill , your excellency , just where it was in the evening , '' reported Rostov , stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets . 
`` Very good , very good , '' said Bagration . 
`` Thank you , officer . '' 
`` Your excellency , '' said Rostov , `` may I ask a favor ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve . 
May I ask to be attached to the first squadron ? '' 
`` What 's your name ? '' 
`` Count Rostov . ''
