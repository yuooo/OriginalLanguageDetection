`` O Lord , O Lord ! '' 
exclaimed the count . 
`` Where is the manifesto ? '' 
`` The Emperor 's appeal ? 
Oh yes ! '' 
Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers , but could not find them . 
Still slapping his pockets , he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around , evidently expecting Natasha , who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room . 
`` On my word , I do n't know what I 've done with it , '' he said . 
`` There he is , always losing everything ! '' 
remarked the countess .
