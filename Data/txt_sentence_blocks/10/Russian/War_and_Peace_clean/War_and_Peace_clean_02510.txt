What was left of him ? 
Was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant 's ? 
Yes , he was altogether like that . 
In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified . 
When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner , and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders , she imagined a horrible body there , and stood still in terror . 
But an irresistible impulse drew her forward . 
She cautiously took one step and then another , and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage . 
Another man - Timokhin -- was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons , and two others -- the doctor and a valet -- lay on the floor . 
The valet sat up and whispered something . 
Timokhin , kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg , gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise , dressing jacket , and nightcap .
