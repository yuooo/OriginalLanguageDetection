Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend 's company and at last became silent . 
`` I 'll tell you what , my dear fellow , '' said Prince Andrew , who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor , `` I am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round . 
I am going back to my sister today . 
I will introduce you to her . 
But of course you know her already , '' he said , evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common . 
`` We will go after dinner . 
And would you now like to look round my place ? '' 
They went out and walked about till dinnertime , talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately . 
Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings , but even here , while on the scaffolding , in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house , he interrupted himself : `` However , this is not at all interesting . 
Let us have dinner , and then we 'll set off . ''
