`` I wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper . '' 
Only Countess Helene , considering the society of such people as the Bergs beneath her , could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation . 
Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company , and why this would give him pleasure , and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful , he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society -- that Pierre could not refuse , and promised to come . 
`` But do n't be late , Count , if I may venture to ask ; about ten minutes to eight , please . 
We shall make up a rubber . 
Our general is coming . 
He is very good to me . 
We shall have supper , Count . 
So you will do me the favor . ''
