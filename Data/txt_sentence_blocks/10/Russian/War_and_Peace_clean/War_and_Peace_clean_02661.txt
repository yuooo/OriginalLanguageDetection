said Princess Mary , herself surprised at what she was saying . 
`` That , my dear , you must ask the doctor , '' he replied , and again making an evident effort to be affectionate , he said with his lips only -LRB- his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts -RRB- : `` Merci , chere amie , d'etre venue . ''

Princess Mary pressed his hand . 
The pressure made him wince just perceptibly . 
He was silent , and she did not know what to say . 
She now understood what had happened to him two days before . 
In his words , his tone , and especially in that calm , almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world , terrible in one who is alive . 
Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living ; but it was obvious that he failed to understand , not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else -- something the living did not and could not understand -- and which wholly occupied his mind .
