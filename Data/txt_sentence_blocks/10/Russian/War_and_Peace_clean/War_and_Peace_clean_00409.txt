Then he imagined how , after the attack , Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation . 
The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov , familiar to the Pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment , rode up to the colonel . 
After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the regiment , saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff , and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagration . 
He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard . 
`` Colonel , '' he said , addressing Rostov 's enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades , `` there is an order to stop and fire the bridge . '' 
`` An order to who ? '' 
asked the colonel morosely . 
`` I do n't myself know ` to who , ' '' replied the cornet in a serious tone , `` but the prince told me to ` go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge . ' '' 
Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order .
