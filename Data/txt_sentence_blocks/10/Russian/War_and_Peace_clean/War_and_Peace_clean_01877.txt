`` Gentlemen ! '' 
said the Emperor with a quivering voice . 
There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided , so that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying with emotion : `` I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles , but today it has surpassed my expectations . 
I thank you in the name of the Fatherland ! 
Gentlemen , let us act ! 
Time is most precious ... '' The Emperor ceased speaking , the crowd began pressing round him , and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides . 
`` Yes , most precious ... a royal word , '' said Count Rostov , with a sob . 
He stood at the back , and , though he had heard hardly anything , understood everything in his own way . 
From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants . 
There he remained about ten minutes .
