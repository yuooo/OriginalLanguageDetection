Meanwhile the younger generation : Boris , the officer , Anna Mikhaylovna 's son ; Nicholas , the undergraduate , the count 's eldest son ; Sonya , the count 's fifteen-year-old niece , and little Petya , his youngest boy , had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces . 
Evidently in the back rooms , from which they had dashed out so impetuously , the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing-room talk of society scandals , the weather , and Countess Apraksina . 
Now and then they glanced at one another , hardly able to suppress their laughter . 
The two young men , the student and the officer , friends from childhood , were of the same age and both handsome fellows , though not alike . 
Boris was tall and fair , and his calm and handsome face had regular , delicate features . 
Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression . 
Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip , and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm . 
Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room . 
He evidently tried to find something to say , but failed . 
Boris on the contrary at once found his footing , and related quietly and humorously how he had know that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady , before her nose was broken ; how she had aged during the five years he had known her , and how her head had cracked right across the skull .
