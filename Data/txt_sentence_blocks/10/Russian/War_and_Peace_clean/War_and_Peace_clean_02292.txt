They , those strange men he had not previously known , stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else . 
`` To be a soldier , just a soldier ! '' 
thought Pierre as he fell asleep , `` to enter communal life completely , to be imbued by what makes them what they are . 
But how cast off all the superfluous , devilish burden of my outer man ? 
There was a time when I could have done it . 
I could have run away from my father , as I wanted to . 
Or I might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov . '' 
And the memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged Dolokhov flashed through Pierre 's mind , and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhok . 
And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind . 
It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table .
