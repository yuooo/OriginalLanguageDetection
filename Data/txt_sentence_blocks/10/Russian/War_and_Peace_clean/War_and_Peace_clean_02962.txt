All his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him , when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes . 
In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something . 
He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it . 
In everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited , petty , commonplace , and senseless . 
He had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space , where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen . 
And such had European life , politics , Freemasonry , philosophy , and philanthropy seemed to him . 
But even then , at moments of weakness as he had accounted them , his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness , worldliness , and senselessness . 
Now , however , he had learned to see the great , eternal , and infinite in everything , and therefore -- to see it and enjoy its contemplation -- he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men 's heads , and gladly regarded the ever-changing , eternally great , unfathomable , and infinite life around him . 
And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became . 
That dreadful question , `` What for ? ''
