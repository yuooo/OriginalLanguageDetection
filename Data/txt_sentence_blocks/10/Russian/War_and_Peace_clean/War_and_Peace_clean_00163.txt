`` Well , then , old chap , mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich , '' said Shinshin , laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases -- which was a peculiarity of his speech . 
`` Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'etat ; * you want to make something out of your company ? '' 
* You expect to make an income out of the government . 
`` No , Peter Nikolaevich ; I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry . 
Just consider my own position now , Peter Nikolaevich ... '' Berg always spoke quietly , politely , and with great precision . 
His conversation always related entirely to himself ; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself . 
He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable , but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction . 
`` Consider my position , Peter Nikolaevich . 
Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months , even with the rank of lieutenant ; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty , '' said he , looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful , pleasant smile , as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else . 
`` Besides that , Peter Nikolaevich , by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position , '' continued Berg , `` and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards .
