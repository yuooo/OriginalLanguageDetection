she repeated , straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother . 
And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother , refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life , escaped from reality into a world of delirium . 
Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night , nor the next day and night . 
She did not sleep and did not leave her mother . 
Her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment , not explaining or consoling , but recalling her to life . 
During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes , and Natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes , but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak . 
The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly . 
`` How glad I am you have come . 
You are tired . 
Wo n't you have some tea ? ''
