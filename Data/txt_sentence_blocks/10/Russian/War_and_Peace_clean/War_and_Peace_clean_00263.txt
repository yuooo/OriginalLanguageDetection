The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style , wearing an antique coat and powdered hair ; and when Prince Andrew entered his father 's dressing room -LRB- not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms , but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre -RRB- , the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair , wrapped in a powdering mantle , entrusting his head to Tikhon . 
`` Ah ! 
here 's the warrior ! 
Wants to vanquish Buonaparte ? '' 
said the old man , shaking his powdered head as much as the tail , which Tikhon was holding fast to plait , would allow . 
`` You at least must tackle him properly , or else if he goes on like this he 'll soon have us , too , for his subjects ! 
How are you ? '' 
And he held out his cheek . 
The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner . 
-LRB- He used to say that a nap `` after dinner was silver -- before dinner , golden . '' -RRB-
