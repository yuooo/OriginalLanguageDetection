This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power . 
This relation consists in the following : For common action people always unite in certain combinations , in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action , the relation between those taking part in it is always the same . 
Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share , and the smaller number a less direct share , in the collective action for which they have combined . 
Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army . 
Every army is composed of lower grades of the service -- the rank and file -- of whom there are always the greatest number ; of the next higher military rank -- corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer , and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer , and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person . 
A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone , of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file ; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army , and so on to the apex , the point of which will represent the commander in chief . 
The soldiers , of whom there are the most , form the lower section of the cone and its base . 
The soldier himself does the stabbing , hacking , burning , and pillaging , and always receives orders for these actions from men above him ; he himself never gives an order . 
The noncommissioned officers -LRB- of whom there are fewer -RRB- perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers , but they already give commands . 
An officer still less often acts directly himself , but commands still more frequently .
