There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the Rostov family , many fears that the invitation would not arrive , that the dresses would not be ready , or that something would not be arranged as it should be . 
Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya , a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the Dowager Empress , who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high society , was to accompany them to the ball . 
They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten o'clock , but it was already five minutes to ten , and the girls were not yet dressed . 
Natasha was going to her first grand ball . 
She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day . 
All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all -- she herself , Mamma , and Sonya -- should be as well dressed as possible . 
Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands . 
The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress , and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips , with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque . 
Everything essential had already been done ; feet , hands , necks , and ears washed , perfumed , and powdered , as befits a ball ; the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on ; the hairdressing was almost done . 
Sonya was finishing dressing and so was the countess , but Natasha , who had bustled about helping them all , was behindhand .
