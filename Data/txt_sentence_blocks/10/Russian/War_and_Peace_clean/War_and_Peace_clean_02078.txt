To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe , and a trial balloon that was to go up next day . 
The balloon was not yet ready , but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor 's desire . 
The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchin as follows : As soon as Leppich is ready , get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to let him know . 
I have informed him of the matter . 
Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time , that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy 's hands . 
It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief . 
On his way home from Vorontsovo , as he was passing the Bolotnoe Place Pierre , seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place , stopped and got out of his trap . 
A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged . 
The flogging was only just over , and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers , in blue stockings and a green jacket , who was moaning piteously . 
Another criminal , thin and pale , stood near .
