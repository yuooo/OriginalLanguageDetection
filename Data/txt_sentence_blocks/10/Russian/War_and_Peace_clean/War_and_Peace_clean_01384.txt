`` You must n't think we 'll be in anyone 's way , Uncle , '' she said . 
`` We 'll go to our places and wo n't budge . '' 
`` A good thing too , little countess , '' said `` Uncle , '' `` only mind you do n't fall off your horse , '' he added , `` because -- that 's it , come on !

`` Well , nephew , you 're going for a big wolf , '' said `` Uncle . '' 
`` Mind and do n't let her slip ! '' 
`` That 's as may happen , '' answered Rostov . 
`` Karay , here ! ''
