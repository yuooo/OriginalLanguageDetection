he thought . 
`` No , probably he wo n't make his entry into Moscow before noon . '' 
Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him , but hastened to act . 
After arranging his clothes , he took the pistol and was about to go out . 
But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets . 
It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat . 
He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm . 
Besides , it had been discharged , and he had not had time to reload it . 
`` No matter , dagger will do , '' he said to himself , though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger . 
But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design , but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it , Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the pistol , and hid it under his waistcoat .
