`` That 's just it , '' interrupted Dolgorukov quickly , laughing . 
`` You know Bilibin -- he 's a very clever fellow . 
He suggested addressing him as ` Usurper and Enemy of Mankind . ' '' 
Dolgorukov laughed merrily . 
`` Only that ? '' 
said Bolkonski . 
`` All the same , it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address . 
He is a wise and clever fellow . '' 
`` What was it ? '' 
`` To the Head of the French Government ... Au chef du gouvernement francais , '' said Dolgorukov , with grave satisfaction .
