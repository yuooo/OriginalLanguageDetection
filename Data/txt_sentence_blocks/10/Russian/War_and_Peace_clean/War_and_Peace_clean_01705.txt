Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant . 
`` No , I know all is over , '' she said hurriedly . 
`` No , that can never be . 
I 'm only tormented by the wrong I have done him .

A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre 's heart . 
`` I will tell him , I will tell him everything once more , '' said Pierre . 
`` But ... I should like to know one thing ... '' `` Know what ? '' 
Natasha 's eyes asked . 
`` I should like to know , did you love ... '' Pierre did not know how to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him -- `` did you love that bad man ? ''
