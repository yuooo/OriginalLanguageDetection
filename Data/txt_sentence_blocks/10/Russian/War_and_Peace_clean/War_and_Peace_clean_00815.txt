Go on ! '' 
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general , the men themselves not knowing what , or why , they were shouting . 
One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice . 
Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond . 
The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers , and one leg slipped into the water . 
He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist . 
The nearest soldiers shrank back , the gun driver stopped his horse , but from behind still came the shouts : `` Onto the ice , why do you stop ? 
Go on ! 
Go on ! '' 
And cries of horror were heard in the crowd .
