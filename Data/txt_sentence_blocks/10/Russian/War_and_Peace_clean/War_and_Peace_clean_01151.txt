On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June , Count Zhilinski arranged a supper for his French friends . 
The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon 's , there were also several French officers of the Guard , and a page of Napoleon 's , a young lad of an old aristocratic French family . 
That same day , Rostov , profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress , came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski . 
Rostov , in common with the whole army from which he came , was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French -- who from being foes had suddenly become friends -- that had taken place at headquarters and in Boris . 
In the army , Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger , contempt , and fear . 
Only recently , talking with one of Platov 's Cossack officers , Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign , but as a criminal . 
Quite lately , happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road , Rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte . 
Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in Boris ' lodging , dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank . 
As soon as he noticed a French officer , who thrust his head out of the door , that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him . 
He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there .
