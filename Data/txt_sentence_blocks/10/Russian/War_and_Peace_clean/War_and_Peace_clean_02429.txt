For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued . 
Only among the back rows of the people , who were all pressing toward the one spot , could sighs , groans , and the shuffling of feet be heard . 
While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand . 
`` Lads ! '' 
said he , with a metallic ring in his voice . 
`` This man , Vereshchagin , is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing . '' 
The young man in the fur-lined coat , stooping a little , stood in a submissive attitude , his fingers clasped before him . 
His emaciated young face , disfigured by the half-shaven head , hung down hopelessly . 
At the count 's first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye . 
But Rostopchin did not look at him .
