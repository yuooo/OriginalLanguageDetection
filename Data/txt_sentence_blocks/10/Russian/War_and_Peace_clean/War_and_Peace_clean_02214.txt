At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the French had been retaken , but that Prince Bagration was wounded . 
Kutuzov groaned and swayed his head . 
`` Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly , '' he said to one of his adjutants , and then turned to the Duke of Wurttemberg who was standing behind him . 
`` Will Your Highness please take command of the first army ? '' 
Soon after the duke 's departure -- before he could possibly have reached Semenovsk -- his adjutant came back from him and told Kutuzov that the duke asked for more troops . 
Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over the command of the first army , and a request to the duke -- whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment -- to return to him . 
When they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner , and the staff officers congratulated him , Kutuzov smiled . 
`` Wait a little , gentlemen , '' said he . 
`` The battle is won , and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat . 
Still , it is better to wait before we rejoice . ''
