`` Your excellency , I should like to be of use here . 
Allow me to remain with Prince Bagration 's detachment . '' 
`` Get in , '' said Kutuzov , and noticing that Bolkonski still delayed , he added : `` I need good officers myself , need them myself ! '' 
They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence . 
`` There is still much , much before us , '' he said , as if with an old man 's penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkonski 's mind . 
`` If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God , '' he added as if speaking to himself . 
Prince Andrew glanced at Kutuzov 's face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple , where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull , and the empty eye socket . 
`` Yes , he has a right to speak so calmly of those men 's death , '' thought Bolkonski . 
`` That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment , '' he said . 
Kutuzov did not reply .
