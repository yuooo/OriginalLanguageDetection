All along the road groups of French prisoners captured that day -LRB- there were seven thousand of them -RRB- were crowding to warm themselves at campfires . 
Near Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners , buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of , were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed French guns . 
At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who , wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders , moved slowly along the road on his white horse . 
One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured . 
Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying . 
He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners , who presented a specially wretched appearance . 
Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses and cheeks , and nearly all had red , swollen and festering eyes . 
One group of the French stood close to the road , and two of them , one of whom had his face covered with sores , were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands . 
There was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which , after a glance at Kutuzov , the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing . 
Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers .
