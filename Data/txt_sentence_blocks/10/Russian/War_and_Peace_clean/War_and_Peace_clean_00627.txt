Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing , and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer . 
His birth and position in society were not bad . 
`` Well , I 've nothing against it , '' the prince said to himself , `` but he must be worthy of her . 
And that is what we shall see . '' 
`` That is what we shall see ! 
That is what we shall see ! '' 
he added aloud . 
He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step , glancing rapidly round the company . 
He noticed the change in the little princess ' dress , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's ribbon , Princess Mary 's unbecoming coiffure , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's and Anatole 's smiles , and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation . 
`` Got herself up like a fool ! ''
