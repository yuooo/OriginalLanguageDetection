It 's what the old folk used to say : ' A sweating hand 's an open hand , a dry hand 's close . ' 
He 's naked , but yet he 's given it back . '' 
Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces . 
`` But they 'll make grand leg bands , dear friend , '' he said , and went back into the shed . 
Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though the French had offered to move him from the men 's to the officers ' shed , he had stayed in the shed where he was first put . 
In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure ; but thanks to his physical strength and health , of which he had till then been unconscious , and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began , he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully . 
And just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach . 
He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind , that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Borodino . 
He had sought it in philanthropy , in Freemasonry , in the dissipations of town life , in wine , in heroic feats of self-sacrifice , and in romantic love for Natasha ; he had sought it by reasoning -- and all these quests and experiments had failed him . 
And now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death , through privation , and through what he recognized in Karataev .
