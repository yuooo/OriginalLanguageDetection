Prince Andrew got up , went to the door , and tried to open it . 
Someone was holding it shut . 
`` You ca n't come in ! 
You ca n't ! '' 
said a terrified voice from within . 
He began pacing the room . 
The screaming ceased , and a few more seconds went by . 
Then suddenly a terrible shriek -- it could not be hers , she could not scream like that -- came from the bedroom . 
Prince Andrew ran to the door ; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant . 
`` What have they taken a baby in there for ? ''
