That soldier passed on , and after him came another sitting on a cart . 
`` Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to ? '' 
said an orderly , running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it . 
And he also passed on with the wagon . 
Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking . 
`` And then , old fellow , he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun ... '' a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily , with a wide swing of his arm . 
`` Yes , the ham was just delicious ... '' answered another with a loud laugh . 
And they , too , passed on , so that Nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth , or what the ham had to do with it . 
`` Bah ! 
How they scurry .
