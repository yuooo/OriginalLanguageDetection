Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha , who was sitting opposite . 
Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces , and ate a great deal . 
Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines . 
These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward , wrapped in a napkin , from behind the next man 's shoulders and whispered : `` Dry Madeira '' ... `` Hungarian '' ... or `` Rhine wine '' as the case might be . 
Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count 's monogram that stood before his plate , Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment , gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests . 
Natasha , who sat opposite , was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time . 
Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre , and that funny lively little girl 's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why . 
Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya , beside Julie Karagina , to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile . 
Sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy ; now she turned pale , now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another . 
The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children .
