While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh -- a laugh such as one hears on the stage . 
Someone -- it sounded like Speranski -- was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha . 
Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski 's famous laugh , and this ringing , high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him . 
He entered the dining room . 
The whole company were standing between two windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres . 
Speranski , wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast , and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the Council of State , stood at the table with a beaming countenance . 
His guests surrounded him . 
Magnitski , addressing himself to Speranski , was relating an anecdote , and Speranski was laughing in advance at what Magnitski was going to say . 
When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnitski 's words were again crowned by laughter . 
Stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese .
