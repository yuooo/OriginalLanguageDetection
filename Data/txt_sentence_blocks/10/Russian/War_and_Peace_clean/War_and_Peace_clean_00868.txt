He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders -- Bekleshev and Naryshkin -- which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign . 
Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room , according to their rank and importance : the more important nearer to the honored guest , as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest . 
Just before dinner , Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to Bagration , who recognized him and said a few words to him , disjointed and awkward , as were all the words he spoke that day , and Count Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son . 
Nicholas Rostov , with Denisov and his new acquaintance , Dolokhov , sat almost at the middle of the table . 
Facing them sat Pierre , beside Prince Nesvitski . 
Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of the committee sat facing Bagration and , as the very personification of Moscow hospitality , did the honors to the prince . 
His efforts had not been in vain . 
The dinner , both the Lenten and the other fare , was splendid , yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the meal . 
He winked at the butler , whispered directions to the footmen , and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety . 
Everything was excellent .
