It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry . 
They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the French . 
However inconvenient the position , it was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves . 
The squadron in which Rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy . 
Again , as at the Enns bridge , there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy , and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear - resembling the line separating the living from the dead -- lay between them . 
All were conscious of this unseen line , and the question whether they would cross it or not , and how they would cross it , agitated them all . 
The colonel rode to the front , angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers , and , like a man desperately insisting on having his own way , gave an order . 
No one said anything definite , but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron . 
The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards . 
Still no one moved .
