cried Natasha , with one hand bolding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face , while with the other she pressed down the carpets . 
`` Now press , Petya ! 
Press , Vasilich , press hard ! '' 
she cried . 
The carpets yielded and the lid closed ; Natasha , clapping her hands , screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes . 
But this only lasted a moment . 
She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely . 
The count was not angry even when they told him that Natasha had countermanded an order of his , and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded , and whether it might be corded up . 
Thanks to Natasha 's directions the work now went on expeditiously , unnecessary things were left , and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible . 
But hard as they all worked till quite late that night , they could not get everything packed .
