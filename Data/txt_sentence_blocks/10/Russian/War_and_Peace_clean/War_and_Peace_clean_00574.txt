Anna Pavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy , evidently relating to the young man 's recent loss by the death of Count Bezukhov -LRB- everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known -RRB- , and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Marya Fedorovna . 
Pierre felt flattered by this . 
Anna Pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill . 
The large group , in which were Prince Vasili and the generals , had the benefit of the diplomat . 
Another group was at the tea table . 
Pierre wished to join the former , but Anna Pavlovna -- who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action -- seeing Pierre , touched his sleeve with her finger , saying : `` Wait a bit , I have something in view for you this evening . '' 
-LRB- She glanced at Helene and smiled at her . -RRB- 
`` My dear Helene , be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you . 
Go and keep her company for ten minutes . 
And that it will not be too dull , here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you . ''
