Catherine the Great could not have done more , '' said Napoleon , growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room , repeating to Balashev almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit . 
`` All that , he would have owed to my friendship . 
Oh , what a splendid reign ! '' 
he repeated several times , then paused , drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox , lifted it to his nose , and greedily sniffed at it . 
`` What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander 's might have been ! '' 
He looked compassionately at Balashev , and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him . 
`` What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship ? '' 
demanded Napoleon , shrugging his shoulders in perplexity . 
`` But no , he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies , and with whom ? 
With Steins , Armfeldts , Bennigsens , and Wintzingerodes !
