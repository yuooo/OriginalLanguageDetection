said Pierre , as if suddenly struck by a happy thought , `` seriously , I have long been thinking of it ... . 
Leading such a life I ca n't decide or think properly about anything . 
One 's head aches , and one spends all one 's money . 
He asked me for tonight , but I wo n't go . '' 
`` You give me your word of honor not to go ? '' 
`` On my honor ! '' 
It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend . 
It was a cloudless , northern , summer night . 
Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home . 
But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night .
