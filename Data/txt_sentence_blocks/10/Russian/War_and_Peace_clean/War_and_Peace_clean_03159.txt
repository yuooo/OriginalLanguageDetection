History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to everyone . 
But in spite of every desire to regard it as known , anyone reading many historical works can not help doubting whether this new force , so variously understood by the historians themselves , is really quite well known to everybody . 
What force moves the nations ? 
Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers . 
In their narration events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon , and Alexander , or in general of the persons they describe . 
The answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event . 
As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event , the replies they give immediately lose all meaning , for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways . 
One historian says that an event was produced by Napoleon 's power , another that it was produced by Alexander 's , a third that it was due to the power of some other person . 
Besides this , historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based . 
Thiers , a Bonapartist , says that Napoleon 's power was based on his virtue and genius .
