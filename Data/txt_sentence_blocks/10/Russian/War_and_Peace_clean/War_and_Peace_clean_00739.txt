suggested another voice . 
Prince Andrew , however , did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs . 
The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone . 
Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov 's staff , but he does everything alone . 
The next battle is won by him alone . 
Kutuzov is removed and he is appointed ... `` Well and then ? '' 
asked the other voice . 
`` If before that you are not ten times wounded , killed , or betrayed , well ... what then ? 
... '' `` Well then , '' Prince Andrew answered himself , `` I do n't know what will happen and do n't want to know , and ca n't , but if I want this -- want glory , want to be known to men , want to be loved by them , it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only for that . 
Yes , for that alone !
