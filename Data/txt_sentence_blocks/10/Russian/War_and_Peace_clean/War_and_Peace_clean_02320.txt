`` Dunyasha , you pack ! 
You will , wo n't you , dear ? '' 
And when Dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her , Natasha sat down on the floor , took her old ball dress , and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now . 
She was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room -LRB- which was theirs -RRB- and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch . 
Natasha got up and looked out of the window . 
An enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street . 
The housekeeper , the old nurse , the cooks , coachmen , maids , footmen , postilions , and scullions stood at the gate , staring at the wounded . 
Natasha , throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand , went out into the street . 
The former housekeeper , old Mavra Kuzminichna , had stepped out of the crowd by the gate , gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats , and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside . 
Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly , still holding her handkerchief , and listened to what the housekeeper was saying .
