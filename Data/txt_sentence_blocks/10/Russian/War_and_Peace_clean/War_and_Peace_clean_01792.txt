Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests , arguments , and passions at headquarters . 
For the Pavlograd hussars , however , the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business . 
It was only at headquarters that there was depression , uneasiness , and intriguing ; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why . 
If they regretted having to retreat , it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to , or some pretty young Polish lady . 
If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone 's head , he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs , but only of the task nearest to hand . 
First they camped gaily before Vilna , making acquaintance with the Polish landowners , preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders . 
Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them . 
Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp , a name the whole army gave to their encampment there , and because many complaints were made against the troops , who , taking advantage of the order to collect provisions , took also horses , carriages , and carpets from the Polish proprietors . 
Rostov remembered Sventsyani , because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who , unknown to him , had appropriated five barrels of old beer . 
From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to Drissa , and thence again beyond Drissa , drawing near to the frontier of Russia proper .
