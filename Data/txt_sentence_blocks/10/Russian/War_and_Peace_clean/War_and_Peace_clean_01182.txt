Look at those cramped dead firs , ever the same , and at me too , sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown , whether from my back or my sides : as they have grown so I stand , and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies . '' 
As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look at that oak , as if expecting something from it . 
Under the oak , too , were flowers and grass , but it stood among them scowling , rigid , misshapen , and grim as ever . 
`` Yes , the oak is right , a thousand times right , '' thought Prince Andrew . 
`` Let others -- the young -- yield afresh to that fraud , but we know life , our life is finished ! '' 
A whole sequence of new thoughts , hopeless but mournfully pleasant , rose in his soul in connection with that tree . 
During this journey he , as it were , considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion , restful in its hopelessness : that it was not for him to begin anything anew -- but that he must live out his life , content to do no harm , and not disturbing himself or desiring anything . 
Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of which he was trustee . 
This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov , and in the middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him . 
It was now hot spring weather .
