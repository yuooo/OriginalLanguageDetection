Whence came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being ? 
didst thou , and why did the whole world , conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being , a Being all-powerful , eternal , and infinite in all His attributes ? 
... '' He stopped and remained silent for a long time . 
Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence . 
`` He exists , but to understand Him is hard , '' the Mason began again , looking not at Pierre but straight before him , and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still . 
`` If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee , could take him by the hand and show him to thee . 
But how can I , an insignificant mortal , show His omnipotence , His infinity , and all His mercy to one who is blind , or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness ? '' 
He paused again . 
`` Who art thou ? 
Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words , '' he went on , with a somber and scornful smile .
