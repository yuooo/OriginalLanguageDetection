When she saw his Russian face , and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class , she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion . 
This meeting immediately struck Rostov as a romantic event . 
`` A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief , left to the mercy of coarse , rioting peasants ! 
And what a strange fate sent me here ! 
What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression ! '' 
thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story . 
When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father 's funeral , her voiced trembled . 
She turned away , and then , as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity , looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry . 
There were tears in Rostov 's eyes . 
Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten .
