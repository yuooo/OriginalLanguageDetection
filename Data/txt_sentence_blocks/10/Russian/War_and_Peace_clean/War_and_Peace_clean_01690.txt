he said , moving toward Anatole . 
Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook . 
Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and , pushing aside a table that stood in his way , threw himself on the sofa . 
`` I sha n't be violent , do n't be afraid ! '' 
said Pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of Anatole 's . 
`` First , the letters , '' said he , as if repeating a lesson to himself . 
`` Secondly , '' he continued after a short pause , again rising and again pacing the room , `` tomorrow you must get out of Moscow . '' 
`` But how can I ? 
... '' `` Thirdly , '' Pierre continued without listening to him , `` you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostova .
