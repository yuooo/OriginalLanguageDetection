They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room . 
The scent of flowers came in at the window . 
Helene was wearing a white dress , transparent over her shoulders and bosom . 
The abbe , a well-fed man with a plump , clean-shaven chin , a pleasant firm mouth , and white hands meekly folded on his knees , sat close to Helene and , with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty , occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject . 
Helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump , clean-shaven , blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn . 
But the abbe , though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion , was absorbed in his mastery of the matter . 
The course of the Father Confessor 's arguments ran as follows : `` Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking , you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part , by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage , committed an act of sacrilege . 
That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had . 
Yet in spite of this your vow was binding . 
You swerved from it .
