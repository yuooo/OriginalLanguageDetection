`` They 've brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything ! 
... There it is again , do you hear ? '' 
said he , pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing . 
`` They 've brought us all to ruin ... the brigands ! '' 
he repeated , and descended the porch steps . 
Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs . 
In the waiting room were tradesmen , women , and officials , looking silently at one another . 
The door of the Governor 's room opened and they all rose and moved forward . 
An official ran out , said some words to a merchant , called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him , and vanished again , evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him .
