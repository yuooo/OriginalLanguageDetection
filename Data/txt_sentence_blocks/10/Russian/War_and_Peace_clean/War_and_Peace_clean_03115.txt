Nicholas and Denisov rose , asked for their pipes , smoked , went to fetch more tea from Sonya -- who sat weary but resolute at the samovar -- and questioned Pierre . 
The curly-headed , delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner , starting every now and then and muttering something to himself , and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head , with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar , toward the place where Pierre sat . 
The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power , in which most people see the chief interest of home politics . 
Denisov , dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service , heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid , and made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them . 
`` One used to have to be a German -- now one must dance with Tatawinova and Madame Kwudener , and wead Ecka ` tshausen and the bwethwen . 
Oh , they should let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose -- he 'd knock all this nonsense out of them ! 
Fancy giving the command of the Semenov wegiment to a fellow like that Schwa ` tz ! '' 
he cried . 
Nicholas , though free from Denisov 's readiness to find fault with everything , also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter , and the fact that A had been appointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That , and that the Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so , seemed to him very important .
