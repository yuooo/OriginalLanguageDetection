Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian . 
`` Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children , '' she said , in her loud , full-toned voice which drowned all others . 
`` Well , you old sinner , '' she went on , turning to the count who was kissing her hand , `` you 're feeling dull in Moscow , I daresay ? 
Nowhere to hunt with your dogs ? 
But what is to be done , old man ? 
Just see how these nestlings are growing up , '' and she pointed to the girls . 
`` You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not ... '' `` Well , '' said she , `` how 's my Cossack ? '' 
-LRB- Marya Dmitrievna always called Natasha a Cossack -RRB- and she stroked the child 's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand . 
`` I know she 's a scamp of a girl , but I like her . '' 
She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and , having given them to the rosy Natasha , who beamed with the pleasure of her saint 's - day fete , turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre .
