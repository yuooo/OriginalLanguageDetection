The count had devised this diplomatic ruse -LRB- as he afterwards told his daughter -RRB- to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one another freely , but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince , of whom he was afraid . 
He did not mention this to his daughter , but Natasha noticed her father 's nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it . 
She blushed for him , grew still angrier at having blushed , and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody . 
The princess told the count that she would be delighted , and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Semenovna 's , and he departed . 
Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary -- who wished to have a tete-a-tete with Natasha -- Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters . 
Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom , by her father 's nervousness , and by the unnatural manner of the princess who -- she thought -- was making a favor of receiving her , and so everything displeased her . 
She did not like Princess Mary , whom she thought very plain , affected , and dry . 
Natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more . 
After five minutes of irksome , constrained conversation , they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching . 
Princess Mary looked frightened .
