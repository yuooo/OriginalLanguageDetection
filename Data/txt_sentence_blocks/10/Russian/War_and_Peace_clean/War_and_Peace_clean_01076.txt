he asked . 
`` Bad ! 
Bad ! ''

`` We all know what is bad for ourselves . '' 
`` Yes , we know that , but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I can not inflict on others , '' said Prince Andrew , growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre . 
He spoke in French . 
`` I only know two very real evils in life : remorse and illness . 
The only good is the absence of those evils .
