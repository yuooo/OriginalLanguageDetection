`` Hm ... . 
If you wish to kill him , to kill him outright , you can see him ... Olga , go and see whether Uncle 's beef tea is ready -- it is almost time , '' she added , giving Pierre to understand that they were busy , and busy making his father comfortable , while evidently he , Pierre , was only busy causing him annoyance . 
Olga went out . 
Pierre stood looking at the sisters ; then he bowed and said : `` Then I will go to my rooms . 
You will let me know when I can see him . '' 
And he left the room , followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole . 
Next day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count 's house . 
He sent for Pierre and said to him : `` My dear fellow , if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg , you will end very badly ; that is all I have to say to you . 
The count is very , very ill , and you must not see him at all . '' 
Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs .
