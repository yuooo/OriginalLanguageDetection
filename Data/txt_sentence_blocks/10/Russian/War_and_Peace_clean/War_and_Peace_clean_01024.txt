A bass voice -LRB- Pierre was still blindfold -RRB- questioned him as to who he was , when and where he was born , and so on . 
Then he was again led somewhere still blindfold , and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage , of holy friendship , of the Eternal Architect of the universe , and of the courage with which he should endure toils and dangers . 
During these wanderings , Pierre noticed that he was spoken of now as the `` Seeker , '' now as the `` Sufferer , '' and now as the `` Postulant , '' to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords . 
As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors . 
He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet . 
After that they took his right hand , placed it on something , and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order . 
The candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted , as Pierre knew by the smell , and he was told that he would now see the lesser light . 
The bandage was taken off his eyes and , by the faint light of the burning spirit , Pierre , as in a dream , saw several men standing before him , wearing aprons like the Rhetor 's and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast . 
Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood . 
On seeing this , Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords , meaning them to pierce it .
