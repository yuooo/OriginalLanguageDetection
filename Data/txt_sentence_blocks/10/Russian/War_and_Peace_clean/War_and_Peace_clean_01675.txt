asked the count . 
After a moment 's silence Natasha answered : `` Yes , ill . '' 
In reply to the count 's anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed , she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry . 
Marya Dmitrievna confirmed Natasha 's assurances that nothing had happened . 
From the pretense of illness , from his daughter 's distress , and by the embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna , the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence , but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter , and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity , that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened ; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country . 
From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go away somewhere , so as not to be near her . 
Soon after the Rostovs came to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention . 
He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich 's widow , who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband 's . 
When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed . 
Pierre had been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married man 's should be for his friend 's fiancee .
