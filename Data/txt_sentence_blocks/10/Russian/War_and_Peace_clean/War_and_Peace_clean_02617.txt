But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout . 
Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought , and began buttoning up his uniform . 
It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre . 
When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner , he jerked his head in Pierre 's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away . 
But where they were to take him Pierre did not know : back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin 's Field . 
He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to Davout . 
`` Yes , of course ! '' 
replied Davout , but what this `` yes '' meant , Pierre did not know . 
Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went , whether it was far , or in which direction . 
His faculties were quite numbed , he was stupefied , and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too .
