`` Oh , you are there ! '' 
said Sonya with a start , and came near and listened . 
`` I do n't know . 
A storm ? '' 
she ventured timidly , afraid of being wrong . 
`` There ! 
That 's just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before , '' thought Natasha , `` and in just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her . '' 
`` No , it 's the chorus from The Water-Carrier , listen ! '' 
and Natasha sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it . 
`` Where were you going ? ''
