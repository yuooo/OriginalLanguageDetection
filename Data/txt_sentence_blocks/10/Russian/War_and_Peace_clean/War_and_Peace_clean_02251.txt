And , indeed , human reason replies : every time conquerors appear there have been wars , but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man . 
Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten , I hear the bells of the neighboring church ; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten , I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch . 
Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning ; but I have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine . 
The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding , and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding . 
But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold , I can not agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind , for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds . 
I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life , and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the hands of the watch , and the valves and wheels of the engine , and the oak , I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing , the engine moving , or of the winds of spring . 
To that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam , of the bells , and of the wind . 
History must do the same . 
And attempts in this direction have already been made . 
To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation , must leave aside kings , ministers , and generals , and the common , infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved .
