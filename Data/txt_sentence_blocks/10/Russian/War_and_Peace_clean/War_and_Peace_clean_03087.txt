A husband was given her and he gave her a family . 
And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband , but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family , she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different . 
Natasha did not care for society in general , but prized the more the society of her relatives -- Countess Mary , and her brother , her mother , and Sonya . 
She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown , and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby 's napkin , and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better . 
To such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair , her ill-chosen words , and her jealousy - she was jealous of Sonya , of the governess , and of every woman , pretty or plain -- were habitual subjects of jest to those about her . 
The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife 's thumb , which was really true . 
From the very first days of their married life Natasha had announced her demands . 
Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife 's view , to him a perfectly novel one , that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family . 
His wife 's demands astonished him , but they also flattered him , and he submitted to them . 
Pierre 's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with , but dared not even speak smilingly to , any other woman ; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime , did not dare spend money a whim , and did not dare absent himself for any length of time , except on business -- in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits , which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance .
