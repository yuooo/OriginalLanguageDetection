he cried , raising his voice higher and higher . 
Count Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on Vereshchagin . 
He turned away . 
`` Go fas ... faster ! '' 
he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman . 
The caleche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it , but for a long time Count Rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance , while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished , frightened , bloodstained face of `` the traitor '' in the fur-lined coat . 
Recent as that mental picture was , Rostopchin already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood . 
Even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time , but that the terrible memory would , on the contrary , dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life . 
He seemed still to hear the sound of his own words : `` Cut him down ! 
I command it ... '' `` Why did I utter those words ?
