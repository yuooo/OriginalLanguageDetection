`` I go by myself , benefactor , '' said Ivanushka , trying to speak in a bass voice . 
`` I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo ... '' Pelageya interrupted her companion ; she evidently wished to tell what she had seen . 
`` In Kolyazin , master , a wonderful blessing has been revealed . '' 
`` What is it ? 
Some new relics ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` Andrew , do leave off , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Do n't tell him , Pelageya . '' 
`` No ... why not , my dear , why should n't I ?
