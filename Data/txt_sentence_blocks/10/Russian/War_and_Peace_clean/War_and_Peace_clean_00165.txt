`` Well , my boy , you 'll get along wherever you go -- foot or horse -- that I 'll warrant , '' said Shinshin , patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa . 
Berg smiled joyously . 
The count , by his guests , went into the drawing room . 
It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests , expecting the summons to zakuska , * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk , in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food . 
The host and hostess look toward the door , and now and then glance at one another , and the visitors try to guess from these glances who , or what , they are waiting for -- some important relation who has not yet arrived , or a dish that is not yet ready . 
* Hors d'oeuvres . 
Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across , blocking the way for everyone . 
The countess tried to make him talk , but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables . 
He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact . 
Most of the guests , knowing of the affair with the bear , looked with curiosity at this big , stout , quiet man , wondering how such a clumsy , modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman .
