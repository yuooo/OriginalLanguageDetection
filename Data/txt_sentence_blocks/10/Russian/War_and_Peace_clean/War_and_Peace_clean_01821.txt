What would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time ! 
But it was gone forever . 
Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her -- that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again . 
Yet it was necessary to live on . 
It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined , but worse , much worse , than anybody else in the world . 
But this was not enough . 
She knew that , and asked herself , `` What next ? '' 
But there was nothing to come . 
There was no joy in life , yet life was passing . 
Natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone , but wanted nothing for herself .
