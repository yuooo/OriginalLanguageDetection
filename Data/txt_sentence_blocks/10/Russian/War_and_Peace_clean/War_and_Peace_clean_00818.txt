remarked Napoleon , looking at a dead Russian grenadier , who , with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape , lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide . 
`` The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted , Your Majesty , '' said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd . 
`` Have some brought from the reserve , '' said Napoleon , and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew , who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him . 
-LRB- The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy . -RRB- 
`` That 's a fine death ! '' 
said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski . 
Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it . 
He heard the speaker addressed as Sire . 
But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly . 
Not only did they not interest him , but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them .
