`` You are mad , I tell you . 
I wo n't allow it . 
The purse is here ! 
I 'll flay this scoundwel alive , and it will be found . '' 
`` I know who has taken it , '' repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice , and went to the door . 
`` And I tell you , do n't you dahe to do it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , rushing at the cadet to restrain him . 
But Rostov pulled away his arm and , with as much anger as though Denisov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face . 
`` Do you understand what you 're saying ? '' 
he said in a trembling voice .
