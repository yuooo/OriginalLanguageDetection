But well as he knew it , Pierre now listened to that tale as to something new , and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre . 
The story was of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family , and who went once to the Nizhni fair with a companion -- a rich merchant . 
Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep , and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut . 
A bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant 's pillow . 
He was tried , knouted , and his nostrils having been torn off , `` all in due form '' as Karataev put it , he was sent to hard labor in Siberia . 
`` And so , brother '' -LRB- it was at this point that Pierre came up -RRB- , `` ten years or more passed by . 
The old man was living as a convict , submitting as he should and doing no wrong . 
Only he prayed to God for death . 
Well , one night the convicts were gathered just as we are , with the old man among them . 
And they began telling what each was suffering for , and how they had sinned against God .
