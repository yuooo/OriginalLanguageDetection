It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying , but could not . 
The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms , dreams , and hopes of happiness or goodness , in Prince Andrew 's presence . 
He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views , which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour . 
He checked himself , fearing to seem naive , yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different , and better , Pierre than he had been in Petersburg . 
`` I ca n't tell you how much I have lived through since then . 
I hardly know myself again . '' 
`` Yes , we have altered much , very much , since then , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you ? 
What are your plans ? '' 
`` Plans ! ''
