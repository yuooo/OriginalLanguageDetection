And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostov 's soul in all its old force . 
In the uniform of the Preobrazhensk regiment -- white chamois-leather breeches and high boots -- and wearing a star Rostov did not know -LRB- it was that of the Legion d'honneur -RRB- , the monarch came out into the porch , putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm . 
He stopped and looked about him , brightening everything around by his glance . 
He spoke a few words to some of the generals , and , recognizing the former commander of Rostov 's division , smiled and beckoned to him . 
All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking for some time to the Emperor . 
The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse . 
Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers -LRB- among whom was Rostov -RRB- moved nearer to the Emperor . 
Stopping beside his horse , with his hand on the saddle , the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice , evidently wishing to be heard by all : `` I can not do it , General . 
I can not , because the law is stronger than I , '' and he raised his foot to the stirrup . 
The general bowed his head respectfully , and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop .
