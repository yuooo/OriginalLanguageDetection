From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade , Prince Andrew 's father . 
Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry , firmness , and expedition . 
I consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me . 
On Kutuzov 's staff , among his fellow officers and in the army generally , Prince Andrew had , as he had had in Petersburg society , two quite opposite reputations . 
Some , a minority , acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else , expected great things of him , listened to him , admired , and imitated him , and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant . 
Others , the majority , disliked him and considered him conceited , cold , and disagreeable . 
But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him . 
Coming out of Kutuzov 's room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade , the aide-de-camp on duty , Kozlovski , who was sitting at the window with a book . 
`` Well , Prince ? '' 
asked Kozlovski .
