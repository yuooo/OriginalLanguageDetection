He cast happy , sidelong glances at his son from under his thick , bushy eyebrows . 
Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him . 
He made no reply on his father 's favorite topic -- making fun of the military men of the day , and more particularly of Bonaparte . 
`` Yes , Father , I have come come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant , '' said Prince Andrew , following every movement of his father 's face with an eager and respectful look . 
`` How is your health ? '' 
`` Only fools and rakes fall ill , my boy . 
You know me : I am busy from morning till night and abstemious , so of course I am well . '' 
`` Thank God , '' said his son smiling . 
`` God has nothing to do with it ! 
Well , go on , '' he continued , returning to his hobby ; `` tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ` strategy . ' ''
