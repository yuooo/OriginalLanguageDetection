The Emperor Francis , a rosy , long faced young man , sat very erect on his handsome black horse , looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner . 
He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question -- `` Most likely he is asking at what o'clock they started , '' thought Prince Andrew , watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brunn . 
In the Emperors ' suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments , Russian and Austrian . 
Among them were grooms leading the Tsar 's beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths . 
As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room , so a whiff of youthfulness , energy , and confidence of success reached Kutuzov 's cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men . 
`` Why are n't you beginning , Michael Ilarionovich ? '' 
said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzov , glancing courteously at the same time at the Emperor Francis . 
`` I am waiting , Your Majesty , '' answered Kutuzov , bending forward respectfully . 
The Emperor , frowning slightly , bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard . 
`` Waiting , Your Majesty , '' repeated Kutuzov .
