puff ! '' 
-- and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together ; and `` boom , boom ! '' 
came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen . 
Pierre glanced round at the first cloud , which he had seen as a round compact ball , and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side , and -- `` puff '' -LRB- with a pause -RRB- -- `` puff , puff ! '' 
three and then four more appeared and then from each , with the same interval -- `` boom -- boom , boom ! '' 
came the fine , firm , precise sounds in reply . 
It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods , fields , and glittering bayonets ran past them . 
From the left , over fields and bushes , those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports , while nearer still , in the hollows and woods , there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls , but had their little echoes in just the same way . 
`` Trakh-ta-ta-takh ! '' 
came the frequent crackle of musketry , but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon .
