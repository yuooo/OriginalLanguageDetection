But before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who , stumbling , tripping up , and shouting , ran merrily and wildly toward the battery . 
-LRB- This was the attack for which Ermolov claimed the credit , declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible : it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George 's Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there . -RRB- 
The French who had occupied the battery fled , and our troops shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call them back . 
The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a wounded French general , whom the officers surrounded . 
Crowds of wounded -- some known to Pierre and some unknown -- Russians and French , with faces distorted by suffering , walked , crawled , and were carried on stretchers from the battery . 
Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour , and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not find a single one . 
There were many dead whom he did not know , but some he recognized . 
The young officer still sat in the same way , bent double , in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall . 
The red-faced man was still twitching , but they did not carry him away .
