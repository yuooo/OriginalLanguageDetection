Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable . 
To understand , observe , and draw conclusions , man must first of all be conscious of himself as living . 
A man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills , that is , is conscious of his volition . 
But his will -- which forms the essence of his life -- man recognizes -LRB- and can but recognize -RRB- as free . 
If , observing himself , man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law -LRB- whether he observes the necessity of taking food , using his brain , or anything else -RRB- he can not recognize this never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it . 
Were it not free it could not be limited . 
A man 's will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free . 
You say : I am not and am not free . 
But I have lifted my hand and let it fall . 
Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom .
