`` Oh , very well , you may stay in attendance on me . '' 
`` Count Ilya Rostov 's son ? '' 
asked Dolgorukov . 
But Rostov did not reply . 
`` Then I may reckon on it , your excellency ? '' 
`` I will give the order . '' 
`` Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor , '' thought Rostov . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
The fires and shouting in the enemy 's army were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleon 's proclamation was being read to the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs . 
The soldiers , on seeing him , lit wisps of straw and ran after him , shouting , `` Vive l'Empereur ! ''
