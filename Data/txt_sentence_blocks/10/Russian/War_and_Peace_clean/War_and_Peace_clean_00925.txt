He went into his wife 's room . 
She was lying dead , in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and , despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks , the same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair . 
`` I love you all , and have done no harm to anyone ; and what have you done to me ? '' 
-- said her charming , pathetic , dead face . 
In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed in Mary Bogdanovna 's trembling white hands . 
Two hours later Prince Andrew , stepping softly , went into his father 's room . 
The old man already knew everything . 
He was standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son 's neck , and without a word he began to sob like a child . 
Three days later the little princess was buried , and Prince Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood , to give her the farewell kiss . 
And there in the coffin was the same face , though with closed eyes .
