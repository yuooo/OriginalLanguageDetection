He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness . 
The few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design . 
The pistol , dagger , and peasant coat were ready .

Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer , but now he felt that he would not do it . 
He did not know why , but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention . 
He struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind , concerning vengeance , killing , and self-sacrifice , had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met .
