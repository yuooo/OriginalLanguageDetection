The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow nobility and gentry , that they would furnish ten men , fully equipped , out of every thousand serfs , as the Smolensk gentry had done . 
Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief , and began walking up and down , arm in arm , to stretch their legs and converse in couples . 
`` The Emperor ! 
The Emperor ! '' 
a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance . 
The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles . 
Every face expressed respectful , awe-struck curiosity . 
Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said . 
From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility . 
He was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at .
