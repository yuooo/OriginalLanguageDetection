Anatole consented and went to Moscow , where he put up at Pierre 's house . 
Pierre received him unwillingly at first , but got used to him after a while , sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals , and gave him money under the guise of loans . 
As Shinshin had remarked , from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies , especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French actresses -- with the chief of whom , Mademoiselle George , he was said to be on intimate relations . 
He had never missed a carousal at Danilov 's or other Moscow revelers ' , drank whole nights through , outvying everyone else , and was at all the balls and parties of the best society . 
There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies , and he flirted with a few of them at the balls . 
But he did not run after the unmarried girls , especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain . 
There was a special reason for this , as he had got married two years before -- a fact known only to his most intimate friends . 
At that time while with his regiment in Poland , a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter . 
Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and , for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law , had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor . 
Anatole was always content with his position , with himself , and with others .
