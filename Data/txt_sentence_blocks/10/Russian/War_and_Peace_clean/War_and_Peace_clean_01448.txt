`` Sit down with me a little , '' said the countess . 
`` Mamma , I want him . 
Why should I be wasted like this , Mamma ? '' 
Her voice broke , tears gushed from her eyes , and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room . 
She passed into the sitting room , stood there thinking awhile , and then went into the maids ' room . 
There an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting , having just run in through the cold from the serfs ' quarters . 
`` Stop playing -- there 's a time for everything , '' said the old woman . 
`` Let her alone , Kondratevna , '' said Natasha . 
`` Go , Mavrushka , go . '' 
Having released Mavrushka , Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule .
