The fourth column , with which Kutuzov was , stood on the Pratzen Heights . 
Below , where the fight was beginning , there was still thick fog ; on the higher ground it was clearing , but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front . 
Whether all the enemy forces were , as we supposed , six miles away , or whether they were near by in that sea of mist , no one knew till after eight o'clock . 
It was nine o'clock in the morning . 
The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below , but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him , it was quite light . 
Above him was a clear blue sky , and the sun 's vast orb quivered like a huge hollow , crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist . 
The whole French army , and even Napoleon himself with his staff , were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action , but were on this side , so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot . 
Napoleon , in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign , sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals . 
He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance , and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley . 
Not a single muscle of his face -- which in those days was still thin -- moved .
