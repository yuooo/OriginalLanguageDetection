We 're lost ! '' 
shouted the fugitives . 
The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind , the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment , and the thought that he , an exemplary officer of many years ' service who had never been to blame , might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that , forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel , his own dignity as a general , and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation , he clutched the crupper of his saddle and , spurring his horse , galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around , but fortunately missed him . 
His one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct , or remedy , the mistake if he had made one , so that he , an exemplary officer of twenty-two years ' service , who had never been censured , should not be held to blame . 
Having galloped safely through the French , he reached a field behind the copse across which our men , regardless of orders , were running and descending the valley . 
That moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived . 
Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander , or would they , disregarding him , continue their flight ? 
Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers , despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self , and the flourishing of his saber , the soldiers all continued to run , talking , firing into the air , and disobeying orders . 
The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic . 
The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair .
