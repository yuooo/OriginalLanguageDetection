The princess stopped . 
Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd . 
`` I am not doing this on my own account , '' she continued , `` I do it in the name of my dead father , who was a good master to you , and of my brother and his son . '' 
Again she paused . 
No one broke the silence . 
`` Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together . 
All that is mine is yours , '' she concluded , scanning the faces before her . 
All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression . 
She could not fathom whether it was curiosity , devotion , gratitude , or apprehension and distrust -- but the expression on all the faces was identical . 
`` We are all very thankful for your bounty , but it wo n't do for us to take the landlord 's grain , '' said a voice at the back of the crowd .
