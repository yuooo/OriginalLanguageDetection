He blushed hotly , raised his eyes to hers , and said : `` You know my feelings for you ! '' 
There was no need to say more : Julie 's face shone with triumph and self-satisfaction ; but she forced Boris to say all that is said on such occasions -- that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her . 
She knew that for the Penza estates and Nizhegorod forests she could demand this , and she received what she demanded . 
The affianced couple , no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them , planned the arrangements of a splendid house in Petersburg , paid calls , and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding . 
At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with Natasha and Sonya . 
The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery . 
Prince Andrew was expected in Moscow any day , the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near Moscow had to be sold , besides which the opportunity of presenting his future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in Moscow could not be missed . 
The Rostovs ' Moscow house had not been heated that winter and , as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them , the count decided to stay with Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova , who had long been pressing her hospitality on them . 
Late one evening the Rostovs ' four sleighs drove into Marya Dmitrievna 's courtyard in the old Konyusheny street . 
Marya Dmitrievna lived alone .
