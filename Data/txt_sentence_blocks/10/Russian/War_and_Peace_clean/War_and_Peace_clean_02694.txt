`` Why , there , over at Echkino , '' said a Cossack officer , pointing to a country house in the far distance . 
`` What , outside our line ? '' 
`` They 've put two regiments as outposts , and they 're having such a spree there , it 's awful ! 
Two bands and three sets of singers ! '' 
The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino . 
While still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier 's dance song proceeding from the house . 
`` In the meadows ... in the meadows ! '' 
he heard , accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban , drowned every now and then by shouts . 
These sounds made his spirits rise , but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him . 
It was already past eight o'clock .
