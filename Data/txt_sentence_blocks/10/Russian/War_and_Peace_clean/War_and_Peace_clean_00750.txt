Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy 's camp . 
Rostov rode up to Bagration , reported to him , and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying . 
`` Believe me , '' said Prince Dolgorukov , addressing Bagration , `` it is nothing but a trick ! 
He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us . '' 
`` Hardly , '' said Bagration . 
`` I saw them this evening on that knoll ; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too ... . 
Officer ! '' 
said Bagration to Rostov , `` are the enemy 's skirmishers still there ? '' 
`` They were there this evening , but now I do n't know , your excellency . 
Shall I go with some of my hussars to see ? ''
