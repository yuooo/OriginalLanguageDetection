`` I am glad ... . 
Are you here on leave ? '' 
he went on in his usual tone of indifference . 
`` I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment , your excellency , '' replied Boris , betraying neither annoyance at the prince 's brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation , but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance . 
`` Are you living with your mother ? '' 
`` I am living at Countess Rostova 's , '' replied Boris , again adding , `` your excellency . '' 
`` That is , with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna . 
`` I know , I know , '' answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice . 
`` I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear ! 
A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow , and a gambler too , I am told . ''
