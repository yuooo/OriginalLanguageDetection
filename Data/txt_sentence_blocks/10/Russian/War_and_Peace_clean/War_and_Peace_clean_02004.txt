But as if this angered him , he bent his head quite low and muttered : `` Why should we agree ? 
We do n't want the grain . '' 
`` Why should we give up everything ? 
We do n't agree . 
Do n't agree ... . 
We are sorry for you , but we 're not willing . 
Go away yourself , alone ... '' came from various sides of the crowd . 
And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression , though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude , but of angry resolve . 
`` But you ca n't have understood me , '' said Princess Mary with a sad smile .
