The two girls in their white dresses , each with a rose in her black hair , both curtsied in the same way , but the hostess ' eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha . 
She looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess . 
Looking at her she may have recalled the golden , irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball . 
The host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter . 
`` Charming ! '' 
said he , kissing the tips of his fingers . 
In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the Emperor . 
The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd . 
Natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her . 
She realized that those noticing her liked her , and this observation helped to calm her .
