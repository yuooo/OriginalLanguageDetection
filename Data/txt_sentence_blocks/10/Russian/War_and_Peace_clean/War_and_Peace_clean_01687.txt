The countess ' drawing room was full of guests . 
Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return -- at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever - entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him . 
`` Ah , Pierre , '' said the countess going up to her husband . 
`` You do n't know what a plight our Anatole ... '' She stopped , seeing in the forward thrust of her husband 's head , in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait , the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with Dolokhov . 
`` Where you are , there is vice and evil ! '' 
said Pierre to his wife . 
`` Anatole , come with me ! 
I must speak to you , '' he added in French . 
Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively , ready to follow Pierre . 
Pierre , taking him by the arm , pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room .
