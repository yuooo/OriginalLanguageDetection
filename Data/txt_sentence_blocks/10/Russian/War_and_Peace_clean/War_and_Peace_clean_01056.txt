Get along with you ! ' 
So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen : ' I am wounded and can not ride and consequently can not command the army . 
You have brought your army corps to Pultusk , routed : here it is exposed , and without fuel or forage , so something must be done , and , as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday , you must think of retreating to our frontier -- which do today . ' '' 
` From all my riding , ' he writes to the Emperor , ' I have got a saddle sore which , coming after all my previous journeys , quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army , so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority , Count Buxhowden , having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it , advising him if there is a lack of bread , to move farther into the interior of Prussia , for only one day 's ration of bread remains , and in some regiments none at all , as reported by the division commanders , Ostermann and Sedmoretzki , and all that the peasants had has been eaten up . 
I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover . 
In regard to which I humbly submit my report , with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring . '' 
` Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen . 
I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital , that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army . 
My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir -- a blind man has left it . 
There are thousands such as I in Russia . '
