Her pretty little upper lip , on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible , was too short for her teeth , but it lifted all the more sweetly , and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip . 
As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman , her defect -- the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth -- seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty . 
Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman , so soon to become a mother , so full of life and health , and carrying her burden so lightly . 
Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her , after being in her company and talking to her a little while , felt as if they too were becoming , like her , full of life and health . 
All who talked to her , and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth , thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day . 
The little princess went round the table with quick , short , swaying steps , her workbag on her arm , and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar , as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her . 
`` I have brought my work , '' said she in French , displaying her bag and addressing all present . 
`` Mind , Annette , I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me , '' she added , turning to her hostess . 
`` You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception , and just see how badly I am dressed . '' 
And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted , lace-trimmed , dainty gray dress , girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast .
