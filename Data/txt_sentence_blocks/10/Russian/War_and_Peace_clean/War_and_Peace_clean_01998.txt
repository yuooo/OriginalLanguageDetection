`` Discharge me , little mother , for God 's sake ! 
Order the keys to be taken from me , '' said he . 
`` I have served twenty-three years and have done no wrong . 
Discharge me , for God 's sake ! '' 
Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged . 
She replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants . 
An hour later Dunyasha came to tell the princess that Dron had come , and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess ' order and wished to have word with their mistress . 
`` But I never told them to come , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` I only told Dron to let them have the grain . '' 
`` Only , for God 's sake , Princess dear , have them sent away and do n't go out to them .
