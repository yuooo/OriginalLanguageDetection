The group of prisoners had melted away most of all . 
Of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now remained . 
The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or Junot 's baggage . 
They understood that the saddles and Junot 's spoon might be of some use , but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who froze and lagged behind on the road -LRB- in which case the order was to shoot them -RRB- was not merely incomprehensible but revolting . 
And the escort , as if afraid , in the grievous condition they themselves were in , of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse , treated them with particular moroseness and severity . 
At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy , after locking the prisoners in a stable , had gone off to pillage their own stores , several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away , but were recaptured by the French and shot . 
The arrangement adopted when they started , that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest , had long since been abandoned . 
All who could walk went together , and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karataev for its master . 
On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow , and as he grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him . 
Pierre did not know why , but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him .
