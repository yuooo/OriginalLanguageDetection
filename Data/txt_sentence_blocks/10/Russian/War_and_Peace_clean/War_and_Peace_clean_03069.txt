Like a cat , she had attached herself not to the people but to the home . 
She waited on the old countess , petted and spoiled the children , was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift , and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude . 
The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt , though not on the same scale as under the old prince . 
The buildings , begun under straitened circumstances , were more than simple . 
The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood , plastered only inside . 
It had bare deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas , armchairs , tables , and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood . 
The house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors . 
Whole families of the Rostovs ' and Bolkonskis ' relations sometimes came to Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months . 
Besides that , four times a year , on the name days and birthdays of the hosts , as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two . 
The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations , and its breakfasts , lunches , dinners , and suppers , provided out of the produce of the estate .
