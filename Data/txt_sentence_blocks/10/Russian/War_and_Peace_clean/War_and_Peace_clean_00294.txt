It was an autumn night , so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole . 
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch . 
The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows . 
The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall , waiting to bid good-by to the young prince . 
The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall : Michael Ivanovich , Mademoiselle Bourienne , Princess Mary , and the little princess . 
Prince Andrew had been called to his father 's study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone . 
All were waiting for them to come out . 
When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown , in which he received no one but his son , sat at the table writing . 
He glanced round . 
`` Going ? ''
