`` Heavens ! 
I was quite forgetting ! '' 
he suddenly cried . 
`` I have some raisins , fine ones ; you know , seedless ones . 
We have a new sutler and he has such capital things . 
I bought ten pounds . 
I am used to something sweet . 
Would you like some ? 
... '' and Petya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins .
