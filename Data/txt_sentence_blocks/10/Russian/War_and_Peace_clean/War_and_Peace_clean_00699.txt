Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest , his tail extended , Bedouin , as if also conscious of the Emperor 's eye upon him , passed splendidly , lifting his feet with a high and graceful action , as if flying through the air without touching the ground . 
Rostov himself , his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse , rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face `` like a vewy devil , '' as Denisov expressed it . 
`` Fine fellows , the Pavlograds ! '' 
remarked the Emperor . 
`` My God , how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant ! '' 
thought Rostov . 
When the review was over , the newly arrived officers , and also Kutuzov 's , collected in groups and began to talk about the awards , about the Austrians and their uniforms , about their lines , about Bonaparte , and how badly the latter would fare now , especially if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side . 
But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander . 
His every word and movement was described with ecstasy . 
They all had but one wish : to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the Emperor 's command .
