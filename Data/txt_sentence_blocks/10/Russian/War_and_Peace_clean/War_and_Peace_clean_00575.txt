The beauty went to the aunt , but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre , looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions . 
`` Is n't she exquisite ? '' 
she said to Pierre , pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away . 
`` And how she carries herself ! 
For so young a girl , such tact , such masterly perfection of manner ! 
It comes from her heart . 
Happy the man who wins her ! 
With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society . 
Do n't you think so ? 
I only wanted to know your opinion , '' and Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go .
