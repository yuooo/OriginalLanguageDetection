`` It was the officer , your honor , stained it , '' answered the artilleryman , wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve , as if apologizing for the state of his gun . 
It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry , and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted . 
It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off , and the firing had begun to subside . 
Suddenly , near by on the right , shouting and firing were again heard . 
Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness . 
This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses . 
They all rushed out of the village again , but Tushin 's guns could not move , and the artillerymen , Tushin , and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate . 
The firing died down and soldiers , talking eagerly , streamed out of a side street . 
`` Not hurt , Petrov ? '' 
asked one .
