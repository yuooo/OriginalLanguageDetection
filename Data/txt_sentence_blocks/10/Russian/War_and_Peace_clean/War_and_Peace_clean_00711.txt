This short man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity , walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way . 
Prince Andrew did neither : a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor . 
`` Who was that ? '' 
asked Boris . 
`` He is one of the most remarkable , but to me most unpleasant of men - the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Prince Adam Czartoryski ... . 
It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations , '' added Bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress , as they passed out of the palace . 
Next day , the army began its campaign , and up to the very battle of Austerlitz , Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment . 
At dawn on the sixteenth of November , Denisov 's squadron , in which Nicholas Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration 's detachment , moved from the place where it had spent the night , advancing into action as arranged , and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad . 
Rostov saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants . 
All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously , all the inner struggle to conquer that fear , all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle , had been wasted .
