`` Here , take the child ! '' 
said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman , handing the little girl to her . 
`` Give her back to them , give her back ! '' 
he almost shouted , putting the child , who began screaming , on the ground , and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family . 
The old man was already sitting barefoot . 
The little Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other . 
The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs , but Pierre caught but a glimpse of this , his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile , swaying slowly from side to side , had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck . 
The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude , with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her . 
While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the Frenchman , the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing , and the young woman , clutching at her neck , screamed piercingly . 
`` Let that woman alone ! ''
