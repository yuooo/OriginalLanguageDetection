His Majesty the Emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me ... '' `` You see , my dear sir , I have read your project , '' interrupted Arakcheev , uttering only the first words amiably and then -- again without looking at Prince Andrew -- relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt . 
`` You are proposing new military laws ? 
There are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones . 
Nowadays everybody designs laws , it is easier writing than doing . '' 
`` I came at His Majesty the Emperor 's wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented , '' said Prince Andrew politely . 
`` I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee . 
I do not approve of it , '' said Arakcheev , rising and taking a paper from his writing table . 
`` Here ! '' 
and he handed it to Prince Andrew . 
Across the paper was scrawled in pencil , without capital letters , misspelled , and without punctuation : `` Unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles of War needlessly deviating . ''
