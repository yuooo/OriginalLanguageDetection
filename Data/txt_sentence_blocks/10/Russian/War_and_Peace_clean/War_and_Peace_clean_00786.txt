But he did not look at them : he looked only at what was going on in front of him -- at the battery . 
He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry , pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other . 
He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men , who evidently did not realize what they were doing . 
`` What are they about ? '' 
thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them . 
`` Why does n't the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed ? 
Why does n't the Frenchman stab him ? 
He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him ... '' And really another French soldier , trailing his musket , ran up to the struggling men , and the fate of the red-haired gunner , who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him , was about to be decided . 
But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended . 
It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon .
