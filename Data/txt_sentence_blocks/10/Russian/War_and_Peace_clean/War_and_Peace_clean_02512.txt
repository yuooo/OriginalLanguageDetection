But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea , and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower . 
He had regained consciousness that morning . 
The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche , but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea . 
The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness . 
When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes . 
Then he opened them and whispered softly : `` And the tea ? '' 
His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor . 
He felt Prince Andrew 's pulse , and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved . 
He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now , he would do so a little later with greater suffering . 
Timokhin , the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew 's regiment , had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him , having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino .
