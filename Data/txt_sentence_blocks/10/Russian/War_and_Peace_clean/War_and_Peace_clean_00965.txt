Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing room . 
The old countess , waiting for the return of her husband and son , sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house . 
Denisov , with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair , sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers , his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang , with his small , husky , but true voice , some verses called `` Enchantress , '' which he had composed , and to which he was trying to fit music : Enchantress , say , to my forsaken lyre What magic power is this recalls me still ? 
What spark has set my inmost soul on fire , What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill ? 
He was singing in passionate tones , gazing with his sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natasha . 
`` Splendid ! 
Excellent ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` Another verse , '' she said , without noticing Nicholas . 
`` Everything 's still the same with them , '' thought Nicholas , glancing into the drawing room , where he saw Vera and his mother with the old lady .
