Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in French , every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying , `` Is it not so , your excellency ? '' 
But Pfuel , like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side , shouted angrily at his own supporter , Wolzogen : `` Well , of course , what more is there to explain ? '' 
Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French . 
Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German . 
Toll explained to Volkonski in Russian . 
Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence . 
Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel , angry , determined , and absurdly self-confident as he was . 
Of all those present , evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself , nursed no hatred against anyone , and only desired that the plan , formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil , should be carried out . 
He was ridiculous , and unpleasantly sarcastic , but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea . 
Besides this , the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805 : there was now a panic fear of Napoleon 's genius , which , though concealed , was noticeable in every rejoinder .
