It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time . 
`` If anyone finds this silence inconvenient , let him talk , but I do n't want to , '' he seemed to say . 
Besides this , in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity , awe , and even love -- a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority . 
It was was as if he said to them : `` I know you , I know you , but why should I bother about you ? 
You 'd be only too glad , of course . '' 
Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women - even probably he did not , for in general he thought very little -- but his looks and manner gave that impression . 
The princess felt this , and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him , she turned to his father . 
The conversation was general and animated , thanks to Princess Lise 's voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth . 
She met Prince Vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people , and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private , long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences , though no such reminiscences really exist -- just as none existed in this case . 
Prince Vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole , whom she hardly knew , into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred .
