`` Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich , '' he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches , shoes , and a swallow-tail coat , who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing . 
The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall , and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs . 
`` My dear , '' she said to her son , once more stimulating him by a touch , `` you promised me ! '' 
The son , lowering his eyes , followed her quietly . 
They entered the large hall , from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili . 
Just as the mother and son , having reached the middle of the hall , were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered , the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasili came out -- wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast , as was his custom when at home -- taking leave of a good-looking , dark-haired man . 
This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor , Lorrain . 
`` Then it is certain ? '' 
said the prince . 
`` Prince , humanum est errare , * but ... '' replied the doctor , swallowing his r 's , and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent .
