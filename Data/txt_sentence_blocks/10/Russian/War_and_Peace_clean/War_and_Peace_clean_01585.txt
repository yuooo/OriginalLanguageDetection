Anatole left the box , serene and gay . 
Natasha went back to her father in the other box , now quite submissive to the world she found herself in . 
All that was going on before her now seemed quite natural , but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed , of Princess Mary , or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past . 
In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about , till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below . 
That was the only part of the fourth act that Natasha saw . 
She felt agitated and tormented , and the cause of this was Kuragin whom she could not help watching . 
As they were leaving the theater Anatole came up to them , called their carriage , and helped them in . 
As he was putting Natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow . 
Agitated and flushed she turned round . 
He was looking at her with glittering eyes , smiling tenderly .
