`` Why am I not free ? 
Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya ? '' 
And he involuntarily compared the two : the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other -- a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly . 
He tried to picture what would happen were he free . 
How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife . 
But no , he could not imagine that . 
He felt awed , and no clear picture presented itself to his mind . 
He had long ago pictured to himself a future with Sonya , and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sonya , but it was impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary , because he did not understand her but simply loved her . 
Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them , but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening . 
`` How she prayed ! ''
