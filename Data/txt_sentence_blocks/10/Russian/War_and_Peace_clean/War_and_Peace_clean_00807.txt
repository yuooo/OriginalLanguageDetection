Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost . 
No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutuzov was . 
Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct , others that it was not , and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor 's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy , who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor 's suite . 
One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left , and thither Rostov rode , not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience . 
When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops , he saw , near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it , two men on horseback facing the ditch . 
One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostov ; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse -LRB- which Rostov fancied he had seen before -RRB- rode up to the ditch , struck his horse with his spurs , and giving it the rein leaped lightly over . 
Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse 's hind hoofs . 
Turning the horse sharply , he again jumped the ditch , and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes , evidently suggesting that he should do the same . 
The rider , whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention , made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch . 
`` But it ca n't be he , alone in the midst of this empty field ! ''
