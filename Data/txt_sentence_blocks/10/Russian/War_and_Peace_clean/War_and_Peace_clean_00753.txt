`` Well , some more ! 
Some more ! '' 
a merry voice was saying in his soul . 
But no more shots came . 
Only when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop again , and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general . 
Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us . 
`` What does that prove ? '' 
he was saying as Rostov rode up . 
`` They might retreat and leave the pickets . '' 
`` It 's plain that they have not all gone yet , Prince , '' said Bagration .
