They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility ; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement . 
Bagration , knowing Bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant , received him with distinction and special marks of favor , explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next , and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat , `` which is also very important . '' 
`` However , there will hardly be an engagement today , '' said Bagration as if to reassure Prince Andrew . 
`` If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard , but if he wishes to stay with me , let him ... he 'll be of use here if he 's a brave officer , '' thought Bagration . 
Prince Andrew , without replying , asked the prince 's permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces , so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order . 
The officer on duty , a handsome , elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger , who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly , offered to conduct Prince Andrew .

`` There now , Prince ! 
We ca n't stop those fellows , '' said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers . 
`` The officers do n't keep them in hand .
