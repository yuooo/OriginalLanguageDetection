It 's time you two were parted , '' she added , looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father . 
Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand . 
Countess Mary remained in the sitting room . 
`` I should never , never have believed that one could be so happy , '' she whispered to herself . 
A smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed , and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt , through her happiness , that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant . 
Natasha had married in the early spring of 1813 , and in 1820 already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing . 
She had grown stouter and broader , so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust , motherly woman the slim , lively Natasha of former days . 
Her features were more defined and had a calm , soft , and serene expression . 
In her face there was none of the ever-glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm . 
Now her face and body were of all that one saw , and her soul was not visible at all .
