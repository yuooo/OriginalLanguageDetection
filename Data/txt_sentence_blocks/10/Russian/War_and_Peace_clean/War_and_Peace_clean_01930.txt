From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat , followed by the enemy . 
On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills . 
Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks . 
Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun , but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist . 
Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth . 
The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain . 
The marshes dried up . 
The cattle lowed from hunger , finding no food on the sun-parched meadows . 
Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness . 
But on the road , the highroad along which the troops marched , there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest ; the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep .
