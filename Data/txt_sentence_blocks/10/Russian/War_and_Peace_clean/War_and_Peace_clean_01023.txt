He went over his vices in his mind , not knowing to which of them to give the pre-eminence . 
`` Women , '' he said in a low , scarcely audible voice . 
The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer . 
At last he moved up to Pierre and , taking the kerchief that lay on the table , again bound his eyes . 
`` For the last time I say to you -- turn all your attention upon yourself , put a bridle on your senses , and seek blessedness , not in passion but in your own heart . 
The source of blessedness is not without us but within ... '' Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion . 
Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre , not the Rhetor but Pierre 's sponsor , Willarski , whom he recognized by his voice . 
To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre replied : `` Yes , yes , I agree , '' and with a beaming , childlike smile , his fat chest uncovered , stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted foot , he advanced , while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest . 
He was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the Lodge . 
Willarski coughed , he was answered by the Masonic knock with mallets , the doors opened before them .
