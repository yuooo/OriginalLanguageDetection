`` What about your son , your sister , and your father ? '' 
`` But that 's just the same as myself -- they are not others , '' explained Prince Andrew . 
`` The others , one 's neighbors , le prochain , as you and Princess Mary call it , are the chief source of all error and evil .

And he looked at Pierre with a mocking , challenging expression . 
He evidently wished to draw him on . 
`` You are joking , '' replied Pierre , growing more and more excited . 
`` What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good , and even doing a little -- though I did very little and did it very badly ? 
What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people , our serfs , people like ourselves , were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life , retribution , recompense , and consolation ? 
What evil and error are there in it , if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered , and I supplied them with a doctor , a hospital , and an asylum for the aged ?
