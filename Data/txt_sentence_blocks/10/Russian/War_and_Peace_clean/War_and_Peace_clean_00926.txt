`` Ah , what have you done to me ? '' 
it still seemed to say , and Prince Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget . 
He could not weep . 
The old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast , and to him , too , her face seemed to say : `` Ah , what have you done to me , and why ? '' 
And at the sight the old man turned angrily away . 
Another five days passed , and then the young Prince Nicholas Andreevich was baptized . 
The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy 's little red and wrinkled soles and palms . 
His grandfather , who was his godfather , trembling and afraid of dropping him , carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over to the godmother , Princess Mary . 
Prince Andrew sat in another room , faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font , and awaited the termination of the ceremony . 
He looked up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that the wax with the baby 's hair had not sunk in the font but had floated .
