Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room . 
But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting , a look of anxiety and fear , as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place , came over her face when she saw Pierre enter . 
Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room , her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy , but observant and natural , expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room . 
`` It is very good of you , Monsieur Pierre , to come and visit a poor invalid , '' said Anna Pavlovna , exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her . 
Pierre murmured something unintelligible , and continued to look round as if in search of something . 
On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile , as to an intimate acquaintance . 
Anna Pavlovna 's alarm was justified , for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty 's health . 
Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words : `` Do you know the Abbe Morio ? 
He is a most interesting man . '' 
`` Yes , I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace , and it is very interesting but hardly feasible . ''
