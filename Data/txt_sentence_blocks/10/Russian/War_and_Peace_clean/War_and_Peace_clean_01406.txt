Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on . 
Nicholas dismounted , and with Natasha and Petya , who had ridden up , stopped near the hounds , waiting to see how the matter would end . 
Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master , with the fox tied to his crupper . 
While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully , but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry . 
One of his eyes was black , but he probably was not even aware of it . 
`` What has happened ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` A likely thing , killing a fox our dogs had hunted ! 
And it was my gray bitch that caught it ! 
Go to law , indeed !
