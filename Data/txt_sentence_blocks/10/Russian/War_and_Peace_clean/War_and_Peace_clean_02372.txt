`` Oh , yes , in a minute ; wait ... or no ! 
No , of course ... go and say I will come directly , '' Pierre replied to the major-domo . 
But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door . 
There was no one in the passage . 
He went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and , frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands , went down as far as the first landing . 
The hall porter was standing at the front door . 
From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance . 
He went down that staircase and out into the yard . 
No one had seen him . 
But there were some carriages waiting , and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him .
