From Prince Shcherbatov 's house the prisoners were led straight down the Virgin 's Field , to the left of the nunnery , as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up . 
Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground , and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle . 
The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of Napoleon 's soldiers who were not on duty -- Germans , Italians , and Frenchmen , in a variety of uniforms . 
To the right and left of the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos . 
The prisoners were placed in a certain order , according to the list -LRB- Pierre was sixth -RRB- , and were led to the post . 
Several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them , and at that sound Pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away . 
He lost the power of thinking or understanding . 
He could only hear and see . 
And he had only one wish -- that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly . 
Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them .
