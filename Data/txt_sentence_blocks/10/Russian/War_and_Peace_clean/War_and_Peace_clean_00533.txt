He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge , but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds . 
One single sentiment , that of fear for his young and happy life , possessed his whole being . 
Rapidly leaping the furrows , he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay , now and then turning his good-natured , pale , young face to look back . 
A shudder of terror went through him : `` No , better not look , '' he thought , but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more . 
The French had fallen behind , and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and , turning , shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back . 
Rostov paused . 
`` No , there 's some mistake , '' thought he . 
`` They ca n't have wanted to kill me . '' 
But at the same time , his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it . 
He could run no more .
