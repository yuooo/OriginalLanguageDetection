Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money , so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles , but the necessity of going back on his word . 
With a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov 's hands and thought , `` Now then , make haste and let me have this card and I 'll take my cap and drive home to supper with Denisov , Natasha , and Sonya , and will certainly never touch a card again . '' 
At that moment his home life , jokes with Petya , talks with Sonya , duets with Natasha , piquet with his father , and even his comfortable bed in the house on the Povarskaya rose before him with such vividness , clearness , and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss , long past . 
He could not conceive that a stupid chance , letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left , might deprive him of all this happiness , newly appreciated and newly illumined , and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery . 
That could not be , yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov 's hands . 
Those broad , reddish hands , with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs , laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him . 
`` So you are not afraid to play with me ? '' 
repeated Dolokhov , and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards , leaned back in his chair , and began deliberately with a smile : `` Yes , gentlemen , I 've been told there 's a rumor going about Moscow that I 'm a sharper , so I advise you to be careful . '' 
`` Come now , deal ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov .
