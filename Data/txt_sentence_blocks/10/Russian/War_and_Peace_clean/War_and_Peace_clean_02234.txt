Prince Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent . 
The pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh , stomach , and back distracted him . 
All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked , bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent , as a few weeks previously , on that hot August day , such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the Smolensk road . 
Yes , it was the same flesh , the same chair a canon , the sight of which had even then filled him with horror , as by a presentiment . 
There were three operating tables in the tent . 
Two were occupied , and on the third they placed Prince Andrew . 
For a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables . 
On the nearest one sat a Tartar , probably a Cossack , judging by the uniform thrown down beside him . 
Four soldiers were holding him , and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back . 
`` Ooh , ooh , ooh ! ''
