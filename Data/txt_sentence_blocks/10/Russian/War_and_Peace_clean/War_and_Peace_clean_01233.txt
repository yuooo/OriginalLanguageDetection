Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies . 
I recollected myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with anger , but I did not sufficiently repent . 
Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy came and began relating various adventures . 
His coming vexed me from the first , and I said something disagreeable to him . 
He replied . 
I flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him . 
He became silent , and I recollected myself only when it was too late . 
My God , I can not get on with him at all . 
The cause of this is my egotism . 
I set myself above him and so become much worse than he , for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him .
