At eight o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry . 
Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers , but cabs were still driving about , tradesmen stood at their shops , and service was being held in the churches as usual . 
Alpatych went to the shops , to government offices , to the post office , and to the Governor 's . 
In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town , everybody was asking what should be done , and all were trying to calm one another . 
In front of the Governor 's house Alpatych found a large number of people , Cossacks , and a traveling carriage of the Governor 's . 
At the porch he met two of the landed gentry , one of whom he knew . 
This man , an ex-captain of police , was saying angrily : `` It 's no joke , you know ! 
It 's all very well if you 're single . 
` One man though undone is but one , ' as the proverb says , but with thirteen in your family and all the property ... They 've brought us to utter ruin ! 
What sort of governors are they to do that ?
