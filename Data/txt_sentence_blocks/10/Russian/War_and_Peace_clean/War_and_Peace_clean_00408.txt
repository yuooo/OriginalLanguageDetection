said the colonel in a bored voice , puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly . 
`` And why are you stopping here ? 
Do n't you see the skirmishers are retreating ? 
Lead the squadron back . '' 
The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man . 
The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river . 
The two Pavlograd squadrons , having crossed the bridge , retired up the hill one after the other . 
Their colonel , Karl Bogdanich Schubert , came up to Denisov 's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostov , without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin . 
Rostov , feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame , did not lift his eyes from the colonel 's athletic back , his nape covered with light hair , and his red neck . 
It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him , and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet 's courage , so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily ; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage .
