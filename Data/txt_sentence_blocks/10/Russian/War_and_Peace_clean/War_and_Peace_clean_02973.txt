The more the plundering by the French continued , the more both the wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed . 
But plundering by the Russians , with which the reoccupation of the city began , had an opposite effect : the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored . 
Besides the plunderers , very various people , some drawn by curiosity , some by official duties , some by self-interest -- house owners , clergy , officials of all kinds , tradesmen , artisans , and peasants -- streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart . 
Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town . 
Other peasants , having heard of their comrades ' discomfiture , came to town bringing rye , oats , and hay , and beat down one another 's prices to below what they had been in former days . 
Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day , and on all sides logs were being hewn , new houses built , and old , charred ones repaired . 
Tradesmen began trading in booths . 
Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses . 
The clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned . 
Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen .
