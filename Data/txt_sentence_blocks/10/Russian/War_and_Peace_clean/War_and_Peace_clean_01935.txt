Without waiting to hear him out , Prince Andrew asked : `` When did my father and sister leave ? '' 
meaning when did they leave for Moscow . 
Alpatych , understanding the question to refer to their departure for Bogucharovo , replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management , asking for instructions . 
`` Am I to let the troops have the oats , and to take a receipt for them ? 
We have still six hundred quarters left , '' he inquired . 
`` What am I to say to him ? '' 
thought Prince Andrew , looking down on the old man 's bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief . 
`` Yes , let them have it , '' replied Prince Andrew . 
`` If you noticed some disorder in the garden , '' said Alpatych , `` it was impossible to prevent it . 
Three regiments have been here and spent the night , dragoons mostly .
