She looked at him and , screwing up her eyes sternly , continued to upbraid the general who had won from her . 
`` Very pleased , mon cher , '' she then said , holding out her hand to Nicholas . 
`` Pray come and see me . '' 
After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father , whom Malvintseva had evidently not liked , and having asked what Nicholas knew of Prince Andrew , who also was evidently no favorite of hers , the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her . 
Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed . 
At the mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear , which he himself did not understand . 
When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing , but the governor 's little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and , saying that she wanted to have a talk with him , led him to her sitting room , from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way . 
`` Do you know , dear boy , '' began the governor 's wife with a serious expression on her kind little face , `` that really would be the match for you : would you like me to arrange it ? '' 
`` Whom do you mean , Aunt ? '' 
asked Nicholas .
