said Alpatych , puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did , and he climbed into the trap . 
After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done , Alpatych , not trying to imitate the prince now , lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times . 
`` If there is anything ... come back , Yakov Alpatych ! 
For Christ 's sake think of us ! '' 
cried his wife , referring to the rumors of war and the enemy . 
`` Women , women ! 
Women 's fuss ! '' 
muttered Alpatych to himself and started on his journey , looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still-green , thickly growing oats , and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time . 
As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year 's splendid crop of corn , scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped , made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest , and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince 's orders . 
Having baited the horses twice on the way , he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of August .
