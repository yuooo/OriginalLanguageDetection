`` Do I remember Nicholas ? '' 
`` No , Sonya , but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly , remember everything ? '' 
said Natasha , with an expressive gesture , evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning . 
`` I remember Nikolenka too , I remember him well , '' she said . 
`` But I do n't remember Boris . 
I do n't remember him a bit . '' 
`` What ! 
You do n't remember Boris ? '' 
asked Sonya in surprise . 
`` It 's not that I do n't remember -- I know what he is like , but not as I remember Nikolenka .
