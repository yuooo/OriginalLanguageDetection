Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and Sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall , not having been invited to dance . 
She stood with her slender arms hanging down , her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly , and with bated breath and glittering , frightened eyes gazed straight before her , evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery . 
She was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom Peronskaya was pointing out -- she had but one thought : `` Is it possible no one will ask me , that I shall not be among the first to dance ? 
Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me ? 
They do not even seem to see me , or if they do they look as if they were saying , ` Ah , she 's not the one I 'm after , so it 's not worth looking at her ! ' 
No , it 's impossible , '' she thought . 
`` They must know how I long to dance , how splendidly I dance , and how they would enjoy dancing with me . '' 
The strains of the polonaise , which had continued for a considerable time , had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha 's ears . 
She wanted to cry . 
Peronskaya had left them .
