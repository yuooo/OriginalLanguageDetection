Princess Helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt 's husband on the box lid . 
`` That is probably the work of Vinesse , '' said Pierre , mentioning a celebrated miniaturist , and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table . 
He half rose , meaning to go round , but the aunt handed him the snuffbox , passing it across Helene 's back . 
Helene stooped forward to make room , and looked round with a smile . 
She was , as always at evening parties , wearing a dress such as was then fashionable , cut very low at front and back . 
Her bust , which had always seemed like marble to Pierre , was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders , so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them . 
He was conscious of the warmth of her body , the scent of perfume , and the creaking of her corset as she moved . 
He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress , but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments . 
And having once seen this he could not help being aware it , just as we can not renew an illusion we have once seen through . 
`` So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am ? ''
