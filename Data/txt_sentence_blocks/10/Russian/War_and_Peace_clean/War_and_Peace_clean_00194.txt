Faster , faster , and faster ; lightly , more lightly , and yet more lightly whirled the count , flying round Marya Dmitrievna , now on his toes , now on his heels ; until , turning his partner round to her seat , he executed the final pas , raising his soft foot backwards , bowing his perspiring head , smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm , amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natasha . 
Both partners stood still , breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs . 
`` That 's how we used to dance in our time , ma chere , '' said the count . 
`` That was a Daniel Cooper ! '' 
exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna , tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily . 
While in the Rostovs ' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced , to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered , and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper , Count Bezukhov had a sixth stroke . 
The doctors pronounced recovery impossible . 
After a mute confession , communion was administered to the dying man , preparations made for the sacrament of unction , and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments . 
Outside the house , beyond the gates , a group of undertakers , who hid whenever a carriage drove up , waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral . 
The Military Governor of Moscow , who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count 's health , came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine 's court , Count Bezukhov .
