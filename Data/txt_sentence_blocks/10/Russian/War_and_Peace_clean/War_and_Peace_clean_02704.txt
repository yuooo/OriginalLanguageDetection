But it was impossible to make the Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners . 
None of them listened to orders . 
Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot , besides standards and -LRB- what seemed most important to the Cossacks -RRB- horses , saddles , horsecloths , and the like . 
All this had to be dealt with , the prisoners and guns secured , the booty divided -- not without some shouting and even a little themselves -- and it was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves . 
The French , not being farther pursued , began to recover themselves : they formed into detachments and began firing . 
Orlov-Denisov , still waiting for the other columns to arrive , advanced no further . 
Meantime , according to the dispositions which said that `` the First Column will march '' and so on , the infantry of the belated columns , commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll , had started in due order and , as always happens , had got somewhere , but not to their appointed places . 
As always happens the men , starting cheerfully , began to halt ; murmurs were heard , there was a sense of confusion , and finally a backward movement . 
Adjutants and generals galloped about , shouted , grew angry , quarreled , said they had come quite wrong and were late , gave vent to a little abuse , and at last gave it all up and went forward , simply to get somewhere . 
`` We shall get somewhere or other ! ''
