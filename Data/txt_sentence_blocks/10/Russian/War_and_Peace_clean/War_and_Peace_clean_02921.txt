Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then , submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position , raised his head and began to speak . 
A throng of officers surrounded him . 
He looked attentively around at the circle of officers , recognizing several of them . 
`` I thank you all ! '' 
he said , addressing the soldiers and then again the officers . 
In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard . 
`` I thank you all for your hard and faithful service . 
The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you ! 
Honor to you forever . '' 
He paused and looked around .
