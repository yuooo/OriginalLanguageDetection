`` She went . 
Suddenly there was a great wind . 
The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down ... '' Here he could contain himself no longer and went on , between gasps of laughter : `` And the whole world knew ... '' And so the anecdote ended . 
Though it was unintelligible why he had told it , or why it had to be told in Russian , still Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte 's social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre 's unpleasant and unamiable outburst . 
After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls , about theatricals , and who would meet whom , and when and where . 
Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree , the guests began to take their leave . 
Pierre was ungainly . 
Stout , about the average height , broad , with huge red hands ; he did not know , as the saying is , how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one ; that is , how to say something particularly agreeable before going away . 
Besides this he was absent-minded . 
When he rose to go , he took up instead of his own , the general 's three-cornered hat , and held it , pulling at the plume , till the general asked him to restore it .
