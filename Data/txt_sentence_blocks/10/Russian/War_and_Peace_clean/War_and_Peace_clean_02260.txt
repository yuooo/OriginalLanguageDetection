Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to retreat , or was it the evening before , when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders ? 
Or was it earlier still ? 
... When , when was this terrible affair decided ? 
Moscow must be abandoned . 
The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given . '' 
To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army . 
And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed -LRB- the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski , under whom he had served in Turkey , galled him -RRB- , but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why , against the Emperor 's wish and by the will of the people , he had been chosen commander in chief . 
He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances , and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear , and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue . 
But something had to be decided , and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped . 
He called the most important generals to him .
