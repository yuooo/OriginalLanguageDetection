His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause his grief . 
He might ... not only might but should , have gone up to the sovereign . 
It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it ... `` What have I done ? '' 
thought he . 
And he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor , but there was no one beyond the ditch now . 
Only some carts and carriages were passing by . 
From one of the drivers he learned that Kutuzov 's staff were not far off , in the village the vehicles were going to . 
Rostov followed them . 
In front of him walked Kutuzov 's groom leading horses in horsecloths . 
Then came a cart , and behind that walked an old , bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat .
