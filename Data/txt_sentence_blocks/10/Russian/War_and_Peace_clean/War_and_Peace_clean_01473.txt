With screams squeals , and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop -- the other sleighs followed . 
The shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head , with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required . 
Nicholas overtook the first sleigh . 
They were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow , near a river . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
thought he . 
`` It 's the Kosoy meadow , I suppose . 
But no -- this is something new I 've never seen before . 
This is n't the Kosoy meadow nor the Demkin hill , and heaven only knows what it is ! 
It is something new and enchanted .
