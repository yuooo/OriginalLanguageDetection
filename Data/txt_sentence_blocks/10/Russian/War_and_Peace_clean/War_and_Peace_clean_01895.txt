In the evening Michael Ivanovich , sent by the prince , came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew 's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room . 
She gave it to him and , unpleasant as it was to her to do so , ventured to ask him what her father was doing . 
`` Always busy , '' replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale . 
`` He 's worrying very much about the new building . 
He has been reading a little , but now '' -- Michael Ivanovich went on , lowering his voice -- `` now he 's at his desk , busy with his will , I expect . '' 
-LRB- One of the prince 's favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his `` will . '' -RRB- 
`` And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk ? '' 
asked Princess Mary . 
`` Oh , yes , he has been waiting to start for some time . '' 
When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter , the old prince , with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes , was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles , holding a paper in his outstretched hand , and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript -- his `` Remarks '' as he termed it -- which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death .
