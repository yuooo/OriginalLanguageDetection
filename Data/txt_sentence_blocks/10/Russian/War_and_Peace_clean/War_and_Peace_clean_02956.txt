Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor honored by his presence . 
Kutuzov had received the Order of St. George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors , but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him . 
The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example , but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good-for-nothing . 
When Kutuzov , conforming to a custom of Catherine 's day , ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the Emperor 's feet on his entering the ballroom , the Emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words , `` the old comedian . '' 
The Emperor 's displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased at Vilna by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign . 
When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled about him : `` You have not only saved Russia , you have saved Europe ! '' 
they all understood that the war was not ended . 
Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia , but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained . 
He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops , spoke of the hardships already endured by the people , of the possibility of failure and so forth . 
This being the field marshal 's frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war .
