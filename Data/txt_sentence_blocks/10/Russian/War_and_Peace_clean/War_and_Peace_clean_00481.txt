He seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying , and sat plunged in thought . 
Five minutes later , gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage , he turned to Prince Andrew . 
There was not a trace of agitation on his face . 
With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor , about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair , and about some ladies they both knew . 
On November 1 Kutuzov had received , through a spy , news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position . 
The spy reported that the French , after crossing the bridge at Vienna , were advancing in immense force upon Kutuzov 's line of communication with the troops that were arriving from Russia . 
If Kutuzov decided to remain at Krems , Napoleon 's army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand , and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm . 
If Kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia , he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains , defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhowden . 
If Kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems to Olmutz , to unite with the troops arriving from Russia , he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge , and encumbered by his baggage and transport , having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong , who would hem him in from two sides . 
Kutuzov chose this latter course .
