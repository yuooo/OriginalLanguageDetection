To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment . 
But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the question . 
Time has gone by which I could not detain , the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting , nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me . 
The moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable , and at that moment I could make only one movement , and whatever movement I made would be the only one . 
That I did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then . 
And since I could make only one movement at that single moment of time , it could not have been any other . 
To imagine it as free , it is necessary to imagine it in the present , on the boundary between the past and the future -- that is , outside time , which is impossible . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased , we never reach a conception of complete freedom , that is , an absence of cause . 
However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action , our own or another 's , the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause , for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable . 
I raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause , but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action .
