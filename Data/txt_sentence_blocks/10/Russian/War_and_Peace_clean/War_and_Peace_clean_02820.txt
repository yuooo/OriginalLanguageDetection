he repeated in a gentle whisper . 
`` Oh , what can I do for him ? '' 
he thought , and opening the door he let the boy pass in first . 
When the boy had entered the hut , Petya sat down at a distance from him , considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him . 
But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy . 
The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya 's attention from the drummer boy , to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given , and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners . 
Petya had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov 's extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the French , so from the moment he entered the hut Petya did not take his eyes from him , but braced himself up more and more and held his head high , that he might not be unworthy even of such company . 
Dolokhov 's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity . 
Denisov wore a Cossack coat , had a beard , had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder-Worker on his breast , and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position . 
But Dolokhov , who in Moscow had worn a Persian costume , had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the Guards .
