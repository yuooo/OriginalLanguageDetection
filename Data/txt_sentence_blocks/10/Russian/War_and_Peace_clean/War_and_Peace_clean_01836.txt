His love for Natasha , Antichrist , Napoleon , the invasion , the comet , 666 , L'Empereur Napoleon , and L'russe Besuhof -- all this had to mature and culminate , to lift him out of that spellbound , petty sphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness . 
* Forty-two . 
On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read , Pierre had promised the Rostovs to bring them , from Count Rostopchin whom he knew well , both the appeal to the people and the news from the army . 
In the morning , when he went to call at Rostopchin 's he met there a courier fresh from the army , an acquaintance of his own , who often danced at Moscow balls . 
`` Do , please , for heaven 's sake , relieve me of something ! '' 
said the courier . 
`` I have a sackful of letters to parents . '' 
Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father . 
Pierre took that letter , and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor 's appeal to Moscow , which had just been printed , the last army orders , and his own most recent bulletin . 
Glancing through the army orders , Pierre found in one of them , in the lists of killed , wounded , and rewarded , the name of Nicholas Rostov , awarded a St. George 's Cross of the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostrovna affair , and in the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkonski , appointed to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs .
