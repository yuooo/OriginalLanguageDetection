Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that . 
He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him . 
`` Lieutenant , he has a dagger , '' were the first words Pierre understood . 
`` Ah , a weapon ? '' 
said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre . 
`` All right , you can tell all about it at the court-martial . '' 
Then he turned to Pierre . 
`` Do you speak French ? '' 
Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply . 
His face probably looked very terrible , for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre .
