But now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life . 
And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully ; she felt jealous of Natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort , had never needed to sacrifice herself , but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody . 
And for the first time Sonya felt that out of her pure , quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle , virtue , or religion . 
Under the influence of this feeling Sonya , whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive , having answered the countess in vague general terms , avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas , not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever . 
The bustle and terror of the Rostovs ' last days in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya . 
She was glad to find escape from them in practical activity . 
But when she heard of Prince Andrew 's presence in their house , despite her sincere pity for him and for Natasha , she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas . 
She knew that Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him . 
She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another , and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity . 
Despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey , this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered Sonya .
