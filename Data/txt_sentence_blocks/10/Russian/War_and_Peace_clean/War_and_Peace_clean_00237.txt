In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre : `` Yes , my dear , this is a great loss for us all , not to speak of you . 
But God will support you : you are young , and are now , I hope , in command of an immense fortune . 
The will has not yet been opened . 
I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head , but it imposes duties on you , and you must be a man . '' 
Pierre was silent . 
`` Perhaps later on I may tell you , my dear boy , that if I had not been there , God only knows what would have happened ! 
You know , Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris . 
But he had no time . 
I hope , my dear friend , you will carry out your father 's wish ? '' 
Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna .
