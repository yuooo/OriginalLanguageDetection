Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body . 
I lift my arm and let it fall . 
My action seems to me free ; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction , I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body . 
I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles . 
For my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles . 
To conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space , which is evidently impossible . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed , we never get a conception of freedom in time . 
For if I examine an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not being free , for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed . 
Can I lift my arm ? 
I lift it , but ask myself : could I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed ?
