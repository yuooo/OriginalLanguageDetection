Anticipation that the failure of the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led to dissatisfaction , contempt , and ridicule , more and more strongly expressed . 
The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form , making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame . 
They did not talk seriously to him ; when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality , but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn . 
Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man ; that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans , that he would answer with his phrases -LRB- which they thought were mere phrases -RRB- about a `` golden bridge , '' about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions , and so forth . 
They had heard all that before . 
And all he said -- that it was necessary to await provisions , or that the men had no boots -- was so simple , while what they proposed was so complicated and clever , that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they , though not in power , were commanders of genius . 
After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg hero Wittgenstein , this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum . 
Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders . 
Only once , after the affair of the Berezina , did he get angry and write to Bennigsen -LRB- who reported separately to the Emperor -RRB- the following letter : `` On account of your spells of ill health , will your excellency please be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this , and there await further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty . '' 
But after Bennigsen 's departure , the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich joined the army .
