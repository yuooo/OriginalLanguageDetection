Pfuel was evidently of that sort . 
He had a science -- the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great 's wars , and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous -- monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars , they did not accord with the theory , and therefore could not serve as material for science . 
In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible , for the plan of campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt , but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war . 
On the contrary , the deviations made from his theory were , in his opinion , the sole cause of the whole disaster , and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark , `` There , I said the whole affair would go to the devil ! '' 
Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theory 's object -- its practical application . 
His love of theory made him hate everything practical , and he would not listen to it . 
He was even pleased by failures , for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory . 
He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the present war , with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong , and who is not displeased that it should be so . 
The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently . 
He passed into the next room , and the deep , querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there .
