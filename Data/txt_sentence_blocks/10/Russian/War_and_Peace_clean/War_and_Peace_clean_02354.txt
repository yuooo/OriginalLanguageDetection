`` We will still take all the most necessary things . '' 
The count nodded affirmatively , and Natasha , at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag , ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard . 
The servants gathered round Natasha , but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself , in his wife 's name , confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms . 
When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal . 
It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done , just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do . 
The whole household , as if to atone for not having done it sooner , set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts . 
The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts .
