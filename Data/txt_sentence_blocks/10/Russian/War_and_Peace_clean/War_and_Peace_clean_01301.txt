`` Pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy , and now I do believe in it . 
Let the dead bury their dead , but while one has life one must live and be happy ! '' 
thought he . 
One morning Colonel Berg , whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in Moscow and Petersburg , came to see him . 
Berg arrived in an immaculate brand-new uniform , with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair . 
`` I have just been to see the countess , your wife . 
Unfortunately she could not grant my request , but I hope , Count , I shall be more fortunate with you , '' he said with a smile . 
`` What is it you wish , Colonel ? 
I am at your service . '' 
`` I have now quite settled in my new rooms , Count '' -LRB- Berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable -RRB- , `` and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife 's friends . ''
