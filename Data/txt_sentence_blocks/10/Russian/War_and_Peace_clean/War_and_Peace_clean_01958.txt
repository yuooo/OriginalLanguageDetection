The morning after little Nicholas had left , the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief . 
His caleche was already at the door . 
Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs . 
She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden . 
Suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces . 
Princess Mary ran out to the porch , down the flower-bordered path , and into the avenue . 
A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her , and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations . 
She ran up to him and , in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue , could not be sure what change there was in his face . 
All she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission . 
On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound .
