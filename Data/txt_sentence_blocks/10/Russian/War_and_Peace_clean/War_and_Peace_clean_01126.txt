muttered the officer , threateningly , and turning his horse he trotted away , jolting in his saddle . 
`` A dog astwide a fence ! 
A weal dog astwide a fence ! '' 
shouted Denisov after him -LRB- the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman -RRB- and riding up to Rostov , he burst out laughing . 
`` I 've taken twansports from the infantwy by force ! '' 
he said . 
`` After all , ca n't let our men starve . '' 
The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment , but learning from Lavrushka that the transport was unescorted , Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force . 
The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely , and they even shared them with the other squadrons . 
The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov , and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said : `` This is how I look at this affair : I know nothing about it and wo n't begin proceedings , but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received .
