Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the room and , returning to her hut , fell sobbing on her bed . 
From that time , during all the rest of the Rostovs ' journey , at every halting place and wherever they spent a night , Natasha never left the wounded Bolkonski , and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man . 
Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die in her daughter 's arms during the journey -- as , judging by what the doctor said , it seemed might easily happen -- she could not oppose Natasha . 
Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed , no one -- least of all Natasha and Prince Andrew -- spoke of this : the unsettled question of life and death , which hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia , shut out all other considerations . 
On the third of September Pierre awoke late . 
His head was aching , the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body , and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before . 
That something shameful was his yesterday 's conversation with Captain Ramballe . 
It was eleven by the clock , but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors . 
Pierre rose , rubbed his eyes , and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table , he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day . 
`` Am I not too late ? ''
