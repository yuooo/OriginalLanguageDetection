I imagine , '' he went on , warming to his subject , `` that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service , and chair a canon * we are ready to make of ourselves -- and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel . '' 
* `` Food for cannon . '' 
Many persons withdrew from the circle , noticing the senator 's sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre 's remarks . 
Only Count Rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer , the senator , and in general with whatever speech he had last heard . 
`` I think that before discussing these questions , '' Pierre continued , `` we should ask the Emperor -- most respectfully ask His Majesty -- to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are , and then ... '' But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides . 
The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance , a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him , Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin . 
Adraksin was in uniform , and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man . 
With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face , Adraksin shouted at Pierre : `` In the first place , I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor about that , and secondly , if the Russian nobility had that right , the Emperor could not answer such a question . 
The troops are moved according to the enemy 's movements and the number of men increases and decreases ... '' Another voice , that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age , whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies ' and knew as a bad cardplayer , and who , also transformed by his uniform , came up to Pierre , interrupted Adraksin . 
`` Yes , and this is not a time for discussing , '' he continued , `` but for acting : there is war in Russia !
