The Rostovs ' footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick . 
Pierre , from club habit , always left both hat and stick in the anteroom . 
The first person he saw in the house was Natasha . 
Even before he saw her , while taking off his cloak , he heard her . 
She was practicing solfa exercises in the music room . 
He knew that she had not sung since her illness , and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him . 
He opened the door softly and saw her , in the lilac dress she had worn at church , walking about the room singing . 
She had her back to him when he opened the door , but when , turning quickly , she saw his broad , surprised face , she blushed and came rapidly up to him . 
`` I want to try to sing again , '' she said , adding as if by way of excuse , `` it is , at least , something to do . '' 
`` That 's capital ! ''
