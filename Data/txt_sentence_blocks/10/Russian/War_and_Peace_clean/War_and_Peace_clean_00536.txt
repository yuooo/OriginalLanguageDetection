Everything seemed lost . 
But at that moment the French who were attacking , suddenly and without any apparent reason , ran back and disappeared from the outskirts , and Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse . 
It was Timokhin 's company , which alone had maintained its order in the wood and , having lain in ambush in a ditch , now attacked the French unexpectedly . 
Timokhin , armed only with a sword , had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad , drunken determination that , taken by surprise , the French had thrown down their muskets and run . 
Dolokhov , running beside Timokhin , killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar . 
Our fugitives returned , the battalions re-formed , and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed . 
Our reserve units were able to join up , and the fight was at an end . 
The regimental commander and Major Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge , letting the retreating companies pass by them , when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander 's stirrup , almost leaning against him . 
The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth , he had no knapsack or cap , his head was bandaged , and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung . 
He had an officer 's sword in his hand .
