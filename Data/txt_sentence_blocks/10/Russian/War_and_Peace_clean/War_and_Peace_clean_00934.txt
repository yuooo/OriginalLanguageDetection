In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before . 
Orders were given to raise recruits , ten men in every thousand for the regular army , and besides this , nine men in every thousand for the militia . 
Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of . 
For the Rostov family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow , and only awaited the termination of Denisov 's furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment . 
His approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself , but rather gave zest to his pleasures . 
He spent the greater part of his time away from home , at dinners , parties , and balls . 
On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home , a thing he had rarely done of late . 
It was a grand farewell dinner , as he and Denisov were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany . 
About twenty people were present , including Dolokhov and Denisov . 
Never had love been so much in the air , and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostovs ' house as at this holiday time .
