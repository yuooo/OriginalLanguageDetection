`` Perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died . 
While talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice . 
He wanted to see me , and I was standing close by , outside the door . 
It was sad and painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him . 
I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive -- he had forgotten she was dead -- and Tikhon reminded him that she was no more , and he shouted , ` Fool ! ' 
He was greatly depressed . 
From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed , ` My God ! ' 
Why did n't I go in then ? 
What could he have done to me ? 
What could I have lost ?
