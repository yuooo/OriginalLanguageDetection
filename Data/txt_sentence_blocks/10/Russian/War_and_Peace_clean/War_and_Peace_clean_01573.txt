Having looked at Natasha he approached his sister , laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box , nodded to her , and leaning forward asked a question , with a motion toward Natasha . 
`` Mais charmante ! '' 
said he , evidently referring to Natasha , who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips . 
Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside Dolokhov , nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly . 
He winked at him gaily , smiled , and rested his foot against the orchestra screen . 
`` How like the brother is to the sister , '' remarked the count . 
`` And how handsome they both are ! '' 
Shinshin , lowering his voice , began to tell the count of some intrigue of Kuragin 's in Moscow , and Natasha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was `` charmante . '' 
The first act was over . 
In the stalls everyone began moving about , going out and coming in .
