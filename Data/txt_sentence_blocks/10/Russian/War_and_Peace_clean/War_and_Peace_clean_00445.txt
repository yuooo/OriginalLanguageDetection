Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform , which he had not worn for a long time , he went into Bilibin 's study fresh , animated , and handsome , with his hand bandaged . 
In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps . 
With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin , who was a secretary to the embassy , Bolkonski was already acquainted . 
Bilibin introduced him to the others . 
The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin 's were young , wealthy , gay society men , who here , as in Vienna , formed a special set which Bilibin , their leader , called les notres . 
* This set , consisting almost exclusively of diplomats , evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society , to certain women , and to the official side of the service . 
These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves , an honor they did not extend to many . 
From politeness and to start conversation , they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle , and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip . 
* Ours . 
`` But the best of it was , '' said one , telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat , `` that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it .
