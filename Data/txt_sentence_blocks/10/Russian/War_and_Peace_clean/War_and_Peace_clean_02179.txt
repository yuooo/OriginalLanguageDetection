Pierre went to the right , and unexpectedly encountered one of Raevski 's adjutants whom he knew . 
The adjutant looked angrily at him , evidently also intending to shout at him , but on recognizing him he nodded . 
`` How have you got here ? '' 
he said , and galloped on . 
Pierre , feeling out of place there , having nothing to do , and afraid of getting in someone 's way again , galloped after the adjutant . 
`` What 's happening here ? 
May I come with you ? '' 
he asked . 
`` One moment , one moment ! '' 
replied the adjutant , and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow , he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre .
