A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg . 
Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound , but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital . 
In June the battle of Friedland was fought , in which the Pavlograds did not take part , and after that an armistice was proclaimed . 
Rostov , who felt his friend 's absence very much , having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs , took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denisov in hospital . 
The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated by Russian and French troops . 
Because it was summer , when it is so beautiful out in the fields , the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences , its foul streets , tattered inhabitants , and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about . 
The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces . 
Several bandaged soldiers , with pale swollen faces , were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard . 
Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air . 
On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar .
