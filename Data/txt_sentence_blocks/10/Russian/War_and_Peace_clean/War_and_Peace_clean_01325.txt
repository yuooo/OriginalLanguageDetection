`` Fourthly and finally , '' the father said , looking ironically at his son , `` I beg you to put it off for a year : go abroad , take a cure , look out as you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas . 
Then if your love or passion or obstinacy -- as you please -- is still as great , marry ! 
And that 's my last word on it .
