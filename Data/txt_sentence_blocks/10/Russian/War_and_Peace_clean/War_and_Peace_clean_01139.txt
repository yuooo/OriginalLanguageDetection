said the assistant . 
But , just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in , Rostov entered the soldiers ' ward . 
The foul air , to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor , was still stronger here . 
It was a little different , more pungent , and one felt that this was where it originated . 
In the long room , brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows , the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls , and leaving a passage in the middle . 
Most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers . 
Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces , and all looked intently at Rostov with the same expression of hope , of relief , reproach , and envy of another 's health . 
Rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there . 
He stood still , looking silently around . 
He had not at all expected such a sight .
