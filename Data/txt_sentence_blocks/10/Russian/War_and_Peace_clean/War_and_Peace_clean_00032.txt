I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn . 
That would be the best way . '' 
The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya , belonging to one of the best families in Russia , but she was poor , and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections . 
She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son . 
It was , in fact , solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna 's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte 's story . 
Prince Vasili 's words frightened her , an embittered look clouded her once handsome face , but only for a moment ; then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasili 's arm more tightly . 
`` Listen to me , Prince , '' said she . 
`` I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again , nor have I ever reminded you of my father 's friendship for you ; but now I entreat you for God 's sake to do this for my son -- and I shall always regard you as a benefactor , '' she added hurriedly . 
`` No , do n't be angry , but promise ! 
I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused .
