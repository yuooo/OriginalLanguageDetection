The first troops started at once , and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry . 
At daybreak , however , those nearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge , ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys , while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind , and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them . 
They all rushed forward to the bridge , onto it , and to the fords and the boats . 
Kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow . 
By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September , only the rear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb , where they had ample room . 
The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it . 
At that very time , at ten in the morning of the second of September , Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at the panorama spread out before him . 
From the twenty-sixth of August to the second of September , that is from the battle of Borodino to the entry of the French into Moscow , during the whole of that agitating , memorable week , there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise , when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring , when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart , when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air , when even the nights are warm , and when in those dark warm nights , golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky . 
At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still held . 
The brightness of the morning was magical .
