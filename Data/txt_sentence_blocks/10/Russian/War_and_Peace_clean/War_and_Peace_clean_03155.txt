These are the instinctive , plain , and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period . 
For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history , whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves . 
If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that God , to reward or punish his people , gave Napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends , and that reply , would have been clear and complete . 
One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon , but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period , nor would there have been any contradictions . 
But modern history can not give that reply . 
Science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs , and therefore history ought to give other answers . 
Modern history replying to these questions says : you want to know what this movement means , what caused it , and what force produced these events ? 
Then listen : `` Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man ; he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly . 
His descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly . 
And they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses .
