`` Count , be so good as to allow me ... for God 's sake , to get into some corner of one of your carts ! 
I have nothing here with me ... . 
I shall be all right on a loaded cart ... '' Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master . 
`` Oh , yes , yes , yes ! '' 
said the count hastily . 
`` I shall be very pleased , very pleased . 
Vasilich , you 'll see to it . 
Just unload one or two carts . 
Well , what of it ... do what 's necessary ... '' said the count , muttering some indefinite order . 
But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer 's face had already sealed the order .
