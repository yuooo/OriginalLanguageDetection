One of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek . 
His whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby 's head . 
His nose and mouth were twisted to one side . 
This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself . 
Another , a young lad , a fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face , looked at Pierre kindly , with a fixed smile . 
The third lay prone so that his face was not visible . 
The cavalry singers were passing close by : Ah lost , quite lost ... is my head so keen , Living in a foreign land . 
they sang their soldiers ' dance song . 
As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment , the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment . 
But beneath the slope , by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where Pierre stood , it was damp , somber , and sad .
