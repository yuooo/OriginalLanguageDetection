`` Thank you , my dear , you have cheered me up , '' said she as she always did . 
`` But best of all you have brought yourself back -- for I never saw anything like it , you ought to give your wife a scolding ! 
What are we to do with her ? 
She is like a mad woman when you are away . 
Does n't see anything , does n't remember anything , '' she went on , repeating her usual phrases . 
`` Look , Anna Timofeevna , '' she added to her companion , `` see what a box for cards my son has brought us ! '' 
Belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material . 
Though Pierre , Natasha , Nicholas , Countess Mary , and Denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess -- not that anything was hidden from her , but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times : that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married , which she would again be unable to remember -- yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit , and Pierre answered the countess ' questions as to whether Prince Vasili had aged and whether Countess Mary Alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them , and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent . 
Conversation of this kind , interesting to no one yet unavoidable , continued all through teatime . 
All the grown-up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which Sonya presided beside the samovar .
