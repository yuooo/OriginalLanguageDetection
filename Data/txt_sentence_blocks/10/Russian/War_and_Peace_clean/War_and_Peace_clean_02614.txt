Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word . 
To him Davout was not merely a French general , but a man notorious for his cruelty . 
Looking at his cold face , as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer , Pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life ; but he did not know what to say . 
He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination , yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing . 
So he was silent . 
But before he had decided what to do , Davout raised his head , pushed his spectacles back on his forehead , screwed up his eyes , and looked intently at him . 
`` I know that man , '' he said in a cold , measured tone , evidently calculated to frighten Pierre . 
The chill that had been running down Pierre 's back now seized his head as in a vise . 
`` You can not know me , General , I have never seen you ... '' `` He is a Russian spy , '' Davout interrupted , addressing another general who was present , but whom Pierre had not noticed . 
Davout turned away .
