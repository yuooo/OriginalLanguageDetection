And the exile , separated from the beloved France so dear to his heart , died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity . 
But in Europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects . '' 
It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic -- a caricature of the historical accounts . 
On the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies , not meeting the questions , which all the historians give , from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period . 
The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history , like a deaf man , answers questions no one has asked . 
If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples , the first question -- in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible -- is : what is the power that moves peoples ? 
To this , modern history laboriously replies either that Napoleon was a great genius , or that Louis XIV was very proud , or that certain writers wrote certain books . 
All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it , but it is not what was asked . 
All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through Napoleons , Louis-es , and writers ; but we do not acknowledge such a power , and therefore before speaking about Napoleons , Louis-es , and authors , we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations . 
If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared , it should be explained in what this new force consists , for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force .
