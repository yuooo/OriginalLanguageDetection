If not , as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment , there will be a row and the affair may end badly . '' 
From the regimental commander 's , Denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice . 
In the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in . 
Denisov could not speak and gasped for breath . 
When Rostov asked what was the matter , he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse , feeble voice . 
Alarmed at Denisov 's condition , Rostov suggested that he should undress , drink some water , and send for the doctor . 
`` Twy me for wobbewy ... oh ! 
Some more water ... Let them twy me , but I 'll always thwash scoundwels ... and I 'll tell the Empewo ' ... Ice ... '' he muttered . 
The regimental doctor , when he came , said it was absolutely necessary to bleed Denisov . 
A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him .
