Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment ? 
Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel ? 
Is that how you look at it ? 
We do n't see it like that . 
And Bogdanich was a brick : he told you you were saying what was not true . 
It 's not pleasant , but what 's to be done , my dear fellow ? 
You landed yourself in it . 
And now , when one wants to smooth the thing over , some conceit prevents your apologizing , and you wish to make the whole affair public . 
You are offended at being put on duty a bit , but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer ? 
Whatever Bogdanich may be , anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel !
