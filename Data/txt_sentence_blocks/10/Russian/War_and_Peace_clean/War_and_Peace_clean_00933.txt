Natasha 's prediction proved true . 
Dolokhov , who did not usually care for the society of ladies , began to come often to the house , and the question for whose sake he came -LRB- though no one spoke of it -RRB- was soon settled . 
He came because of Sonya . 
And Sonya , though she would never have dared to say so , knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dolokhov appeared . 
Dolokhov often dined at the Rostovs ' , never missed a performance at which they were present , and went to Iogel 's balls for young people which the Rostovs always attended . 
He was pointedly attentive to Sonya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances without coloring , but even the old countess and Natasha blushed when they saw his looks . 
It was evident that this strange , strong man was under the irresistible influence of the dark , graceful girl who loved another . 
Rostov noticed something new in Dolokhov 's relations with Sonya , but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were . 
`` They 're always in love with someone , '' he thought of Sonya and Natasha . 
But he was not as much at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov as before and was less frequently at home .
