`` Why is n't she dull and ashamed ? '' 
Natasha took the first note , her throat swelled , her chest rose , her eyes became serious . 
At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings , and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same intervals hold for the same time , but which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep . 
Natasha , that winter , had for the first time begun to sing seriously , mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing . 
She no longer sang as a child , there was no longer in her singing that comical , childish , painstaking effect that had been in it before ; but she did not yet sing well , as all the connoisseurs who heard her said : `` It is not trained , but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained . '' 
Only they generally said this some time after she had finished singing . 
While that untrained voice , with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions , was sounding , even the connoisseurs said nothing , but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again . 
In her voice there was a virginal freshness , an unconsciousness of her own powers , and an as yet untrained velvety softness , which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it . 
`` What is this ? '' 
thought Nicholas , listening to her with widely opened eyes .
