He thought of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member . 
He remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings , and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded . 
He recalled his labors on the Legal Code , and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian , and he felt ashamed of himself . 
Then he vividly pictured to himself Bogucharovo , his occupations in the country , his journey to Ryazan ; he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder , and mentally applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs , he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work . 
Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before , and among them at the Rostovs ' with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball . 
Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call , he wanted to see that original , eager girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind , in her own home . 
Natasha was one of the first to meet him . 
She was wearing a dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress . 
She and all the Rostov family welcomed him as an old friend , simply and cordially . 
The whole family , whom he had formerly judged severely , now seemed to him to consist of excellent , simple , and kindly people .
