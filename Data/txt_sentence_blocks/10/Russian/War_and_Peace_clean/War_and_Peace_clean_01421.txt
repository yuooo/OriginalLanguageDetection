See her knife ? 
... '' `` Is n't she a Tartar ! '' 
`` How is it you did n't go head over heels ? '' 
asked the boldest of all , addressing Natasha directly . 
`` Uncle '' dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and , after a glance at his retainers , shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors . 
The serfs all dispersed . 
`` Uncle '' lifted Natasha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch . 
The house , with its bare , unplastered log walls , was not overclean -- it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless -- but neither was it noticeably neglected . 
In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples , and wolf and fox skins hung about . 
`` Uncle '' led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs , then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa , and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa , a worn carpet , and portraits of Suvorov , of the host 's father and mother , and of himself in military uniform .
