Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view -LRB- adopted to gratify the `` heroes '' -RRB- of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders , in order to find this unknown quantity . 
That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army , that is to say , the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army , quite independently of whether they are , or are not , fighting under the command of a genius , in two -- or three-line formation , with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute . 
Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting . 
The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force . 
To define and express the significance of this unknown factor -- the spirit of an army -- is a problem for science . 
This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent -- such as the commands of the general , the equipment employed , and so on -- mistaking these for the real significance of the factor , and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger . 
Only then , expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor , can we hope to define the unknown . 
Ten men , battalions , or divisions , fighting fifteen men , battalions , or divisions , conquer -- that is , kill or take captive -- all the others , while themselves losing four , so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost . 
Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen , and therefore 4x = 15y . 
Consequently x/y = 15/4 .
