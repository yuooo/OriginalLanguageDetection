The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank , the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right . 
Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry , who had to wait . 
At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general . 
The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted , the Austrian argued that not he , but the higher command , was to blame . 
The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited . 
After an hour 's delay they at last moved on , descending the hill . 
The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below , where they were descending . 
In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another , at first irregularly at varying intervals -- trata ... tat -- and then more and more regularly and rapidly , and the action at the Goldbach Stream began . 
Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream , and having stumbled on him in the fog , hearing no encouraging word from their commanders , and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks , and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog , the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted , receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments . 
In this way the action began for the first , second , and third columns , which had gone down into the valley .
