After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream . 
He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed , and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it , leaving to the commander in chief 's discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills , where one of Russia 's oldest generals would be captured or killed , and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills . 
But while himself remaining , he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Bogucharovo and thence to Moscow . 
Princess Mary , alarmed by her father 's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy , could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him . 
She refused to go away and her father 's fury broke over her in a terrible storm . 
He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her . 
Trying to convict her , he told her she had worn him out , had caused his quarrel with his son , had harbored nasty suspicions of him , making it the object of her life to poison his existence , and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him . 
He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her . 
The fact that he did not , as she had feared , order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary . 
She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away .
