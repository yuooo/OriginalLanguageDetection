... '' said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened , and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building . 
`` Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that ... '' `` Ha ha ha ! 
The theater of war ! '' 
said the prince . 
`` I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen . '' 
Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince , who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper , but Princess Mary , forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen , thought that what her father was saying was correct . 
`` When the snow melts they 'll sink in the Polish swamps . 
Only they could fail to see it , '' the prince continued , evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent . 
`` Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner , then things would have taken a different turn ... '' `` But , Prince , '' Dessalles began timidly , `` the letter mentions Vitebsk ... '' `` Ah , the letter ? 
Yes ... '' replied the prince peevishly .
