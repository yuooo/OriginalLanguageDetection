You ask his pardon ? 
I grant it you . 
Lead that man away ! '' 
said he quickly and energetically , and taking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his life , he went with him into the room . 
The soldiers in the yard , hearing the shot , came into the passage asking what had happened , and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits , but the officer sternly checked them . 
`` You will be called in when you are wanted , '' he said . 
The soldiers went out again , and the orderly , who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen , came up to his officer . 
`` Captain , there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen , '' said he . 
`` Shall I serve them up ? '' 
`` Yes , and some wine , '' answered the captain .
