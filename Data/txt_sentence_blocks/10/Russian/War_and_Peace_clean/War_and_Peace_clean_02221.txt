was heard . 
Most of the time , by their officers ' order , the men sat on the ground . 
One , having taken off his shako , carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again ; another , rubbing some dry clay between his palms , polished his bayonet ; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier , while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again . 
Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground , or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield . 
All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits . 
When men were killed or wounded , when rows of stretchers went past , when some troops retreated , and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke , no one paid any attention to these things . 
But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward , words of approval were heard on all sides . 
But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from , and unconnected with , the battle . 
It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday , commonplace occurrences . 
A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment .
