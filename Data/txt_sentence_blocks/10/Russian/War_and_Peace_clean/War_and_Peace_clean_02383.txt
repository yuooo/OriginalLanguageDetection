* `` Bring the boyars to me . '' 
A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars . 
Two hours passed . 
Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation . 
His speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination . 
That speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it . 
He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward Moscow . 
In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the Tsars , at which Russian notables and his own would mingle . 
He mentally appointed a governor , one who would win the hearts of the people . 
Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all .
