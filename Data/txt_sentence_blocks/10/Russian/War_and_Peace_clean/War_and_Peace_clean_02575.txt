Among these was the governor 's wife herself , who welcomed Rostov as a near relative and called him `` Nicholas . '' 
Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise , and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility . 
His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all . 
Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening . 
He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form , but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual , something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces . 
All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed , plump and pleasing little blonde , the wife of one of the provincial officials . 
With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men 's wives were created for them , Rostov did not leave the lady 's side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style , as if , without speaking of it , they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together . 
The husband , however , did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov . 
But the latter 's good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas ' good humor . 
Toward the end of the evening , however , as the wife 's face grew more flushed and animated , the husband 's became more and more melancholy and solemn , as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife 's share increased the husband 's diminished .
