-LRB- 2 -RRB- The purification and reformation of oneself for its reception , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The improvement of the human race by striving for such purification . 
Which is the principal aim of these three ? 
Certainly self-reformation and self-purification . 
Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances . 
But at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us ; and so , led astray by pride , losing sight of this aim , we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive , or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy . 
Illuminism is not a pure doctrine , just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride . 
On this ground Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity , and in the depth of my soul I agreed with him . 
Talking of my family affairs he said to me , `` the chief duty of a true Mason , as I have told you , lies in perfecting himself . 
We often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim , but on the contrary , my dear sir , it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Self-knowledge -- for man can only know himself by comparison , -LRB- 2 -RRB- Self-perfecting , which can only be attained by conflict , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The attainment of the chief virtue -- love of death . 
Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life . ''
