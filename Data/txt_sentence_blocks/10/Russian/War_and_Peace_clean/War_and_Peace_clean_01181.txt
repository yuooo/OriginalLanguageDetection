At the edge of the road stood an oak . 
Probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest , it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they . 
It was an enormous tree , its girth twice as great as a man could embrace , and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred . 
With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically , and its gnarled hands and fingers , it stood an aged , stern , and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees . 
Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest , and this oak , refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine . 
`` Spring , love , happiness ! '' 
this oak seemed to say . 
`` Are you not weary of that stupid , meaningless , constantly repeated fraud ? 
Always the same and always a fraud ? 
There is no spring , no sun , no happiness !
