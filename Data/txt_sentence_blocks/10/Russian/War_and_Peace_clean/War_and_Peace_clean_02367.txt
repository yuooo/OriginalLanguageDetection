In fact , however , though now much farther off than before , the Rostovs all saw Pierre -- or someone extraordinarily like him -- in a coachman 's coat , going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small , beardless old man who looked like a footman . 
That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them , and respectfully touching Pierre 's elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage . 
Pierre , evidently engrossed in thought , could not at first understand him . 
At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated , he recognized Natasha , and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach . 
But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped . 
Natasha 's face , leaning out of the window , beamed with quizzical kindliness . 
`` Peter Kirilovich , come here ! 
We have recognized you ! 
This is wonderful ! '' 
she cried , holding out her hand to him .
