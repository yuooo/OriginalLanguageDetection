It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life . 
He did not even remember how formerly , on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments , it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now , after the lessons he had had in life , allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love . 
Now reason suggested quite the opposite . 
After that journey to Ryazan he found the country dull ; his former pursuits no longer interested him , and often when sitting alone in his study he got up , went to the mirror , and gazed a long time at his own face . 
Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise , who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame . 
She did not now say those former terrible words to him , but looked simply , merrily , and inquisitively at him . 
And Prince Andrew , crossing his arms behind him , long paced the room , now frowning , now smiling , as he reflected on those irrational , inexpressible thoughts , secret as a crime , which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre , with fame , with the girl at the window , the oak , and woman 's beauty and love . 
And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold , stern , and above all unpleasantly logical . 
`` My dear , '' Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say , `` little Nicholas ca n't go out today , it 's very cold . '' 
`` If it were hot , '' Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister , `` he could go out in his smock , but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes , which were designed for that purpose .
