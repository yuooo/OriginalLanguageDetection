`` My head , be it good or bad , must depend on itself , '' said he , rising from the bench , and he rode to Fili where his carriages were waiting . 
The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov 's hut . 
The men , women , and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage . 
Only Malasha , Andrew 's six-year-old granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea , remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room . 
Malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces , uniforms , and decorations of the generals , who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons . 
`` Granddad '' himself , as Malasha in her own mind called Kutuzov , sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven . 
He sat , sunk deep in a folding armchair , and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which , though it was unbuttoned , still seemed to pinch his neck . 
Those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal ; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others . 
His adjutant Kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutuzov , but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen . 
Round the peasant 's deal table , on which lay maps , plans , pencils , and papers , so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table .
