While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn , the crops , and the good weather for harvesting . 
`` Well , it seems to be getting quieter , '' remarked Ferapontov , finishing his third cup of tea and getting up . 
`` Ours must have got the best of it .

It was by now late in the afternoon .
