He has been to the house , you know , and danced with the children . 
Be sure to invite him , my dear .

`` My dear Boris , '' said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna to her son as Countess Rostova 's carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov 's house .

Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all , your future depends on him . 
Remember that , my dear , and be nice to him , as you so well know how to be . ''
