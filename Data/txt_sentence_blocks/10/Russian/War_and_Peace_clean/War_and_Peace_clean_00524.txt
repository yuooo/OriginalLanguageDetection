I do n't vish to destroy my men for your pleasure ! '' 
`` You forget yourself , Colonel . 
I am not considering my own pleasure and I wo n't allow it to be said ! '' 
Taking the colonel 's outburst as a challenge to his courage , the general expanded his chest and rode , frowning , beside him to the front line , as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets . 
They reached the front , several bullets sped over them , and they halted in silence . 
There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line , for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground , as well as that the French were outflanking our left . 
The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle , each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other . 
Both passed the examination successfully . 
As there was nothing to said , and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire , they would have remained there for a long time testing each other 's courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood . 
The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse .
