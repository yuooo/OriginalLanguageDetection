She felt that it was impossible to ask , or to answer , in words . 
Natasha 's face eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly . 
Natasha was gazing at her , but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not ; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart , it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw . 
And suddenly , Natasha 's lips twitched , ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth , and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs . 
Princess Mary understood . 
But she still hoped , and asked , in words she herself did not trust : `` But how is his wound ? 
What is his general condition ? '' 
`` You , you ... will see , '' was all Natasha could say .
