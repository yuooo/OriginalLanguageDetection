He led the mazurka at the Arkharovs ' ball , talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski , visited the English Club , and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had introduced nim . 
His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow . 
But still , as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him , he often spoke about him and about his love for him , letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand , and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor , who was spoken of as the `` angel incarnate . '' 
During Rostov 's short stay in Moscow , before rejoining the army , he did not draw closer to Sonya , but rather drifted away from her . 
She was very pretty and sweet , and evidently deeply in love with him , but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things . 
When he thought of Sonya , during this stay in Moscow , he said to himself , `` Ah , there will be , and there are , many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know . 
There will be time enough to think about love when I want to , but now I have no time . '' 
Besides , it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood . 
He went to balls and into ladies ' society with an affectation of doing so against his will . 
The races , the English Club , sprees with Denisov , and visits to a certain house -- that was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar !
