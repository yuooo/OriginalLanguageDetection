`` No , it will not do , '' she said decidedly , clasping her hands . 
`` No , Mary , really this dress does not suit you . 
I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress . 
Now please , do it for my sake . 
Katie , '' she said to the maid , `` bring the princess her gray dress , and you 'll see , Mademoiselle Bourienne , how I shall arrange it , '' she added , smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure . 
But when Katie brought the required dress , Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass , looking at her face , and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering , ready to burst into sobs . 
`` Come , dear princess , '' said Mademoiselle Bourienne , `` just one more little effort . '' 
The little princess , taking the dress from the maid , came up to Princess Mary . 
`` Well , now we 'll arrange something quite simple and becoming , '' she said . 
The three voices , hers , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's , and Katie 's , who was laughing at something , mingled in a merry sound , like the chirping of birds .
