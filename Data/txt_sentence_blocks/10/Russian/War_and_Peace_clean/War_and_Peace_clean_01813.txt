His pale and mud-stained face -- fair and young , with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes -- was not an enemy 's face at all suited to a battlefield , but a most ordinary , homelike face . 
Before Rostov had decided what to do with him , the officer cried , `` I surrender ! '' 
He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov 's face . 
Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle . 
On all sides , the hussars were busy with the dragoons ; one was wounded , but though his face was bleeding , he would not give up his horse ; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him ; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse . 
In front , the French infantry were firing as they ran . 
The hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners . 
Rostov galloped back with the rest , aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart . 
Something vague and confused , which he could not at all account for , had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him . 
Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars , sent for Rostov , thanked him , and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George 's Cross .
