When Balashev had ended , Napoleon again took out his snuffbox , sniffed at it , and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal . 
The door opened , a gentleman-in-waiting , bending respectfully , handed the Emperor his hat and gloves ; another brought him a pocket handkerchief . 
Napoleon , without giving them a glance , turned to Balashev : `` Assure the Emperor Alexander from me , '' said he , taking his hat , `` that I am as devoted to him as before : I know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities . 
I will detain you no longer , General ; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor . '' 
And Napoleon went quickly to the door . 
Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase . 
After all that Napoleon had said to him -- those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words : `` I will detain you no longer , General ; you shall receive my letter , '' Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him , and would even avoid another meeting with him -- an insulted envoy -- especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger . 
But , to his surprise , Balashev received , through Duroc , an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day . 
Bessieres , Caulaincourt , and Berthier were present at that dinner . 
Napoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably .
