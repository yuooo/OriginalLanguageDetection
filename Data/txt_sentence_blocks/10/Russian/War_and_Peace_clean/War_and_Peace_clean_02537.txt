Ooh ! '' 
lamented Aniska , who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings . 
Pierre rushed to the wing , but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end , just below the roof , and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen . 
At first Pierre did not realize what these men , who were dragging something out , were about ; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat , he vaguely understood that looting was going on there , but he had no time to dwell on that idea . 
The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings , the whistle and hiss of the flames , the excited shouts of the people , and the sight of the swaying smoke , now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks , with here and there dense sheaves of flame -LRB- now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls -RRB- , and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion , produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration . 
It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down . 
He felt young , bright , adroit , and resolute . 
He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing , when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him . 
Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest , filled with metal articles . 
Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer .
