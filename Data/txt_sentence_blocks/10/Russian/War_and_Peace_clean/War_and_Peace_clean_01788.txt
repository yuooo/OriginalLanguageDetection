No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy 's armies will be in a day 's time , and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment . 
Sometimes -- when there is not a coward at the front to shout , ` We are cut off ! ' 
and start running , but a brave and jolly lad who shouts , ` Hurrah ! ' 
-- a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand , as at Schon Grabern , while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand , as at Austerlitz . 
What science can there be in a matter in which , as in all practical matters , nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions , the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when ? 
Armfeldt says our army is cut in half , and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two fires ; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it , and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength ; Toll proposes one plan , Armfeldt another , and they are all good and all bad , and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial . 
And why do they all speak of a ` military genius ' ? 
Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left ? 
It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power , attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess . 
The best generals I have known were , on the contrary , stupid or absent-minded men .
