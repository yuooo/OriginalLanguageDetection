One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath . 
Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down , and then , testing her strength , ran upstairs again , observing the result . 
Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled , so she called again -- though she could hear Dunyasha coming -- called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing , sing , and listened attentively to herself . 
She did not know and would not have believed it , but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable , delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting , which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed . 
The wound had begun to heal from within . 
At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow , and the count insisted on Natasha 's going with her to consult the doctors . 
After the encounter at Vyazma , where Kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on , the farther movement of the fleeing French , and of the Russians who pursued them , continued as far as Krasnoe without a battle . 
The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with them ; cavalry and artillery horses broke down , and the information received of the movements of the French was never reliable . 
The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any faster . 
To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that , while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners , the Russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty thousand .
