Dolokhov , as if he had not heard the question , did not reply , but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from Cossacks . 
`` Those brigands are everywhere , '' replied an officer from behind the fire . 
Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself , `` but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments ? '' 
he added inquiringly . 
No one replied . 
`` Well , now he 'll come away , '' Petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk . 
But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion , how many battalions , and how many prisoners . 
Asking about the Russian prisoners with that detachment , Dolokhov said : `` A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one ! 
It would be better to shoot such rabble , '' and burst into loud laughter , so strange that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise , and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire . 
No one replied a word to Dolokhov 's laughter , and a French officer whom they could not see -LRB- he lay wrapped in a greatcoat -RRB- rose and whispered something to a companion .
