exclaimed the mother . 
After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov , Countess Rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes . 
At last she rang . 
`` What is the matter with you , my dear ? '' 
she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes . 
`` Do n't you wish to serve me ? 
Then I 'll find you another place . '' 
The countess was upset by her friend 's sorrow and humiliating poverty , and was therefore out of sorts , a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid `` my dear '' and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness . 
`` I am very sorry , ma'am , '' answered the maid . 
`` Ask the count to come to me . ''
