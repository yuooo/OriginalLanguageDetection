The old count 's hospitality and good nature , which struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise , were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner . 
`` Yes , '' he thought , `` they are capital people , who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in Natasha ; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic , charming girl , overflowing with life ! '' 
In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him , a different world , that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him . 
Now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him , but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment . 
After dinner Natasha , at Prince Andrew 's request , went to the clavichord and began singing . 
Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her . 
In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him , a thing he had thought impossible for him . 
He looked at Natasha as she sang , and something new and joyful stirred in his soul . 
He felt happy and at the same time sad . 
He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep .
