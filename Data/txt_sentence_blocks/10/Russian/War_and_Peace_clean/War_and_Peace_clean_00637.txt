Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story , heard from her aunt but finished in her own way , which she liked to repeat to herself . 
It was the story of a girl who had been seduced , and to whom her poor mother -LRB- sa pauvre mere -RRB- appeared , and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him , her seducer . 
And now he , a real Russian prince , had appeared . 
He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her . 
So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne 's head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris . 
It was not calculation that guided her -LRB- she did not even for a moment consider what she should do -RRB- , but all this had long been familiar to her , and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible . 
The little princess , like an old war horse that hears the trumpet , unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition , prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry , without any ulterior motive or any struggle , but with naive and lighthearted gaiety . 
Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women , his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women . 
Besides that , he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions .
