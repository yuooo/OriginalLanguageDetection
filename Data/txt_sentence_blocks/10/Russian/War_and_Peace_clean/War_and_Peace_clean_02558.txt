`` The path to Warsaw , perhaps , '' Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly . 
Everybody looked at him , understanding what he meant . 
Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise . 
He knew no more than the others what his words meant . 
During his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty , and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head . 
`` It may turn out very well , '' he thought , `` but if not , they 'll know how to arrange matters . '' 
And really , during the awkward silence that ensued , that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert , and she , smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte , invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin . 
Everyone became silent . 
`` Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor ! '' 
Prince Vasili sternly declaimed , looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary .
