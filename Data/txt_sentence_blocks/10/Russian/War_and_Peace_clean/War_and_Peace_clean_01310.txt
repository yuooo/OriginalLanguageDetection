`` I know your sister too little , '' replied Prince Andrew , with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment , `` to be able to solve so delicate a question , and then I have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be , '' he added , and looked up Pierre who was just approaching them . 
`` Yes , that is true , Prince .

Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent . 
`` You are friendly with Boris , are n't you ? ''
