`` Carrot ices . '' 
`` No ! 
What kind , Marya Dmitrievna ? 
What kind ? '' 
she almost screamed ; `` I want to know ! '' 
Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing , and all the guests joined in . 
Everyone laughed , not at Marya Dmitrievna 's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion . 
Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice . 
Before the ices , champagne was served round . 
The band again struck up , the count and countess kissed , and the guests , leaving their seats , went up to `` congratulate '' the countess , and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count , with the children , and with one another .
