`` How lovely ! '' 
said everyone who saw her ; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile . 
`` Madame , I doubt my ability before such an audience , '' said he , smilingly inclining his head . 
The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary . 
She smilingly waited . 
All the time the story was being told she sat upright , glancing now at her beautiful round arm , altered in shape by its pressure on the table , now at her still more beautiful bosom , on which she readjusted a diamond necklace . 
From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress , and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna , at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor 's face , and again relapsed into her radiant smile . 
The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene . 
`` Wait a moment , I 'll get my work ... . 
Now then , what are you thinking of ? ''
