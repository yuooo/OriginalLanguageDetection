Historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before . 
They now seemed to rotate on one spot . 
The historical figures at the head of armies , who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars , campaigns , and battles , now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations , laws , and treaties . 
The historians call this activity of the historical figures `` the reaction . '' 
In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who , in their opinion , caused what they describe as the reaction . 
All the well-known people of that period , from Alexander and Napoleon to Madame de Stael , Photius , Schelling , Fichte , Chateaubriand , and the rest , pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction . 
According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia also , and the chief culprit was Alexander I , the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign , being the savior of Russia . 
There is no one in Russian literature now , from schoolboy essayist to learned historian , who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign . 
`` He ought to have acted in this way and in that way . 
In this case he did well and in that case badly .
