He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked , and which might be best described as strength of will . 
Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew 's calm manner of treating everybody , his extraordinary memory , his extensive reading -LRB- he had read everything , knew everything , and had an opinion about everything -RRB- , but above all at his capacity for work and study . 
And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew 's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation -LRB- to which he himself was particularly addicted -RRB- , he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength . 
Even in the best , most friendly and simplest relations of life , praise and commendation are essential , just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly . 
`` My part is played out , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` What 's the use of talking about me ? 
Let us talk about you , '' he added after a silence , smiling at his reassuring thoughts . 
That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre 's face . 
`` But what is there to say about me ? '' 
said Pierre , his face relaxing into a careless , merry smile .
