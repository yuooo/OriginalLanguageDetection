Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August , 1809 . 
It was the time when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy . 
That same August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche , injured his leg , and remained three weeks at Peterhof , receiving Speranski every day and no one else . 
At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society -- abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor -- and not merely these but a whole state constitution , intended to change the existing order of government in Russia : legal , administrative , and financial , from the Council of State down to the district tribunals . 
Now those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne , and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates , Czartoryski , Novosiltsev , Kochubey , and Strogonov -- whom he himself in jest had called his Comite de salut public -- were taking shape and being realized . 
Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side , and Arakcheev on the military . 
Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew , as a gentleman of the chamber , presented himself at court and at a levee . 
The Emperor , though he met him twice , did not favor him with a single word .
