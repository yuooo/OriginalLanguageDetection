He went to the cot in confusion , sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby . 
He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened , restless eyes could not find the baby . 
At last he saw him : the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow , and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly . 
Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that , as if he had already lost him . 
He bent over him and , as his sister had taught him , tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish . 
The soft forehead was moist . 
Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand ; even the hair was wet , so profusely had the child perspired . 
He was not dead , but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent . 
Prince Andrew longed to snatch up , to squeeze , to hold to his heart , this helpless little creature , but dared not do so . 
He stood over him , gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket .
