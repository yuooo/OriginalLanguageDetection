The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka . 
Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance . 
Denisov sat down by the old ladies and , leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot , told them something funny and kept them amused , while he watched the young people dancing , Iogel with Natasha , his pride and his best pupil , were the first couple . 
Noiselessly , skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes , Iogel flew first across the hall with Natasha , who , though shy , went on carefully executing her steps . 
Denisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not . 
In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostov who was passing : `` This is not at all the thing , '' he said . 
`` What sort of Polish mazuwka is this ? 
But she does dance splendidly . '' 
Knowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka , Nicholas ran up to Natasha : `` Go and choose Denisov . 
He is a real dancer , a wonder ! ''
