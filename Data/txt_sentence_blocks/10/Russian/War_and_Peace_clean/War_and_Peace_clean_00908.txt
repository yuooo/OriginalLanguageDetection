Do you feel it ? 
I feel so strange . 
And do you know , Mary , I am going to love him very much , '' said Lise , looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law . 
Princess Mary could not lift her head , she was weeping . 
`` What is the matter , Mary ? '' 
`` Nothing ... only I feel sad ... sad about Andrew , '' she said , wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law 's knee . 
Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law , and every time began to cry . 
Unobservant as was the little princess , these tears , the cause of which she did not understand , agitated her . 
She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something . 
Before dinner the old prince , of whom she was always afraid , came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word .
