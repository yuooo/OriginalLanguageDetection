The head of the French column , with its officers leading , appeared from below the hill . 
`` Forward , with God ! '' 
said Bagration , in a resolute , sonorous voice , turning for a moment to the front line , and slightly swinging his arms , he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman . 
Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward , and experienced great happiness . 
The French were already near . 
Prince Andrew , walking beside Bagration , could clearly distinguish their bandoliers , red epaulets , and even their faces . 
-LRB- He distinctly saw an old French officer who , with gaitered legs and turned-out toes , climbed the hill with difficulty . -RRB- 
Prince Bagration gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks . 
Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French , smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks , and musket shots sounded . 
Several of our men fell , among them the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently .
