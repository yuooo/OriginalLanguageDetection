`` Good day , your honor ! '' 
he shouted , rolling his eyes at Rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities . 
`` Get him to his place and give him some water , '' said Rostov , pointing to the Cossack . 
`` Yes , your honor , '' the soldier replied complacently , and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter , but did not move . 
`` No , it 's impossible to do anything here , '' thought Rostov , lowering his eyes , and he was going out , but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right , and he turned . 
Close to the corner , on an overcoat , sat an old , unshaven , gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton , with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostov . 
The man 's neighbor on one side whispered something to him , pointing at Rostov , who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him . 
He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him , the other had been amputated above the knee . 
His neighbor on the other side , who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back , was a young soldier with a snub nose . 
His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back .
