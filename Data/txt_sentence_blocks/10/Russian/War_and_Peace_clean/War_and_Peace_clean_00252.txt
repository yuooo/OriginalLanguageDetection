A thousand thanks , dear friend , for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow . 
Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding can not grasp , it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit . 
I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination , giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity . 
Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels . 
Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain ; for how can we , miserable sinners that we are , know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal ? 
Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below . 
Let us try to conform to them and follow them , and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam , the better we shall please God , who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him ; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us , the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit . 
My father has not spoken to me of a suitor , but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasili . 
In regard to this project of marriage for me , I will tell you , dear sweet friend , that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform . 
However painful it may be to me , should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can , without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband .
