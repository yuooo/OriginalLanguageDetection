Boris came to the Rostovs ' box , received their congratulations very simply , and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee 's invitation to her wedding , and went away . 
Natasha with a gay , coquettish smile talked to him , and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Boris with whom she had formerly been in love . 
In the state of intoxication she was in , everything seemed simple and natural . 
The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way , and Natasha gave Boris a similar smile . 
Helene 's box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men , who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her . 
During the whole of that entr ` acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov in front of the orchestra partition , looking at the Rostovs ' box . 
Natasha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure . 
She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect . 
Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the stalls . 
The Rostovs had not seen him since their arrival .
