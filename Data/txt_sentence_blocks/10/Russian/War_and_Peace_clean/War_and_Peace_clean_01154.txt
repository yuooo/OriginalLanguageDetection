Boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and , with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met Rostov , tried to enliven the conversation . 
One of the Frenchmen , with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen , addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostov , saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor . 
`` No , I came on business , '' replied Rostov , briefly . 
Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on Boris ' face , and as always happens to those in a bad humor , it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybody 's way . 
He really was in their way , for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general . 
The looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say : `` And what is he sitting here for ? '' 
He rose and went up to Boris . 
`` Anyhow , I 'm in your way , '' he said in a low tone . 
`` Come and talk over my business and I 'll go away . '' 
`` Oh , no , not at all , '' said Boris .
