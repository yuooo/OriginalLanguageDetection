What are the habits of the military ? 
The aim of war is murder ; the methods of war are spying , treachery , and their encouragement , the ruin of a country 's inhabitants , robbing them or stealing to provision the army , and fraud and falsehood termed military craft . 
The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom , that is , discipline , idleness , ignorance , cruelty , debauchery , and drunkenness . 
And in spite of all this it is the highest class , respected by everyone . 
All the kings , except the Chinese , wear military uniforms , and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards . 
`` They meet , as we shall meet tomorrow , to murder one another ; they kill and maim tens of thousands , and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people -LRB- they even exaggerate the number -RRB- , and they announce a victory , supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement . 
How does God above look at them and hear them ? '' 
exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill , piercing voice . 
`` Ah , my friend , it has of late become hard for me to live . 
I see that I have begun to understand too much .
