I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden , and in the garden was a large and beautiful building . 
I woke up . 
O Lord , great Architect of Nature , help me to tear from myself these dogs -- my passions especially the last , which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones , and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream . 
7th December I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house , and that I was very glad and wished to entertain him . 
It seemed as if I chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him , and I wished to come close to him and embrace him . 
But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young , and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order , but so softly that I could not hear it . 
Then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened . 
We were sitting or lying on the floor . 
He was telling me something , and I wished to show him my sensibility , and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me . 
And tears came into my eyes , and I was glad he noticed this .
