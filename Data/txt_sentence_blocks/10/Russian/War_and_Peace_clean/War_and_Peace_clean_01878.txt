Pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants ' hall with tears of emotion in his eyes . 
As became known later , he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice . 
When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants , one of whom Pierre knew , a fat otkupshchik . 
The other was the mayor , a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard . 
Both were weeping . 
Tears filled the thin man 's eyes , and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating : `` Our lives and property -- take them , Your Majesty ! '' 
Pierre 's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything . 
He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it . 
Having heard that Count Mamonov was furnishing a regiment , Bezukhov at once informed Rostopchin that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance . 
Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears , and at once consented to Petya 's request and went himself to enter his name .
