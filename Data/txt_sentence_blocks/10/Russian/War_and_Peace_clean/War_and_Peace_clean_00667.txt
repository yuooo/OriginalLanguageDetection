The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna 's hints at dinner . 
On retiring to her own room , she sat in an armchair , her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox , while the tears kept coming into her eyes . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , with the letter , came on tiptoe to the countess ' door and paused . 
`` Do n't come in , '' she said to the old count who was following her . 
`` Come later . '' 
And she went in , closing the door behind her . 
The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened . 
At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices , then Anna Mikhaylovna 's voice alone in a long speech , then a cry , then silence , then both voices together with glad intonations , and then footsteps . 
Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door . 
Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill .
