When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther , when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just , the historians produce a saving conception of `` greatness . '' 
`` Greatness , '' it seems , excludes the standards of right and wrong . 
For the `` great '' man nothing is wrong , there is no atrocity for which a `` great '' man can be blamed . 
`` C'est grand ! '' 
* say the historians , and there no longer exists either good or evil but only `` grand '' and `` not grand . '' 
Grand is good , not grand is bad . 
Grand is the characteristic , in their conception , of some special animals called `` heroes . '' 
And Napoleon , escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were -LRB- in his opinion -RRB- men he had brought there , feels que c'est grand , * -LSB- 2 -RSB- and his soul is tranquil . 
* `` It is great . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- That it is great .
