The count , Petya , Madame Schoss , Mavra Kuzminichna , and Vasilich came into the drawing room and , having closed the doors , they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another . 
The count was the first to rise , and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon . 
All the others did the same . 
Then the count embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich , who were to remain in Moscow , and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words . 
The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall . 
-LRB- The most precious ones , with which some family tradition was connected , were being taken with them . -RRB- 
In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with swords and daggers , with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened , were taking leave of those remaining behind . 
As is always the case at a departure , much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place , and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in , while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages , the caleche , the phaeton , and back again . 
`` They always will forget everything ! '' 
said the countess .
