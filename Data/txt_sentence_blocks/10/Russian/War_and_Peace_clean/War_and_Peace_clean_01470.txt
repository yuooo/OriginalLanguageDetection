Nicholas , in his old lady 's dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat , stood in the middle of the sleigh , reins in hand . 
It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses , who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof . 
Natasha , Sonya , Madame Schoss , and two maids got into Nicholas ' sleigh ; Dimmler , his wife , and Petya , into the old count 's , and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs . 
`` You go ahead , Zakhar ! '' 
shouted Nicholas to his father 's coachman , wishing for a chance to race past him . 
The old count 's troyka , with Dimmler and his party , started forward , squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow , its deep-toned bell clanging . 
The side horses , pressing against the shafts of the middle horse , sank in the snow , which was dry and glittered like sugar , and threw it up . 
Nicholas set off , following the first sleigh ; behind him the others moved noisily , their runners squeaking . 
At first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road . 
While they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight , but as soon as they were past the fence , the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows .
