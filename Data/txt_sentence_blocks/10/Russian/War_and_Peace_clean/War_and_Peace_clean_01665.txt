Dolokhov , after Anatole entered , had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it . 
With a last desperate effort Dolokhov pushed the porter aside , and when Anatole ran back seized him by the arm , pulled him through the wicket , and ran back with him to the troyka . 
Marya Dmitrievna , having found Sonya weeping in the corridor , made her confess everything , and intercepting the note to Natasha she read it and went into Natasha 's room with it in her hand . 
`` You shameless good-for-nothing ! '' 
said she . 
`` I wo n't hear a word . '' 
Pushing back Natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes , she locked her in ; and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening , but not to let them out again , and having told the footman to bring them up to her , she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors . 
When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again , she rose frowning , and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do . 
Toward midnight she went to Natasha 's room fingering the key in her pocket .
