Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess , but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him . 
`` There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant , mon cousin , '' she replied , `` and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this ... '' `` Yes , yes , of course , '' interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently , rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away . 
`` But ... in short , the fact is ... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property , not to us his direct heirs , but to Pierre . '' 
`` He has made wills enough ! '' 
quietly remarked the princess . 
`` But he can not leave the estate to Pierre . 
Pierre is illegitimate . '' 
`` But , my dear , '' said Prince Vasili suddenly , clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly : `` what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre 's legitimation ? 
Do you understand that in consideration of the count 's services , his request would be granted ? 
... '' The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with .
