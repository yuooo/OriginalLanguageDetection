`` But that 's impossible , '' said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago . 
Pierre looked at him in surprise . 
`` And yet they say that war is like a game of chess ? '' 
he remarked . 
`` Yes , '' replied Prince Andrew , `` but with this little difference , that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time , and with this difference too , that a knight is always stronger than a pawn , and two pawns are always stronger than one , while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company . 
The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone . 
Believe me , '' he went on , `` if things depended on arrangements made by the staff , I should be there making arrangements , but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen , and I consider that on us tomorrow 's battle will depend and not on those others ... . 
Success never depends , and never will depend , on position , or equipment , or even on numbers , and least of all on position . '' 
`` But on what then ? '' 
`` On the feeling that is in me and in him , '' he pointed to Timokhin , `` and in each soldier . ''
