She is like a sister to me , and I ca n't tell you how it offended me ... because ... well , for that reason ... '' Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at Rostov , as was his way at moments of deep feeling . 
`` Ah , what a mad bweed you Wostovs are ! '' 
he muttered , and Rostov noticed tears in his eyes . 
In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor 's arrival , but Rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein , as the Pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place . 
They were bivouacking . 
Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut , dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf . 
The hut was made in the following manner , which had then come into vogue . 
A trench was dug three and a half feet wide , four feet eight inches deep , and eight feet long . 
At one end of the trench , steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule . 
The trench itself was the room , in which the lucky ones , such as the squadron commander , had a board , lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance , to serve as a table .
