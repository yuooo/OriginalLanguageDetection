It 's wonderful how they shine ! 
You would think the women had spread out their linen , '' said one of the men , gazing with admiration at the Milky Way . 
`` That 's a sign of a good harvest next year . '' 
`` We shall want some more wood . '' 
`` You warm your back and your belly gets frozen . 
That 's queer . '' 
`` O Lord ! '' 
`` What are you pushing for ? 
Is the fire only for you ? 
Look how he 's sprawling ! ''
