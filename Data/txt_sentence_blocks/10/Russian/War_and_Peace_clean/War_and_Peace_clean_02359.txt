The countess , tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey , was pacing up and down the drawing room , waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting . 
Natasha was not in the room . 
`` Mamma , '' said Sonya , `` Prince Andrew is here , mortally wounded . 
He is going with us . '' 
The countess opened her eyes in dismay and , seizing Sonya 's arm , glanced around . 
`` Natasha ? '' 
she murmured . 
At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them . 
They knew their Natasha , and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked . 
`` Natasha does not know yet , but he is going with us , '' said Sonya .
