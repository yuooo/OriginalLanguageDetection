Dolokhov cut him short , as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest . 
`` When am I to receive the money , Count ? '' 
Rostov , flushing , drew Dolokhov into the next room . 
`` I can not pay it all immediately . 
Will you take an I.O.U. ? '' 
he said . 
`` I say , Rostov , '' said Dolokhov clearly , smiling and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes , `` you know the saying , ` Lucky in love , unlucky at cards . ' 
Your cousin is in love with you , I know . '' 
`` Oh , it 's terrible to feel oneself so in this man 's power , '' thought Rostov . 
He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss , he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all , and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow , but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse .
