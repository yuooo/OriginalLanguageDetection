For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move . 
First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her , then Madame Schoss ' familiar whistling snore and Sonya 's gentle breathing . 
Then the countess called to Natasha . 
Natasha did not answer . 
`` I think she 's asleep , Mamma , '' said Sonya softly . 
After short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied . 
Soon after that Natasha heard her mother 's even breathing . 
Natasha did not move , though her little bare foot , thrust out from under the quilt , was growing cold on the bare floor . 
As if to celebrate a victory over everybody , a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall . 
A cock crowed far off and another replied near by .
