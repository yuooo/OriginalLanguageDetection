Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time . 
But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said . 
`` I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski , '' repeated Prince Vasili a third time . 
`` How absent-minded you are , my dear fellow . '' 
Prince Vasili smiled , and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and Helene . 
`` Well , what of it , if you all know it ? '' 
thought Pierre . 
`` What of it ? 
It 's the truth ! ''
