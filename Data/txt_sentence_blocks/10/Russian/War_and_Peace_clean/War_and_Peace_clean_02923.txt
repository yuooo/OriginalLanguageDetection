There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers , who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say . 
`` You see , brothers , I know it 's hard for you , but it ca n't be helped ! 
Bear up ; it wo n't be for long now ! 
We 'll see our visitors off and then we 'll rest . 
The Tsar wo n't forget your service . 
It is hard for you , but still you are at home while they -- you see what they have come to , '' said he , pointing to the prisoners . 
`` Worse off than our poorest beggars . 
While they were strong we did n't spare ourselves , but now we may even pity them . 
They are human beings too . 
Is n't it so , lads ? ''
