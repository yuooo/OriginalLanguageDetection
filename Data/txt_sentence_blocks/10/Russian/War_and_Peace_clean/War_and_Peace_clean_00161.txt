The countess wept too . 
They wept because they were friends , and because they were kindhearted , and because they -- friends from childhood -- had to think about such a base thing as money , and because their youth was over ... . 
But those tears were pleasant to them both . 
Countess Rostova , with her daughters and a large number of guests , was already seated in the drawing room . 
The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes . 
From time to time he went out to ask : `` Has n't she come yet ? '' 
They were expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova , known in society as le terrible dragon , a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank , but for common sense and frank plainness of speech . 
Marya Dmitrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg , and both cities wondered at her , laughed privately at her rudenesses , and told good stories about her , while none the less all without exception respected and feared her . 
In the count 's room , which was full of tobacco smoke , they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto , and about the recruiting . 
None of them had yet seen the manifesto , but they all knew it had appeared .
