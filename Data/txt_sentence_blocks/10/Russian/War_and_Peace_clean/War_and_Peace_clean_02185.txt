In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support , here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench , everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation . 
The intrusion of Pierre 's nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first . 
The soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him . 
The senior artillery officer , a tall , long-legged , pockmarked man , moved over to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity . 
A young round-faced officer , quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the Cadet College , who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him , addressed Pierre sternly . 
`` Sir , '' he said , `` permit me to ask you to stand aside . 
You must not be here . '' 
The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre . 
But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm , but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or , politely making way for the soldiers , paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard , their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy , such as soldiers feel for their dogs , cocks , goats , and in general for the animals that live with the regiment . 
The men soon accepted Pierre into their family , adopted him , gave him a nickname -LRB- `` our gentleman '' -RRB- , and made kindly fun of him among themselves .
