`` Moscow , our ancient capital , the New Jerusalem , receives her Christ '' -- he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her -- `` as a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms , and through the gathering mists , foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule , sings in exultation , ` Hosanna , blessed is he that cometh ! ' '' 
Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice . 
Bilibin attentively examined his nails , and many of those present appeared intimidated , as if asking in what they were to blame . 
Anna Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance , like an old woman muttering the prayer at Communion : `` Let the bold and insolent Goliath ... '' she whispered . 
Prince Vasili continued . 
`` Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors ; humble Faith , the sling of the Russian David , shall suddenly smite his head in his blood-thirsty pride . 
This icon of the Venerable Sergius , the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country 's weal , is offered to Your Imperial Majesty . 
I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence . 
I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just , and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty . ''
