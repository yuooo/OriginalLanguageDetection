Sonya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess ' cruel words , without understanding what was required of her . 
She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors . 
Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice , or for whom . 
She could not help loving the countess and the whole Rostov family , but neither could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love . 
She was silent and sad and did not reply . 
Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother . 
He first implored her to forgive him and Sonya and consent to their marriage , then he threatened that if she molested Sonya he would at once marry her secretly . 
The countess , with a coldness her son had never seen in her before , replied that he was of age , that Prince Andrew was marrying without his father 's consent , and he could do the same , but that she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter . 
Exploding at the word intriguer , Nicholas , raising his voice , told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings , but if that were so , he would say for the last time ... . 
But he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror , and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both .
