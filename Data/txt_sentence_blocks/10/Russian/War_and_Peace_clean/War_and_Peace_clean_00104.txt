Having said this he glanced at Natasha . 
She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother , who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter , and unable to control herself any longer , she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her . 
Boris did not laugh . 
`` You were meaning to go out , were n't you , Mamma ? 
Do you want the carriage ? '' 
he asked his mother with a smile . 
`` Yes , yes , go and tell them to get it ready , '' she answered , returning his smile . 
Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha . 
The plump boy ran after them angrily , as if vexed that their program had been disturbed . 
The only young people remaining in the drawing room , not counting the young lady visitor and the countess ' eldest daughter -LRB- who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person -RRB- , were Nicholas and Sonya , the niece .
