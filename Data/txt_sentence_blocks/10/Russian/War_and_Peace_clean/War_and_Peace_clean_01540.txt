`` It is a ray of light in the darkness , a shade between sadness and despair , showing the possibility of consolation . '' 
In reply Boris wrote these lines : Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible , Toi , sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible , Tendre melancholie , ah , viens me consoler , Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite , Et mele une douceur secrete A ces pleurs que je sens couler . 
* * Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul , Thou , without whom happiness would for me be impossible , Tender melancholy , ah , come to console me , Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat , And mingle a secret sweetness With these tears that I feel to be flowing . 
For Boris , Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp . 
Boris read Poor Liza aloud to her , and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him . 
Meeting at large gatherings Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent people . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , who often visited the Karagins , while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie 's dowry -LRB- she was to have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests -RRB- . 
Anna Mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie with emotion , and resignation to the Divine will . 
`` You are always charming and melancholy , my dear Julie , '' she said to the daughter . 
`` Boris says his soul finds repose at your house .
