He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot . 
He did not look round , but still gazing at the infant 's face listened to his regular breathing . 
The dark shadow was Princess Mary , who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps , lifted the curtain , and dropped it again behind her . 
Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her . 
She pressed it . 
`` He has perspired , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I was coming to tell you so . '' 
The child moved slightly in his sleep , smiled , and rubbed his forehead against the pillow . 
Prince Andrew looked at his sister . 
In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them .
