The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was Boris Drubetskoy , who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage . 
The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this : `` Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance Bonaparte , and to cause me , and us in general , annoyance and mortification , our opinion of Bonaparte can not alter . 
We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject , and can only say to the King Prussia and others : ` So much the worse for you . 
Tu l'as voulu , George Dandin , ' that 's all we have to say about it ! '' 
When Boris , who was to be served up to the guests , entered the drawing room , almost all the company had assembled , and the conversation , guided by Anna Pavlovna , was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her . 
Boris , grown more manly and looking fresh , rosy and self-possessed , entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle . 
Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know , giving him a whispered description of each . 
`` Prince Hippolyte Kuragin , M. Krug , the charge d'affaires from Copenhagen -- a profound intellect , '' and simply , `` Mr. Shitov -- a man of great merit '' -- this of the man usually so described . 
Thanks to Anna Mikhaylovna 's efforts , his own tastes , and the peculiarities of his reserved nature , Boris had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously . 
He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage , had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia , and had just returned from there as a special messenger .
