Nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse . 
Suddenly the wolf 's whole physiognomy changed : she shuddered , seeing what she had probably never seen before -- human eyes fixed upon her -- and turning her head a little toward Rostov , she paused . 
`` Back or forward ? 
Eh , no matter , forward ... '' the wolf seemed to say to herself , and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet , long , easy yet resolute lope . 
`` Ulyulyu ! '' 
cried Nicholas , in a voice not his own , and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill , leaping over gullies to head off the wolf , and the borzois passed it , running faster still . 
Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping , nor see the borzois , nor the ground over which he went : he saw only the wolf , who , increasing her speed , bounded on in the same direction along the hollow . 
The first to come into view was Milka , with her black markings and powerful quarters , gaining upon the wolf . 
Nearer and nearer ... now she was ahead of it ; but the wolf turned its head to face her , and instead of putting on speed as she usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs . 
`` Ulyulyulyulyu ! ''
