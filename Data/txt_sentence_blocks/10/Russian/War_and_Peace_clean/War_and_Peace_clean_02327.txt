Madame Schoss , who had been out to visit her daughter , increased the countess ' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer 's in Myasnitski Street . 
When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop . 
She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store , having received orders to do so . 
After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure . 
The old count , suddenly setting to work , kept passing from the yard to the house and back again , shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people , and flurrying them still more . 
Petya directed things in the yard . 
Sonya , owing to the count 's contradictory orders , lost her head and did not know what to do . 
The servants ran noisily about the house and yard , shouting and disputing . 
Natasha , with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too . 
At first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically .
