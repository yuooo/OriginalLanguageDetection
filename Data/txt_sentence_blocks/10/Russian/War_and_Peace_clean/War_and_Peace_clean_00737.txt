It was past midnight . 
Prince Andrew went out . 
The council of war , at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to , left on him a vague and uneasy impression . 
Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother , or Kutuzov , Langeron , and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack , were right -- he did not know . 
`` But was it really not possible for Kutuzov to state his views plainly to the Emperor ? 
Is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives , and my life , my life , '' he thought , `` must be risked ? '' 
`` Yes , it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow , '' he thought . 
And suddenly , at this thought of death , a whole series of most distant , most intimate , memories rose in his imagination : he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife ; he remembered the days when he first loved her . 
He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself , and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it . 
The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously .
