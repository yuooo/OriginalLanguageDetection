At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from Nicholas . 
He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts , but that letter did not set the countess at ease . 
Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Petya . 
Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs ' acquaintances had left Moscow , and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible , she would not bear of leaving before her treasure , her adored Petya , returned . 
On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived . 
The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old officer . 
Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing , Petya guessed her designs , and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her -- might `` become womanish '' as he termed it to himself -- he treated her coldly , avoided her , and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness , almost lover-like . 
Owing to the count 's customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth . 
From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion . 
Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino were brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow , and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates .
