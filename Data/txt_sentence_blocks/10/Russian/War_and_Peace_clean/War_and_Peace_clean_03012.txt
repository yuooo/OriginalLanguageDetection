I know it all . 
I know I am not worthy of her , I know it 's impossible to speak of it now . 
But I want to be a brother to her . 
No , not that , I do n't , I ca n't ... '' He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands . 
`` Well , '' he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence . 
`` I do n't know when I began to love her , but I have loved her and her alone all my life , and I love her so that I can not imagine life without her . 
I can not propose to her at present , but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that possibility ... that possibility ... is terrible . 
Tell me , can I hope ? 
Tell me what I am to do , dear princess ! '' 
he added after a pause , and touched her hand as she did not reply .
