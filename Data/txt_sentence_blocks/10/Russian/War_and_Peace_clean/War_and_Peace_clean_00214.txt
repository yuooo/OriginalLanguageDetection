she said , touching his arm as she had done her son 's when speaking to him that afternoon , `` believe me I suffer no less than you do , but be a man ! '' 
`` But really , had n't I better go away ? '' 
he asked , looking kindly at her over his spectacles . 
`` Ah , my dear friend !

She sighed . 
`` I have loved you like a son from the first . 
Trust yourself to me , Pierre .
