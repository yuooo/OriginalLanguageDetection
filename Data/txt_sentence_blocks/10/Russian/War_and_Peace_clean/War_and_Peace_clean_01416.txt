`` Erza , darling ! '' 
Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own . 
Erza did not hearken to his appeal . 
At the very moment when she would have seized her prey , the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble . 
Again Erza and Milka were abreast , running like a pair of carriage horses , and began to overtake the hare , but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly . 
`` Rugay , Rugayushka ! 
That 's it , come on ! '' 
came a third voice just then , and `` Uncle 's '' red borzoi , straining and curving its back , caught up with the two foremost borzois , pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain , put on speed close to the hare , knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield , again put on speed still more viciously , sinking to his knees in the muddy field , and all one could see was how , muddying his back , he rolled over with the hare . 
A ring of borzois surrounded him . 
A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs .
