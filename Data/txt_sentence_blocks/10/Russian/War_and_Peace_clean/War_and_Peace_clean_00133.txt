`` But I have promised and will do it for your sake . '' 
Although the hall porter saw someone 's carriage standing at the entrance , after scrutinizing the mother and son -LRB- who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches -RRB- and looking significantly at the lady 's old cloak , he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses , and , hearing that they wished to see the count , said his excellency was worse today , and that his excellency was not receiving anyone . 
`` We may as well go back , '' said the son in French . 
`` My dear ! '' 
exclaimed his mother imploringly , again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him . 
Boris said no more , but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak . 
`` My friend , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones , addressing the hall porter , `` I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill ... that 's why I have come ... I am a relation . 
I shall not disturb him , my friend ... I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich : he is staying here , is he not ? 
Please announce me . '' 
The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs , and turned away .
