`` Soyez tranquille , Lise , you will always be prettier than anyone else , '' replied Anna Pavlovna . 
`` You know , '' said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French , turning to a general , `` my husband is deserting me ? 
He is going to get himself killed . 
Tell me what this wretched war is for ? '' 
she added , addressing Prince Vasili , and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter , the beautiful Helene . 
`` What a delightful woman this little princess is ! '' 
said Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna . 
One of the next arrivals was a stout , heavily built young man with close-cropped hair , spectacles , the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time , a very high ruffle , and a brown dress coat . 
This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov , a well-known grandee of Catherine 's time who now lay dying in Moscow . 
The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service , as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated , and this was his first appearance in society .
