`` Lazarev ! '' 
the colonel called , with a frown , and Lazarev , the first soldier in the rank , stepped briskly forward . 
`` Where are you off to ? 
Stop here ! '' 
voices whispered to Lazarev who did not know where to go . 
Lazarev stopped , casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm . 
His face twitched , as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks . 
Napoleon slightly turned his head , and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something . 
The members of his suite , guessing at once what he wanted , moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another , and a page -- the same one Rostov had seen the previous evening at Boris ' -- ran forward and , bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment , laid in it an Order on a red ribbon .
