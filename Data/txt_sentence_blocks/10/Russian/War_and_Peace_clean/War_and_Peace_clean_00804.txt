`` Not Kutuzov , but what 's his name -- well , never mind ... there are not many left alive . 
Go that way , to that village , all the commanders are there , '' said the officer , pointing to the village of Hosjeradek , and he walked on . 
Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going . 
The Emperor was wounded , the battle lost . 
It was impossible to doubt it now . 
Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him , in which he saw turrets and a church . 
What need to hurry ? 
What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov , even if they were alive and unwounded ? 
`` Take this road , your honor , that way you will be killed at once ! '' 
a soldier shouted to him .
