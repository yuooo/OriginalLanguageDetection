Pierre took no notice of them . 
He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else . 
Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly . 
Glowing with the heat and from running , he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth , animation , and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child . 
She had now become quiet and , clinging with her little hands to Pierre 's coat , sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal . 
He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile . 
He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened , sickly little face . 
He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them . 
He walked among the crowd with rapid steps , scanning the various faces he met . 
Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type , wearing a new , cloth-covered , sheepskin coat and new boots , an old woman of similar type , and a young woman .
