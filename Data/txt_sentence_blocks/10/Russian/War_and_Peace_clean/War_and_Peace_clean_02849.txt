`` And here 's the commander , '' said Likhachev . 
Denisov came out of the watchman 's hut and , having called Petya , gave orders to get ready . 
The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness , tightened their saddle girths , and formed companies . 
Denisov stood by the watchman 's hut giving final orders . 
The infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn , hundreds of feet splashing through the mud . 
The esaul gave some orders to his men . 
Petya held his horse by the bridle , impatiently awaiting the order to mount . 
His face , having been bathed in cold water , was all aglow , and his eyes were particularly brilliant . 
Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically . 
`` Well , is ev ` wything weady ? ''
