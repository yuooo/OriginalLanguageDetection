`` How she understands children ! 
It is as if she saw straight into their souls . 
Yesterday , for instance , Mitya was naughty ... '' `` How like his father he is , '' Pierre interjected . 
Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya 's likeness to Nicholas : the recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what Natasha thought of it . 
`` Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted . 
But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line , '' said she , repeating words Pierre had once uttered . 
`` No , the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement -- almost a pastime , '' said Pierre . 
`` For instance , he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought -- Sismondi and Rousseau and Montesquieu , '' he added with a smile . 
`` You know how much I. . . '' 
he began to soften down what he had said ; but Natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary .
