Bezukhov got off scotfree , while Fedya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders . 
Fancy what he had to go through ! 
It 's true he has been reinstated , but how could they fail to do that ? 
I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he . 
And now -- this duel ! 
Have these people no feeling , or honor ? 
Knowing him to be an only son , to challenge him and shoot so straight ! 
It 's well God had mercy on us . 
And what was it for ? 
Who does n't have intrigues nowadays ?
