`` How do you do , cousin ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` You do n't recognize me ? '' 
`` I recognize you only too well , too well . '' 
`` How is the count ? 
Can I see him ? '' 
asked Pierre , awkwardly as usual , but unabashed . 
`` The count is suffering physically and mentally , and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings . '' 
`` Can I see the count ? '' 
Pierre again asked .
