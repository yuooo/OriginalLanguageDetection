The children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room . 
At tea all sat in their accustomed places : Nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him ; Milka , the old gray borzoi bitch -LRB- daughter of the first Milka -RRB- , with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever , lay on the armchair beside him ; Denisov , whose curly hair , mustache , and whiskers had turned half gray , sat beside countess Mary with his general 's tunic unbuttoned ; Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess . 
He spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand . 
He told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real , living , and distinct group , but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years . 
But to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society . 
Natasha saw by Pierre 's animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess . 
Denisov , not being a member of the family , did not understand Pierre 's caution and being , as a malcontent , much interested in what was occurring in Petersburg , kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in the Semenovsk regiment , then about Arakcheev , and then about the Bible Society . 
Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things , but Nicholas and Natasha always brought him back to the health of Prince Ivan and Countess Mary Alexeevna . 
`` Well , and all this idiocy -- Gossner and Tatawinova ? '' 
Denisov asked .
