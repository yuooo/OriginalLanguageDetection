That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty , with her sharply outlined , arched , black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft , bright color of her long , beautiful , expressionless face . 
Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space , she , in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head , suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow . 
She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman , and looked from under her long lashes with motionless , large , almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her . 
Evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it . 
Her face struck Pierre and , hurrying along by the fence , he turned several times to look at her . 
When he had reached the fence , still without finding those he sought , he stopped and looked about him . 
With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before , and a group of Russians , both men and women , gathered about him . 
`` Have you lost anyone , my dear fellow ? 
You 're of the gentry yourself , are n't you ? 
Whose child is it ? ''
