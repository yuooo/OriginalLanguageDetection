`` How is he ? 
... '' The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice . 
All were silent or talked in low tones . 
Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn . 
Princess Mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual . 
The guests were reluctant to address her , feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation . 
Count Rostopchin alone kept the conversation going , now relating the latest town news , and now the latest political gossip . 
Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation . 
Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report , only now and then , silently or by a brief word , showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him . 
The tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world .
