came the command . 
Number one jumped briskly aside . 
The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar , and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy , a little smoke showing the spot where it burst . 
The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound . 
Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below , as plainly visible as if but a stone 's throw away , and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off . 
At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds , and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression . 
Two of the enemy 's shots had already flown across the bridge , where there was a crush . 
Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski , who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings .
