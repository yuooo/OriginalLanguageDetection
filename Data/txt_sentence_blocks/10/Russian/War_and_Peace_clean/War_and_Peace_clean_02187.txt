Several of the men , with bright kindly faces , stopped beside Pierre . 
They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else , and the discovery that he did so delighted them . 
`` It 's the business of us soldiers . 
But in a gentleman it 's wonderful ! 
There 's a gentleman for you ! '' 
`` To your places ! '' 
cried the young officer to the men gathered round Pierre . 
The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality . 
The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field , especially to the left where Bagration 's fleches were , but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything . 
Moreover , his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle -- separated from all else -- formed by the men in the battery .
