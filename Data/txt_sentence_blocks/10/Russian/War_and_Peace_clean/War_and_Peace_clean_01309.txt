Vera , having noticed Prince Andrew 's attentions to Natasha , decided that at a party , a real evening party , subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and , seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone , began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister .
