Princess Mary lowered her eyes and , tripping over her skirt , came close up to them . 
So many different eyes , old and young , were fixed on her , and there were so many different faces , that she could not distinguish any of them and , feeling that she must speak to them all at once , did not know how to do it . 
But again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage , and she boldly began her speech . 
`` I am very glad you have come , '' she said without raising her eyes , and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently . 
`` Dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you . 
That is our common misfortune , and I shall grudge nothing to help you . 
I am myself going away because it is dangerous here ... the enemy is near ... because ... I am giving you everything , my friends , and I beg you to take everything , all our grain , so that you may not suffer want ! 
And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here -- that is not true . 
On the contrary , I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow , and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing . 
You shall be given food and lodging . ''
