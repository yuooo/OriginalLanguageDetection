From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages -- twenty times repeated -- of a sonata by Dussek . 
Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch . 
Prince Andrew got out of the carriage , helped his little wife to alight , and let her pass into the house before him . 
Old Tikhon , wearing a wig , put his head out of the door of the antechamber , reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping , and hastily closed the door . 
Tikhon knew that neither the son 's arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day . 
Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tikhon ; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father 's habits had changed since he was at home last , and , having assured himself that they had not , he turned to his wife . 
`` He will get up in twenty minutes . 
Let us go across to Mary 's room , '' he said . 
The little princess had grown stouter during this time , but her eyes and her short , downy , smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever . 
`` Why , this is a palace ! ''
