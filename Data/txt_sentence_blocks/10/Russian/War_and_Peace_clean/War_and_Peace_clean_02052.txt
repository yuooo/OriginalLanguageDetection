He found him reclining in an armchair , still in the same unbuttoned overcoat . 
He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered , marking the place with a knife . 
Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis . 
`` Well , sit down , sit down here . 
Let 's have a talk , '' said Kutuzov . 
`` It 's sad , very sad . 
But remember , my dear fellow , that I am a father to you , a second father ... '' Prince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father 's death , and what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it . 
`` What ... what they have brought us to ! '' 
Kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice , evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince Andrew 's story the condition Russia was in . 
`` But give me time , give me time ! ''
