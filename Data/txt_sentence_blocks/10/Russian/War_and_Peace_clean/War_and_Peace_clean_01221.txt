Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law , Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph Alexeevich . 
This is what he noted in his diary : Moscow , 17th November I have just returned from my benefactor , and hasten to write down what I have experienced . 
Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder . 
No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint . 
From morning till late at night , except when he eats his very plain food , he is working at science . 
He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay . 
I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem , and he responded in the same manner , asking me with a mild smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges . 
I told him everything as best I could , and told him what I had proposed to our Petersburg lodge , of the bad reception I had encountered , and of my rupture with the Brothers . 
Joseph Alexeevich , having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while , told me his view of the matter , which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow . 
He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the order : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The preservation and study of the mystery .
