`` And the little girl , the little girl , what am I to do with her if she 's not theirs ? '' 
said the woman . 
`` What does that woman want ? '' 
asked the officer . 
Pierre was as if intoxicated . 
His elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved . 
`` What does she want ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` She is bringing me my daughter whom I have just saved from the flames , '' said he . 
`` Good-by ! ''
