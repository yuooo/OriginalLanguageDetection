He rode to the keeper 's lodge . 
No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open . 
Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths , and horses and calves were straying in the English park . 
Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse ; some of the glass panes were broken , and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up . 
He called for Taras the gardener , but no one replied . 
Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden , he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit . 
An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat , plaiting a bast shoe . 
He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up . 
He was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on , and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia . 
Prince Andrew rode up to the house .
