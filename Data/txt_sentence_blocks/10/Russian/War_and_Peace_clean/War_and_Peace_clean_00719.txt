Ca n't you do it more gently ? '' 
said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier , and he rode away . 
Rostov saw tears filling the Emperor 's eyes and heard him , as he was riding away , say to Czartoryski : `` What a terrible thing war is : what a terrible thing ! 
Quelle terrible chose que la guerre ! '' 
The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau , within sight of the enemy 's lines , which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing . 
The Emperor 's gratitude was announced to the vanguard , rewards were promised , and the men received a double ration of vodka . 
The campfires crackled and the soldiers ' songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night . 
Denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major , and Rostov , who had already drunk enough , at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor 's health . 
`` Not ` our Sovereign , the Emperor , ' as they say at official dinners , '' said he , `` but the health of our Sovereign , that good , enchanting , and great man ! 
Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French ! ''
