Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer Tushin , who silent and smiling , shifting from one stockinged foot to the other , glanced inquiringly with his large , intelligent , kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer . 
`` The soldiers say it feels easier without boots , '' said Captain Tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position , evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone . 
But before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off . 
He grew confused . 
`` Kindly return to your posts , '' said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity .

The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on . 
Having ridden beyond the village , continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments , they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up , the freshly dug clay of which showed up red .
