The enchanting , middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and , as she herself afterward described it , she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul . 
It was explained to her that this was la grace . 
After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her . 
She confessed to him , and he absolved her from her sins . 
Next day she received a box containing the Sacred Host , which was left at her house for her to partake of . 
A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document . 
All that was done around her and to her at this time , all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant , refined ways , and the state of dove-like purity she was now in -LRB- she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time -RRB- gave her pleasure , but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim . 
And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones , Helene - having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was , after converting her to Catholicism , to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions -LRB- as to which she received indications -RRB- - before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed . 
In her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires . 
And with this aim , in one of her talks with her Father Confessor , she insisted on an answer to the question , in how far was she bound by her marriage ?
