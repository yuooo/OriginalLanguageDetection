`` Now , dear boy , '' said Prince Vasili playfully , `` say ` yes , ' and I 'll write to her myself , and we will kill the fatted calf . '' 
But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech , Pierre , without looking at him , and with a kind of fury that made him like his father , muttered in a whisper : `` Prince , I did not ask you here . 
Go , please go ! '' 
And he jumped up and opened the door for him . 
`` Go ! '' 
he repeated , amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasili 's face . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? 
Are you ill ? '' 
`` Go ! '' 
the quivering voice repeated .
