he asked himself with still greater surprise . 
Prince Andrew was standing before her , saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude . 
She , having raised her head , was looking up at him , flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing . 
And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her . 
She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball . 
Prince Andrew went up to Pierre , and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend 's face . 
Pierre changed places several times during the game , sitting now with his back to Natasha and now facing her , but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend . 
`` Something very important is happening between them , '' thought Pierre , and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game . 
After six rubbers the general got up , saying that it was no use playing like that , and Pierre was released . 
Natasha on one side was talking with Sonya and Boris , and Vera with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew .
