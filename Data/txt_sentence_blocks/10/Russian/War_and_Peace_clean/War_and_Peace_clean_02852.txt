`` The signal ! '' 
said he . 
The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out . 
In an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard , shouts came from various sides , and then more shots . 
At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting , Petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward , not heeding Denisov who shouted at him . 
It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon . 
He galloped to the bridge . 
Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him . 
On the bridge he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind , but he galloped on . 
In front of him soldiers , probably Frenchmen , were running from right to left across the road .
