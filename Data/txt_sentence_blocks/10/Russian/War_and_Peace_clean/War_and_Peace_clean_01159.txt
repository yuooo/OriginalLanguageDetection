It 's all nonsense ! 
I 'll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskoy who drives me to it ! '' 
And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect , Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house . 
`` No , I wo n't miss my opportunity now , as I did after Austerlitz , '' he thought , expecting every moment to meet the monarch , and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought . 
`` I will fall at his feet and beseech him . 
He will lift me up , will listen , and will even thank me . ' 
I am happy when I can do good , but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness , ' '' Rostov fancied the sovereign saying . 
And passing people who looked after him with curiosity , he entered the porch of the Emperor 's house . 
A broad staircase led straight up from the entry , and to the right he saw a closed door . 
Below , under the staircase , was a door leading to the lower floor .
