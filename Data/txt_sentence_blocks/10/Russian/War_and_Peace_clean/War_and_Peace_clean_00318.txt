This was Prince Bolkonski . 
Beside him was his comrade Nesvitski , a tall staff officer , extremely stout , with a kindly , smiling , handsome face and moist eyes . 
Nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him . 
This hussar , with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes , watched the regimental commander 's back and mimicked his every movement . 
Each time the commander started and bent forward , the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner . 
Nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag . 
Kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief . 
On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped . 
His suite , not having expected this , involuntarily came closer to him . 
`` Ah , Timokhin ! ''
