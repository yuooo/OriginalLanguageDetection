Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other . 
Sonya , when he came in , was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down . 
They were dressed alike , in new pale-blue frocks , and were both fresh , rosy , and bright . 
Sonya ran away , but Natasha , taking her brother 's arm , led him into the sitting room , where they began talking . 
They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves . 
Natasha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself , not because what they were saying was amusing , but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter . 
`` Oh , how nice , how splendid ! '' 
she said to everything .
