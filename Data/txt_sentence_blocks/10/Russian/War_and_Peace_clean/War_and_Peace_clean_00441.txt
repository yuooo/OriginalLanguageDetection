What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg ? 
We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna ? '' 
he said . 
`` Prince Auersperg is on this , on our side of the river , and is defending us -- doing it very badly , I think , but still he is defending us . 
But Vienna is on the other side . 
No , the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be , for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up . 
Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia , and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires . '' 
`` But still this does not mean that the campaign is over , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , I think it is . 
The bigwigs here think so too , but they dare n't say so .
