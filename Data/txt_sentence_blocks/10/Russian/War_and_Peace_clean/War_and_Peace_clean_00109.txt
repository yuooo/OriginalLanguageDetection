`` Cousinage -- dangereux voisinage ; '' * she added . 
* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood . 
`` Yes , '' said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished ; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind , `` and how much suffering , how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now ! 
And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy . 
One is always , always anxious ! 
Especially just at this age , so dangerous both for girls and boys . '' 
`` It all depends on the bringing up , '' remarked the visitor . 
`` Yes , you 're quite right , '' continued the countess . 
`` Till now I have always , thank God , been my children 's friend and had their full confidence , '' said she , repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them . 
`` I know I shall always be my daughters ' first confidante , and that if Nicholas , with his impulsive nature , does get into mischief -LRB- a boy ca n't help it -RRB- , he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men . ''
