Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected . 
Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed . 
Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagration 's face at this moment . 
It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water . 
The dull , sleepy expression was no longer there , nor the affectation of profound thought . 
The round , steady , hawk 's eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully , not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured . 
The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration , entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were . 
`` Please , your excellency , for God 's sake ! '' 
he kept saying , glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him . 
`` There , you see ! ''
