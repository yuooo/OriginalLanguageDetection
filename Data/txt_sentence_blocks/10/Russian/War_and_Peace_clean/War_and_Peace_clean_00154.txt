`` Oh , he is in a dreadful state , '' said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage . 
`` He hardly recognizes anybody . '' 
`` I do n't understand , Mamma -- what is his attitude to Pierre ? '' 
asked the son . 
`` The will will show that , my dear ; our fate also depends on it . '' 
`` But why do you expect that he will leave us anything ? '' 
`` Ah , my dear ! 
He is so rich , and we are so poor ! '' 
`` Well , that is hardly a sufficient reason , Mamma ... '' `` Oh , Heaven ! 
How ill he is ! ''
