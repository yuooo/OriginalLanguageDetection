Above the Kolocha , in Borodino and on both sides of it , especially to the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the Kolocha , a mist had spread which seemed to melt , to dissolve , and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything . 
The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist , and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected , flashing back like lightning from the water , from the dew , and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodino . 
A white church could be seen through the mist , and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers , or green ammunition chests and ordnance . 
And all this moved , or seemed to move , as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space . 
Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino , so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left , in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground , clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing , now singly , now several at a time , some translucent , others dense , which , swelling , growing , rolling , and blending , extended over the whole expanse . 
These puffs of smoke and -LRB- strange to say -RRB- the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle . 
`` Puff ! '' 
-- suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white , and `` boom ! '' 
came the report a second later . 
`` Puff !
