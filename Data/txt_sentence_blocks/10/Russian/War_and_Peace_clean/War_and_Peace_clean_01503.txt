Natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation , and so far succeeded that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sonya should not be troubled , while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents ' knowledge . 
Firmly resolved , after putting his affairs in order in the regiment , to retire from the army and return and marry Sonya , Nicholas , serious , sorrowful , and at variance with his parents , but , as it seemed to him , passionately in love , left at the beginning of January to rejoin his regiment . 
After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more depressing than ever , and the countess fell ill from mental agitation . 
Sonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her . 
The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs , which called for some decisive action . 
Their town house and estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold , and for this they had to go to Moscow . 
But the countess ' health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day . 
Natasha , who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully , now grew more agitated and impatient every day . 
The thought that her best days , which she would have employed in loving him , were being vainly wasted , with no advantage to anyone , tormented her incessantly . 
His letters for the most part irritated her .
