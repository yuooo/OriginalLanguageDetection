... Then the general march , and again `` Hurrah ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar . 
Till the Tsar reached it , each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body , but as soon as he came up it became alive , its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed . 
Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices , amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone , hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely , and in front of them two men -- the Emperors . 
Upon them the undivided , tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated . 
The handsome young Emperor Alexander , in the uniform of the Horse Guards , wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back , with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice , attracted everyone 's attention . 
Rostov was not far from the trumpeters , and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach . 
When he was within twenty paces , and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome , happy young face , he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known . 
Every trait and every movement of the Tsar 's seemed to him enchanting .
