said Ilyin . 
`` No , gentlemen , you have had your sleep , but I have not slept for two nights , '' replied the doctor , and he sat down morosely beside his wife , waiting for the game to end . 
Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife , the officers grew still merrier , and some of them could not refrain from laughter , for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts . 
When he had gone , taking his wife with him , and had settled down with her in their covered cart , the officers lay down in the tavern , covering themselves with their wet cloaks , but they did not sleep for a long time ; now they exchanged remarks , recalling the doctor 's uneasiness and his wife 's delight , now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap . 
Several times Rostov , covering his head , tried to go to sleep , but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed , to the accompaniment of unreasoning , merry , childlike laughter . 
It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep , when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of Ostrovna . 
Still laughing and talking , the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar . 
But Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea . 
Day was breaking , the rain had ceased , and the clouds were dispersing . 
It felt damp and cold , especially in clothes that were still moist .
