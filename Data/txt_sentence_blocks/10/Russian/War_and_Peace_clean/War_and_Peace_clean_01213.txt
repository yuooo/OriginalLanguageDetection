Nearly two years before this , in 1808 , Pierre on returning to Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons . 
He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings , enrolled new members , and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters . 
He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms , in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular . 
He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg . 
His life meanwhile continued as before , with the same infatuations and dissipations . 
He liked to dine and drink well , and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved . 
Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions , however , Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it , the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him . 
At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order . 
When he had joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog . 
When he put his foot down it sank in .
