His having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances , and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match , had drawn his particular attention to her . 
When he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful . 
Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time . 
He was , however , preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her . 
But that day 's encounter in church had , he felt , sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind . 
That pale , sad , refined face , that radiant look , those gentle graceful gestures , and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy . 
In men Rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life -LRB- that was why he did not like Prince Andrew -RRB- and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess , but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction . 
`` She must be a wonderful woman . 
A real angel ! '' 
he said to himself .
