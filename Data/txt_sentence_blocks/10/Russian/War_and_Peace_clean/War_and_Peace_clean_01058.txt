During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers . 
Our aim is no longer , as it should be , to avoid or attack the enemy , but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief . 
So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy , who at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden . 
General Buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him . 
Buxhowden pursues us -- we scuttle . 
He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other . 
At last our enemy . 
Buxhowden , catches us and attacks . 
Both generals are angry , and the result is a challenge on Buxhowden 's part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen 's . 
But at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief , and our first foe , Buxhowden , is vanquished ; we can now turn our thoughts to the second , Bonaparte .
