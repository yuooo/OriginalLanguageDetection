The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna . 
The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners , who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself . 
Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests . 
As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat , so Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests , first the vicomte and then the abbe , as peculiarly choice morsels . 
The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d'Enghien . 
The vicomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity , and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte 's hatred of him . 
`` Ah , yes ! 
Do tell us all about it , Vicomte , '' said Anna Pavlovna , with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence : `` Contez nous cela , Vicomte . '' 
The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply . 
Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him , inviting everyone to listen to his tale .
