In the corridor he met Nesvitski , with whom he shared a room , and the wag Zherkov ; they were as usual laughing . 
`` Why are you so glum ? '' 
asked Nesvitski noticing Prince Andrew 's pale face and glittering eyes . 
`` There 's nothing to be gay about , '' answered Bolkonski . 
Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov , there came toward them from the other end of the corridor , Strauch , an Austrian general who on Kutuzov 's staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army , and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening . 
There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily , but Zherkov , pushing Nesvitski aside with his arm , said in a breathless voice , `` They 're coming ! 
... they 're coming ! 
... Stand aside , make way , please make way ! '' 
The generals were passing by , looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions . 
On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress .
