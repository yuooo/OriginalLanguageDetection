The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge , squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel . 
At last the baggage wagons had all crossed , the crush was less , and the last battalion came onto the bridge . 
Only Denisov 's squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy , who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge , for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away . 
At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving . 
Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground , artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen . 
These were the French . 
A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot . 
All the officers and men of Denisov 's squadron , though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions , thought only of what was there on the hilltop , and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline , which they knew to be the enemy 's troops . 
The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it . 
It was calm , and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill .
