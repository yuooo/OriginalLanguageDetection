Something cracked in the flames . 
The fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof . 
There was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed . 
`` Ou-rou-rou ! '' 
yelled the crowd , echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn , the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around . 
The flames flared up again , lighting the animated , delighted , exhausted faces of the spectators . 
The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted : `` It 's fine , lads ! 
Now it 's raging ... It 's fine ! '' 
`` That 's the owner himself , '' cried several voices . 
`` Well then , '' continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych , `` report to them as I have told you '' ; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside him , he touched his horse and rode down the side street .
