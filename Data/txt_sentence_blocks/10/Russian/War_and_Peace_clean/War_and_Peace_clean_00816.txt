The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on . 
The horses moved off the bank . 
The ice , that had held under those on foot , collapsed in a great mass , and some forty men who were on it dashed , some forward and some back , drowning one another . 
Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam , the pond , and the bank . 
On the Pratzen Heights , where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand , lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle , piteous , and childlike moan . 
Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still . 
He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted . 
Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning , lacerating pain in his head . 
`` Where is it , that lofty sky that I did not know till now , but saw today ? '' 
was his first thought .
