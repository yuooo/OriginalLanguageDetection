This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria , the only change being that the words `` Father Kamenski '' were replaced by `` Father Kutuzov . '' 
Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground , the drummer -- a lean , handsome soldier of forty -- looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes . 
Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him , he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and , holding it there for some seconds , suddenly flung it down and began : `` Oh , my bower , oh , my bower ... ! '' 
`` Oh , my bower new ... ! '' 
chimed in twenty voices , and the castanet player , in spite of the burden of his equipment , rushed out to the front and , walking backwards before the company , jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone . 
The soldiers , swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously , marched with long steps . 
Behind the company the sound of wheels , the creaking of springs , and the tramp of horses ' hoofs were heard . 
Kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town . 
The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease , and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men . 
In the second file from the right flank , beside which the carriage passed the company , a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice .
