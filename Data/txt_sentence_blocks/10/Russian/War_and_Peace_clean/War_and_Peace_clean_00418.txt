`` Two , I think . '' 
`` If I were Tsar I would never go to war , '' said Nesvitski , turning away . 
The French guns were hastily reloaded . 
The infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run . 
Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals , and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge . 
But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening there , as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it . 
The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them , no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at . 
The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses . 
Two were misdirected and the shot went too high , but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over . 
Rostov , absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich , had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do .
