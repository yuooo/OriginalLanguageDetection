Above the heights was the dark clear sky , and to the right the vast orb of the sun . 
In front , far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist , some wooded hills were discernible , and it was there the enemy probably was , for something could be descried . 
On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets ; to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist . 
In front and behind moved infantry . 
The commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him . 
That morning Kutuzov seemed worn and irritable . 
The infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given , apparently obstructed by something in front . 
`` Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village ! '' 
he said angrily to a general who had ridden up . 
`` Do n't you understand , your excellency , my dear sir , that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy ? ''
