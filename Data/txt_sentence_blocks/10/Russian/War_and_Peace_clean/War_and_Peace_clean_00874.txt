Rostov was talking merrily to his two friends , one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake , and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre , whose preoccupied , absent-minded , and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner . 
Rostov looked inimically at Pierre , first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian , the husband of a beauty , and in a word -- an old woman ; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had not responded to his greeting . 
When the Emperor 's health was drunk , Pierre , lost in thought , did not rise or lift his glass . 
`` What are you about ? '' 
shouted Rostov , looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation . 
`` Do n't you hear it 's His Majesty the Emperor 's health ? '' 
Pierre sighed , rose submissively , emptied his glass , and , waiting till all were seated again , turned with his kindly smile to Rostov . 
`` Why , I did n't recognize you ! '' 
he said . 
But Rostov was otherwise engaged ; he was shouting `` Hurrah ! ''
