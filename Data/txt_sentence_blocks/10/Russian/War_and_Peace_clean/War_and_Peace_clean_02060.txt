So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow . 
It was long since people had been as gay in Moscow as that year . 
Rostopchin 's broadsheets , headed by woodcuts of a drink shop , a potman , and a Moscow burgher called Karpushka Chigirin , `` who -- having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub -- heard that Napoleon wished to come to Moscow , grew angry , abused the French in very bad language , came out of the drink shop , and , under the sign of the eagle , began to address the assembled people , '' were read and discussed , together with the latest of Vasili Lvovich Pushkin 's bouts rimes . 
In the corner room at the Club , members gathered to read these broadsheets , and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French , saying : `` They will swell up with Russian cabbage , burst with our buckwheat porridge , and choke themselves with cabbage soup . 
They are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork . '' 
Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar . 
It was said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow , and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among them ; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchin 's witty remark on that occasion . 
The foreigners were deported to Nizhni by boat , and Rostopchin had said to them in French : `` Rentrez en vousmemes ; entrez dans la barque , et n'en faites pas une barque de Charon . '' 
* There was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow , and to this Shinshin 's witticism was added -- that for that alone Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon . 
It was said that Mamonov 's regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles , and that Bezukhov had spent even more on his , but that the best thing about Bezukhov 's action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show .
