said Langeron . 
`` He has forty thousand men at most , '' replied Weyrother , with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case . 
`` In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack , '' said Langeron , with a subtly ironical smile , again glancing round for support to Miloradovich who was near him . 
But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about . 
`` Ma foi ! '' 
said he , `` tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield . '' 
Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of , but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of . 
`` The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp , '' said he . 
`` What does that mean ? 
Either he is retreating , which is the only thing we need fear , or he is changing his position . ''
