`` No matter at all , my dear count , '' she said , meekly closing her eyes . 
`` But I 'll go to Bezukhov 's myself . 
Pierre has arrived , and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses . 
I have to see him in any case . 
He has forwarded me a letter from Boris . 
Thank God , Boris is now on the staff . '' 
The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna 's taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her . 
`` Tell Bezukhov to come . 
I 'll put his name down . 
Is his wife with him ? ''
