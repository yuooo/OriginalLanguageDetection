shouted Rostopchin . 
`` Bring him to me ! '' 
Toward nine o'clock in the morning , when the troops were already moving through Moscow , nobody came to the count any more for instructions . 
Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord , those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do . 
The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki , and sat in his study with folded hands , morose , sallow , and taciturn . 
In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going , and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts . 
While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark , holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving , naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to . 
But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move , such a delusion is no longer possible .
