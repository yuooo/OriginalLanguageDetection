`` That 's where I 'm going . 
Shall we join up our packs ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
The hounds were joined into one pack , and `` Uncle '' and Nicholas rode on side by side . 
Natasha , muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes , galloped up to them . 
She was followed by Petya who always kept close to her , by Michael , a huntsman , and by a groom appointed to look after her . 
Petya , who was laughing , whipped and pulled at his horse . 
Natasha sat easily and confidently on her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand . 
`` Uncle '' looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha .
