Dolokhov -- now an officer -- wounded in the arm , and on foot , with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company , represented all that was left of that whole regiment . 
Impelled by the crowd , they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and , jammed in on all sides , had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out . 
A cannon ball killed someone behind them , another fell in front and splashed Dolokhov with blood . 
The crowd , pushing forward desperately , squeezed together , moved a few steps , and again stopped . 
`` Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved , remain here another two minutes and it is certain death , '' thought each one . 
Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam , throwing two soldiers off their feet , and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool . 
`` Turn this way ! '' 
he shouted , jumping over the ice which creaked under him ; `` turn this way ! '' 
he shouted to those with the gun . 
`` It bears !
