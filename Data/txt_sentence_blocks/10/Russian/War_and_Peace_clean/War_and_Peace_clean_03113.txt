`` Two , two ! '' 
they shouted . 
This meant two stockings , which by a secret process known only to herself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles , and which , when they were ready , she always triumphantly drew , one out of the other , in the children 's presence . 
Soon after this the children came in to say good night . 
They kissed everyone , the tutors and governesses made their bows , and they went out . 
Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained . 
Dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs . 
`` No , Monsieur Dessalles , I will ask my aunt to let me stay , '' replied Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper . 
`` Ma tante , please let me stay , '' said he , going up to his aunt . 
His face expressed entreaty , agitation , and ecstasy .
