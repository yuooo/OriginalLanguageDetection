Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova , and Bennigsen and his suite , with Pierre among them , set out on their ride along the line . 
From Gorki , Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which , when they had looked it from the hill , the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside . 
They rode across that bridge into the village of Borodino and thence turned to the left , passing an enormous number of troops and guns , and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging . 
This was the redoubt , as yet unnamed , which afterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt , or the Knoll Battery , but Pierre paid no special attention to it . 
He did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of Borodino . 
They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk , where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns . 
Then they rode downhill and uphill , across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail , following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land , and reached some fleches * which were still being dug . 
* A kind of entrenchment . 
At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino Redoubt opposite , which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried . 
The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat was there , and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen .
