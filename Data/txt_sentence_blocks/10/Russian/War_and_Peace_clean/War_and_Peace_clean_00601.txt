`` I am starting on a journey of inspection , and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time , my honored benefactor , '' wrote Prince Vasili . 
`` My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army , so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that , emulating his father , he feels for you . '' 
`` It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out , suitors are coming to us of their own accord , '' incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news . 
Prince Nicholas frowned , but said nothing . 
A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili 's servants came one evening in advance of him , and he and his son arrived next day . 
Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili 's character , but more so recently , since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors . 
And now , from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess , he saw which way the wind was blowing , and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will . 
He snorted whenever he mentioned him . 
On the day of Prince Vasili 's arrival , Prince Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper . 
Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming , or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili 's visit , he was in a bad temper , and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect not to go the prince with his report .
