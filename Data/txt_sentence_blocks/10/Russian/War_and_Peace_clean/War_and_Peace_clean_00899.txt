`` If you wo n't answer , I 'll tell you ... '' Helene went on . 
`` You believe everything you 're told . 
You were told ... '' Helene laughed , `` that Dolokhov was my lover , '' she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech , uttering the word amant as casually as any other word , `` and you believed it ! 
Well , what have you proved ? 
What does this duel prove ? 
That you 're a fool , que vous etes un sot , but everybody knew that . 
What will be the result ? 
That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow , that everyone will say that you , drunk and not knowing what you were about , challenged a man you are jealous of without cause . '' 
Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited , `` A man who 's a better man than you in every way ... '' `` Hm ... Hm ... ! '' 
growled Pierre , frowning without looking at her , and not moving a muscle .
