This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal , but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself . 
The soldier they called `` Jackdaw , '' a thin little fellow with a sharp nose , rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender , handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood . 
`` Bring it here -- that 's fine ! '' 
They split up the wood , pressed it down on the fire , blew at it with their mouths , and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats , making the flames hiss and crackle . 
The men drew nearer and lit their pipes . 
The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood , setting his arms akimbo , began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood . 
`` Mother ! 
The dew is cold but clear ... . 
It 's well that I 'm a musketeer ... '' he sang , pretending to hiccough after each syllable . 
`` Look out , your soles will fly off ! ''
