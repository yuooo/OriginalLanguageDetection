At the gate stood Gerasim , the cook , and two Frenchmen . 
Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard . 
They were looking at the glow seen in the town . 
There was nothing terrible in the one small , distant fire in the immense city . 
Gazing at the high starry sky , at the moon , at the comet , and at the glow from the fire , Pierre experienced a joyful emotion . 
`` There now , how good it is , what more does one need ? '' 
thought he . 
And suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself from falling . 
Without taking leave of his new friend , Pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep . 
The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the retreating troops , with many different feelings .
