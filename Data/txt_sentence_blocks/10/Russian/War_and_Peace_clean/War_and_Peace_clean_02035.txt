The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one . 
To remember her gave him pleasure , and when his comrades , hearing of his adventure at Bogucharovo , rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia , he grew angry . 
It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary , who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune , had against his will more than once entered his head . 
For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife : by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy , would be able to put his father 's affairs in order , and would even -- he felt it - ensure Princess Mary 's happiness .

And his plighted word ? 
That was why Rostov grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya .
