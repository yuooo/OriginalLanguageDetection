`` Is he really to be my husband , this stranger who is so kind -- yes , kind , that is the chief thing , '' thought Princess Mary ; and fear , which she had seldom experienced , came upon her . 
She feared to look round , it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner . 
And this someone was he -- the devil -- and he was also this man with the white forehead , black eyebrows , and red lips . 
She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening , vainly expecting someone , now smiling at someone , now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall . 
The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made . 
She could not lie either on her face or on her side . 
Every position was awkward and uncomfortable , and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatole 's presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay . 
She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie , sleepy and disheveled , beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time , muttering to herself . 
`` I told you it was all lumps and holes ! ''
