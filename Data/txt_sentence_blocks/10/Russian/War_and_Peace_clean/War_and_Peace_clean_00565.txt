It was they , these soldiers - wounded and unwounded -- it was they who were crushing , weighing down , and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder . 
To rid himself of them he closed his eyes . 
For a moment he dozed , but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream : his mother and her large white hand , Sonya 's thin little shoulders , Natasha 's eyes and laughter , Denisov with his voice and mustache , and Telyanin and all that affair with Telyanin and Bogdanich . 
That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice , and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly , incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction . 
He tried to get away from them , but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair 's breadth . 
It would not ache -- it would be well -- if only they did not pull it , but it was impossible to get rid of them . 
He opened his eyes and looked up . 
The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal . 
Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light . 
Tushin had not returned , the doctor had not come .
