Some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka , the count 's other groom , a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds . 
Before the hunt , by old custom , the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy , taken a snack , and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux . 
He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive . 
His eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual , and as he sat in his saddle , wrapped up in his fur coat , he looked like a child taken out for an outing . 
The thin , hollow-cheeked Chekmar , having got everything ready , kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years , and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat . 
A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood -LRB- it was plain that he had had a lesson -RRB- and stopped behind the count . 
This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman 's cloak , with a tall peaked cap on his head . 
He was the buffoon , who went by a woman 's name , Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Well , Nastasya Ivanovna ! '' 
whispered the count , winking at him .
