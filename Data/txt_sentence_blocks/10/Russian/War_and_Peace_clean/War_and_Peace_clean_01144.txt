`` Here , here , '' and Tushin led him into the next room , from whence came sounds of several laughing voices . 
`` How can they laugh , or even live at all here ? '' 
thought Rostov , still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers ' ward , and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides , and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back . 
Denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket , though it was nearly noon . 
`` Ah , Wostov ? 
How are you , how are you ? '' 
he called out , still in the same voice as in the regiment , but Rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new , sinister , hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of Denisov 's face and the intonations of his voice . 
His wound , though a slight one , had not yet healed even now , six weeks after he had been hit . 
His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients , but it was not this that struck Rostov . 
What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him , and smiled at him unnaturally .
