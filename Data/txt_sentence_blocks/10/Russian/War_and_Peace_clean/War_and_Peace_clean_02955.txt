And this embrace too , owing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings , had its usual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob . 
The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard , and again pressing the old man 's hand went with him into the castle . 
When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at Krasnoe and the Berezina , and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad . 
Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark . 
The same submissive , expressionless look with which he had listened to the Emperor 's commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now . 
When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait , he was arrested by someone 's voice saying : `` Your Serene Highness ! '' 
Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of Count Tolstoy , who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object . 
Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him . 
Suddenly he seemed to remember ; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face , and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver . 
It was the Order of St. George of the First Class .
