Several French officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin through field glasses . 
The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers , and this sound troubled the French . 
They imagined it to be a call to arms . 
A few infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate . 
Beams and wooden screens had been put there , and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it . 
A general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer , and the latter ran back again with his men . 
The sound of three more shots came from the gate . 
One shot struck a French soldier 's foot , and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting . 
Instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the French general , officers , and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering . 
To all of them from the marshal to the least soldier , that place was not the Vozdvizhenka , Mokhavaya , or Kutafyev Street , nor the Troitsa Gate -LRB- places familiar in Moscow -RRB- , but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary .
