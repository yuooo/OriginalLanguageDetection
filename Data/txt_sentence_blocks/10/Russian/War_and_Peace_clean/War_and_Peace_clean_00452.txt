asked the Emperor . 
`` I can not inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the front , but at Durrenstein , where I was , our attack began after five in the afternoon , '' replied Bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account , which he had ready in his mind , of all he knew and had seen . 
But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him . 
`` How many miles ? '' 
`` From where to where , Your Majesty ? '' 
`` From Durrenstein to Krems . '' 
`` Three and a half miles , Your Majesty . '' 
`` The French have abandoned the left bank ? '' 
`` According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night . '' 
`` Is there sufficient forage in Krems ? ''
