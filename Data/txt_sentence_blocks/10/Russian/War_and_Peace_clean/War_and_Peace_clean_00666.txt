`` And I should be ashamed to write to Boris . 
I 'm not going to . '' 
`` Why should you be ashamed ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know . 
It 's awkward and would make me ashamed . '' 
`` And I know why she 'd be ashamed , '' said Petya , offended by Natasha 's previous remark . 
`` It 's because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles '' -LRB- that was how Petya described his namesake , the new Count Bezukhov -RRB- `` and now she 's in love with that singer '' -LRB- he meant Natasha 's Italian singing master -RRB- , `` that 's why she 's ashamed ! '' 
`` Petya , you 're a stupid ! '' 
said Natasha . 
`` Not more stupid than you , madam , '' said the nine-year-old Petya , with the air of an old brigadier .
