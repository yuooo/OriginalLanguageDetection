Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room . 
What so affected him was Kutuzov 's calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen 's proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said Kutuzov , `` I can not approve of the count 's plan . 
Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous , and military history supports that view . 
For instance ... '' Kutuzov seemed to reflect , searching for an example , then with a clear , naive look at Bennigsen he added : `` Oh yes ; take the battle of Friedland , which I think the count well remembers , and which was ... not fully successful , only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy ... '' There followed a momentary pause , which seemed very long to them all . 
The discussion recommenced , but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said . 
During one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak . 
They all looked at him . 
`` Well , gentlemen , I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken crockery , '' said he , and rising slowly he moved to the table . 
`` Gentlemen , I have heard your views .
