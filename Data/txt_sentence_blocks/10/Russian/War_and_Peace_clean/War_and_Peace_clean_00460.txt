* They spin him a thousand gasconades , saying that the war is over , that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte , that they desire to see Prince Auersperg , and so on . 
The officer sends for Auersperg ; these gentlemen embrace the officers , crack jokes , sit on the cannon , and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved , flings the bags of incendiary material into the water , and approaches the tete-de-pont . 
At length appears the lieutenant general , our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself . 
` Dearest foe ! 
Flower of the Austrian army , hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended , we can shake one another 's hand ... . 
The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg 's acquaintance . ' 
In a word , those gentlemen , Gascons indeed , so bewildered him with fine words , and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals , and so dazzled by the sight of Murat 's mantle and ostrich plumes , qu'il n ' y voit que du feu , et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi !
