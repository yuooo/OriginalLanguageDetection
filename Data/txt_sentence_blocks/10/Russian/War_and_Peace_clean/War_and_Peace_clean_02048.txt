But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged . 
He made a grimace ... `` No , tell them to bring a small table out here , my dear boy . 
I 'll look at them here , '' said he . 
`` Do n't go away , '' he added , turning to Prince Andrew , who remained in the porch and listened to the general 's report . 
While this was being given , Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman 's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door . 
Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump , rosy , handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head , holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief . 
Kutuzov 's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was , and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt . 
`` Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church , and she intends to welcome him in the house ... . 
She 's very pretty , '' added the adjutant with a smile . 
At those words Kutuzov looked round .
