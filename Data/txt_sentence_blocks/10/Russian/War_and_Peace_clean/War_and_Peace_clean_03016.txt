Very well , I 'll go . 
But I may come again tomorrow ? '' 
Next day Pierre came to say good-by . 
Natasha was less animated than she had been the day before ; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer , that nothing existed but happiness . 
`` Is it possible ? 
No , it ca n't be , '' he told himself at every look , gesture , and word that filled his soul with joy . 
When on saying good-by he took her thin , slender hand , he could not help holding it a little longer in his own . 
`` Is it possible that this hand , that face , those eyes , all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now , is it possible that it will one day be mine forever , as familiar to me as I am to myself ? 
... No , that 's impossible ! 
... '' `` Good-by , Count , '' she said aloud .
