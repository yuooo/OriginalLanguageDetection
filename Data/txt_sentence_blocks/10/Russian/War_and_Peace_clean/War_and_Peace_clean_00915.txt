The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door with her knitting . 
Princess Mary took a book and began reading . 
Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another , the princess anxious and inquiring , the nurse encouraging . 
Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her room . 
But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers , everyone tried to pretend not to know ; no one spoke of it , but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince 's household , a common anxiety , a softening of the heart , and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt . 
There was no laughter in the maids ' large hall . 
In the men servants ' hall all sat waiting , silently and alert . 
In the outlying serfs ' quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept .

-- `` Say only that ` the prince told me to ask , ' and come and tell me her answer . ''
