You 're quick at taking offense , but you do n't mind disgracing the whole regiment ! '' 
The staff captain 's voice began to tremble . 
`` You have been in the regiment next to no time , my lad , you 're here today and tomorrow you 'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said ` There are thieves among the Pavlograd officers ! ' 
But it 's not all the same to us ! 
Am I not right , Denisov ? 
It 's not the same ! '' 
Denisov remained silent and did not move , but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostov . 
`` You value your own pride and do n't wish to apologize , '' continued the staff captain , `` but we old fellows , who have grown up in and , God willing , are going to die in the regiment , we prize the honor of the regiment , and Bogdanich knows it . 
Oh , we do prize it , old fellow ! 
And all this is not right , it 's not right !
