asked the accountant with a naive smile . 
`` A French pancake , '' answered Zherkov . 
`` So that 's what they hit with ? '' 
asked the accountant . 
`` How awful ! '' 
He seemed to swell with satisfaction . 
He had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft ... f-f-flop ! 
and a Cossack , riding a little to their right and behind the accountant , crashed to earth with his horse . 
Zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away .
