It was in French . 
December 4 . 
Today when Andrusha -LRB- her eldest boy -RRB- woke up he did not wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me . 
He was naughty and obstinate . 
I tried threats , but he only grew angrier . 
Then I took the matter in hand : I left him alone and began with nurse 's help to get the other children up , telling him that I did not love him . 
For a long time he was silent , as if astonished , then he jumped out of bed , ran to me in his shirt , and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time . 
It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me . 
Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket , he again began crying piteously and kissing me . 
One can do anything with him by tenderness .
