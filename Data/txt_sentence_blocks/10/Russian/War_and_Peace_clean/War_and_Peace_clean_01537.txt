Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future sister-in-law as soon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her . 
Boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg , so with the same object in view he came to Moscow . 
There he wavered between the two richest heiresses , Julie and Princess Mary . 
Though Princess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie , he , without knowing why , felt awkward about paying court to her . 
When they had last met on the old prince 's name day , she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally , evidently not listening to what he was saying . 
Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily , though in a manner peculiar to herself . 
She was twenty-seven . 
After the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy . 
She was by now decidedly plain , but thought herself not merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive . 
She was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men , and the more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers , soirees , and the animated company that assembled at her house , without incurring any obligation .
