For five weeks after that there was not a single battle . 
The French did not move . 
As a bleeding , mortally wounded animal licks its wounds , they remained inert in Moscow for five weeks , and then suddenly , with no fresh reason , fled back : they made a dash for the Kaluga road , and -LRB- after a victory -- for at Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs -RRB- without undertaking a single serious battle , they fled still more rapidly back to Smolensk , beyond Smolensk , beyond the Berezina , beyond Vilna , and farther still . 
On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August , Kutuzov and the whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a victory . 
Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor . 
He gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone , but because he knew that the enemy was beaten , as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it . 
But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of unheard-of losses , of the loss of half the army , and a fresh battle proved physically impossible . 
It was impossible to give battle before information had been collected , the wounded gathered in , the supplies of ammunition replenished , the slain reckoned up , new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed , and before the men had had food and sleep . 
And meanwhile , the very next morning after the battle , the French army advanced of itself upon the Russians , carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim . 
Kutuzov 's wish was to attack next day , and the whole army desired to do so .
