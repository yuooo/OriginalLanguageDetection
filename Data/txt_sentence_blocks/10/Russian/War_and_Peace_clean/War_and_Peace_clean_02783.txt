Its first period had passed : when the partisans themselves , amazed at their own boldness , feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the French , and hid in the forests without unsaddling , hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued . 
By the end of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape : it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could not . 
Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs , and moving according to rules at a distance from the French , still regarded many things as impossible . 
The small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the French closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate . 
The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French now considered everything possible . 
On October 22 , Denisov -LRB- who was one of the irregulars -RRB- was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm . 
Since early morning he and his party had been on the move . 
All day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army , which -- as was learned from spies and prisoners - was moving under a strong escort to Smolensk . 
Besides Denisov and Dolokhov -LRB- who also led a small party and moved in Denisov 's vicinity -RRB- , the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and , as Denisov expressed it , were sharpening their teeth for it . 
Two of the commanders of large parties -- one a Pole and the other a German -- sent invitations to Denisov almost simultaneously , requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy .
