Pierre ran down the slope once more . 
`` Now they will stop it , now they will be horrified at what they have done ! '' 
he thought , aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield . 
But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high , and in front and especially to the left , near Semenovsk , something seemed to be seething in the smoke , and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish , but even increased to desperation like a man who , straining himself , shrieks with all his remaining strength . 
The chief action of the battle of Borodino was fought within the seven thousand feet between Borodino and Bagration 's fleches . 
Beyond that space there was , on the one side , a demonstration made by the Russians with Uvarov 's cavalry at midday , and on the other side , beyond Utitsa , Poniatowski 's collision with Tuchkov ; but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield . 
On the field between Borodino and the fleches , beside the wood , the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way . 
The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns . 
Then when the whole field was covered with smoke , two divisions , Campan 's and Dessaix 's , advanced from the French right , while Murat 's troops advanced on Borodino from their left . 
From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the fleches were two thirds of a mile away , and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodino , so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there , especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality .
