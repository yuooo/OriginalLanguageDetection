The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode 's detachment , peasants from the adjacent villages , and residents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity . 
The Russians who entered Moscow , finding it plundered , plundered it in their turn . 
They continued what the French had begun . 
Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets . 
The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps , and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own , pretending that it was their property . 
But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent , and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms . 
The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life , with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship , with luxury , and governmental and religious institutions . 
These forms were lifeless but still existed . 
There were bazaars , shops , warehouses , market stalls , granaries -- for the most part still stocked with goods -- and there were factories and workshops , palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries , hospitals , prisons , government offices , churches , and cathedrals . 
The longer the French remained the more these forms of town life perished , until finally all was merged into one confused , lifeless scene of plunder .
