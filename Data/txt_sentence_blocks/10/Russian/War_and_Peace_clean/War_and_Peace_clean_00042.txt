`` I say so , '' he continued desperately , `` because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy , and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it , and so for the general good , he could not stop short for the sake of one man 's life . '' 
`` Wo n't you come over to the other table ? '' 
suggested Anna Pavlovna . 
But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her . 
`` No , '' cried he , becoming more and more eager , `` Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution , suppressed its abuses , preserved all that was good in it -- equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press -- and only for that reason did he obtain power . '' 
`` Yes , if having obtained power , without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king , I should have called him a great man , '' remarked the vicomte . 
`` He could not do that . 
The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man . 
The Revolution was a grand thing ! '' 
continued Monsieur Pierre , betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind .
