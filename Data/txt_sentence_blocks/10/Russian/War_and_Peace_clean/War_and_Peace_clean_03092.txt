The baby again opened his eyes and looked at her . 
`` You 're here ? '' 
he seemed to be saying , and again lazily smacked his lips . 
Cautiously withdrawing her breast , Natasha rocked him a little , handed him to the nurse , and went with rapid steps toward the door . 
But at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon , and she glanced round . 
The nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot . 
`` Go , ma'am ! 
Do n't worry , go ! '' 
she whispered , smiling , with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress . 
Natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom .
