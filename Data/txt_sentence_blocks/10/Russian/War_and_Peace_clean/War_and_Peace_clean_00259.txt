`` I dreamed last night ... '' -- `` You were not expecting us ? 
... '' - `` Ah ! 
Mary , you have got thinner ? 
... '' `` And you have grown stouter ! 
... '' `` I knew the princess at once , '' put in Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` And I had no idea ! 
... '' exclaimed Princess Mary . 
`` Ah , Andrew , I did not see you . '' 
Prince Andrew and his sister , hand in hand , kissed one another , and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever . 
Princess Mary had turned toward her brother , and through her tears the loving , warm , gentle look of her large luminous eyes , very beautiful at that moment , rested on Prince Andrew 's face .
