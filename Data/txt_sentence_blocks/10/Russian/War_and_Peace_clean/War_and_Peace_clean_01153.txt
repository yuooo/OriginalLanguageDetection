`` I see I 'm intruding , '' Rostov repeated . 
The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris ' face : having evidently reflected and decided how to act , he very quietly took both Rostov 's hands and led him into the next room . 
His eyes , looking serenely and steadily at Rostov , seemed to be veiled by something , as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality . 
So it seemed to Rostov . 
`` Oh , come now ! 
As if you could come at a wrong time ! '' 
said Boris , and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests , explaining that he was not a civilian , but an hussar officer , and an old friend of his . 
`` Count Zhilinski -- le Comte N. N. -- le Capitaine S. S. , '' said he , naming his guests . 
Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen , bowed reluctantly , and remained silent . 
Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov .
