For history , lines exist of the movement of human wills , one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man 's will in the present moves in space , time , and dependence on cause . 
The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes , the more evident are the laws of that movement . 
To discover and define those laws is the problem of history . 
From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows , seeking the causes of events in man 's freewill , a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible , for however man 's free will may be restricted , as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law , the existence of law becomes impossible . 
Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal , that is , by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity , can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes , and then instead of seeking causes , history will take the discovery of laws as its problem . 
The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which -- ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena -- the old method of history is moving . 
All human sciences have traveled along that path . 
Arriving at infinitesimals , mathematics , the most exact of sciences , abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown , infinitely small , quantities . 
Abandoning the conception of cause , mathematics seeks law , that is , the property common to all unknown , infinitely small , elements . 
In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded .
