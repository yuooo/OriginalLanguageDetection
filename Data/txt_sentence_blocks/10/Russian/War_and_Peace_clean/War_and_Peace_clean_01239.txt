Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment , spending comparatively little , the way of life at Otradnoe -- Mitenka 's management of affairs , in particular -- was such that the debts inevitably increased every year . 
The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post , so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also , as he said , to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time . 
Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera and was accepted . 
Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought , yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one . 
In Petersburg they were provincials , and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged , here looked down on them . 
The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow , and the most diverse people met at their suppers . 
Country neighbors from Otradnoe , impoverished old squires and their daughters , Peronskaya a maid of honor , Pierre Bezukhov , and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg . 
Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostovs ' house in Petersburg were Boris , Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him , and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs ' and paid the eldest daughter , Countess Vera , the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose . 
Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left . 
He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed , and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz .
