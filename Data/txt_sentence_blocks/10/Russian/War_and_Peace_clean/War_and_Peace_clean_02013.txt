said Rostov laughing . 
`` Is there any hay here ? '' 
`` And how like one another , '' said Ilyin . 
`` A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa ... ! '' 
sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile . 
One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov . 
`` Who do you belong to ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The French , '' replied Ilyin jestingly , `` and here is Napoleon himself '' -- and he pointed to Lavrushka .
