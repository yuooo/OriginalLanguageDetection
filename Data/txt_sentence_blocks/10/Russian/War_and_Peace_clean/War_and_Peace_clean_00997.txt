`` Just as I may suppose you to be deluded , '' said Pierre , with a faint smile . 
`` I should never dare to say that I know the truth , '' said the Mason , whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness . 
`` No one can attain to truth by himself . 
Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all , by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times , is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God , '' he added , and closed his eyes . 
`` I ought to tell you that I do not believe ... do not believe in God , '' said Pierre , regretfully and with an effort , feeling it essential to speak the whole truth . 
The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he , poor man , had not the five rubles that would make him happy . 
`` Yes , you do not know Him , my dear sir , '' said the Mason . 
`` You can not know Him . 
You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I am unhappy , '' assented Pierre .
