thought Rostov . 
Five minutes later , Denisov came into the hut , climbed with muddy boots on the bed , lit his pipe , furiously scattered his things about , took his leaded whip , buckled on his saber , and went out again . 
In answer to Rostov 's inquiry where he was going , he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business . 
`` Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards ! '' 
said Denisov going out , and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud . 
He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone . 
Having got warm in his corner , he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening . 
Denisov had not yet returned . 
The weather had cleared up , and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka , laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud . 
Rostov joined them .
