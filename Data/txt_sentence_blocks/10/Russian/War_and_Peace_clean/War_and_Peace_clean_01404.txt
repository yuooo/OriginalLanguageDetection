At midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees . 
Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips . 
Facing him lay a field of winter rye , there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush . 
The hounds had scarcely been loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew , Voltorn , giving tongue at intervals ; other hounds joined in , now pausing and now again giving tongue . 
A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found , and the whole pack , joining together , rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas . 
He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine , he even saw the hounds , and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite . 
The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois , and Nicholas saw a queer , short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field . 
The borzois bore down on it ... . 
Now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves , trailing its brush , when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one , and everything was in confusion ; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure , scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group . 
Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs ; one in a red cap , the other , a stranger , in a green coat .
