On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious action for the first time . 
On the twelfth of July , on the eve of that action , there was a heavy storm of rain and hail . 
In general , the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms . 
The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye , which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses . 
The rain was descending in torrents , and Rostov , with a young officer named Ilyin , his protege , was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter . 
An officer of their regiment , with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks , who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain , entered Rostov 's shelter . 
`` I have come from the staff , Count . 
Have you heard of Raevski 's exploit ? '' 
And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle , which he had heard at the staff . 
Rostov , smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck , listened inattentively , with an occasional glance at Ilyin , who was pressing close to him .
