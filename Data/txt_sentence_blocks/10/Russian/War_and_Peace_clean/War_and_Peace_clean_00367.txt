There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented . 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin 's horse at the porch . 
In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine . 
`` Ah , you 've come here too , young man ! '' 
he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows . 
`` Yes , '' said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word ; and he sat down at the nearest table . 
Both were silent . 
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room . 
No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant . 
When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and , drawing its rings aside with his small , white , turned-up fingers , drew out a gold imperial , and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter .
