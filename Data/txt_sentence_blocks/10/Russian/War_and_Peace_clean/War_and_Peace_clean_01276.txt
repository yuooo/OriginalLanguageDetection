He pushed through , evidently looking for someone . 
Natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre , `` the buffoon , '' as Peronskaya had called him , and knew he was looking for them , and for her in particular . 
He had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her . 
But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome , dark man of middle height , and in a white uniform , who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon . 
Natasha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform : it was Bolkonski , who seemed to her to have grown much younger , happier , and better-looking . 
`` There 's someone else we know -- Bolkonski , do you see , Mamma ? '' 
said Natasha , pointing out Prince Andrew . 
`` You remember , he stayed a night with us at Otradnoe . '' 
`` Oh , you know him ? '' 
said Peronskaya .
