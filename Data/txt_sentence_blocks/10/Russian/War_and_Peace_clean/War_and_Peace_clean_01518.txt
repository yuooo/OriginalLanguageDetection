At first she heard only Metivier 's voice , then her father 's , then both voices began speaking at the same time , the door was flung open , and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Metivier with his shock of black hair , and the prince in his dressing gown and fez , his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards . 
`` You do n't understand ? '' 
shouted the prince , `` but I do ! 
French spy , slave of Buonaparte , spy , get out of my house ! 
Be off , I tell you ... '' Metivier , shrugging his shoulders , went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room . 
`` The prince is not very well : bile and rush of blood to the head . 
Keep calm , I will call again tomorrow , '' said Metivier ; and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away . 
Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry : `` Spies , traitors , traitors everywhere ! 
Not a moment 's peace in my own house ! '' 
After Metivier 's departure the old prince called his daughter in , and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her .
