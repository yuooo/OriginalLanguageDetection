The horses began to lather and the men to flush . 
`` Halt ! 
Dress your ranks ! '' 
the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead . 
`` Forward by the left . 
Walk , march ! '' 
came the order from in front . 
And the hussars , passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position , halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line . 
To the right stood our infantry in a dense column : they were the reserve . 
Higher up the hill , on the very horizon , our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air , brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams .
