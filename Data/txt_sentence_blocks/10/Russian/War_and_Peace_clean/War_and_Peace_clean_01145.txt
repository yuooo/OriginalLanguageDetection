He did not ask about the regiment , nor about the general state of affairs , and when Rostov spoke of these matters did not listen . 
Rostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment , or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital . 
He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers . 
On Rostov 's inquiry as to how the matter stood , he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it . 
He became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew Rostov 's attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies . 
His hospital companions , who had gathered round Rostov -- a fresh arrival from the world outside - gradually began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading his answer . 
Rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it . 
Only the man who had the next bed , a stout Uhlan , continued to sit on his bed , gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe , and little one-armed Tushin still listened , shaking his head disapprovingly . 
In the middle of the reading , the Uhlan interrupted Denisov . 
`` But what I say is , '' he said , turning to Rostov , `` it would be best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon .
