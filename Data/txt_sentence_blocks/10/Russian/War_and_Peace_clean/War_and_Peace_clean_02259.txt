How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold ? 
The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers -LRB- who too reason -RRB- also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight , fully convinced as they were of defeat . 
If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it , the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue . 
This Kutuzov knew well . 
Bennigsen , who had chosen the position , warmly displayed his Russian patriotism -LRB- Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing -RRB- by insisting that Moscow must be defended . 
His aim was as clear as daylight to Kutuzov : if the defense failed , to throw the blame on Kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle ; if it succeeded , to claim the success as his own ; or if battle were not given , to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow . 
But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man 's mind . 
One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone . 
The question for him now was : `` Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow , and when did I do so ? 
When was it decided ?
