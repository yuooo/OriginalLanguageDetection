`` Very , very glad to have seen you , '' repeated he , embracing Prince Vasili . 
`` My vocation is a different one , '' thought Princess Mary . 
`` My vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness , the happiness of love and self-sacrifice . 
And cost what it may , I will arrange poor Amelie 's happiness , she loves him so passionately , and so passionately repents . 
I will do all I can to arrange the match between them . 
If he is not rich I will give her the means ; I will ask my father and Andrew . 
I shall be so happy when she is his wife . 
She is so unfortunate , a stranger , alone , helpless ! 
And , oh God , how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself ! 
Perhaps I might have done the same !
