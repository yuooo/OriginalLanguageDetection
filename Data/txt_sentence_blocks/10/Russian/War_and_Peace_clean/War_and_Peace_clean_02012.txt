On the way to Bogucharovo , a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls , they questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories , and raced one another to try Ilyin 's horse . 
Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister . 
Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching Bogucharovo , and Rostov , outstripping Ilyin , was the first to gallop into the village street . 
`` You 're first ! '' 
cried Ilyin , flushed . 
`` Yes , always first both on the grassland and here , '' answered Rostov , stroking his heated Donets horse . 
`` And I 'd have won on my Frenchy , your excellency , '' said Lavrushka from behind , alluding to his shabby cart horse , `` only I did n't wish to mortify you . '' 
They rode at a footpace to the barn , where a large crowd of peasants was standing . 
Some of the men bared their heads , others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps . 
Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern , smiling , staggering , and singing some incoherent song , and approached the officers .
