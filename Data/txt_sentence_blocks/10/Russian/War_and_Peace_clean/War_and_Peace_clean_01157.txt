Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that , when the latter looked in after supper , he pretended to be asleep , and early next morning went away , avoiding Boris . 
In his civilian clothes and a round hat , he wandered about the town , staring at the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were staying . 
In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner ; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets , with hugh monograms A and N . 
In the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed . 
`` Boris does n't want to help me and I do n't want to ask him . 
That 's settled , '' thought Nicholas . 
`` All is over between us , but I wo n't leave here without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor . 
The Emperor ! 
... He is here ! '' 
thought Rostov , who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged .
