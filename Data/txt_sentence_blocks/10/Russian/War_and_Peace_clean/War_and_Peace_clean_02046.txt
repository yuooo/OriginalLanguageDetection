Denisov blushed like a girl -LRB- it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy , bibulous , time-worn face -RRB- and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy 's lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma . 
Denisov came from those parts and knew the country well . 
His plan seemed decidedly a good one , especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke . 
Kutuzov looked down at his own legs , occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it . 
And from that hut , while Denisov was speaking , a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear . 
`` What ? '' 
said Kutuzov , in the midst of Denisov 's explanations , `` are you ready so soon ? '' 
`` Ready , your Serene Highness , '' replied the general . 
Kutuzov swayed his head , as much as to say : `` How is one man to deal with it all ? '' 
and again listened to Denisov .
