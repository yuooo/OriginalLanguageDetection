`` The matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head . 
When the times comes to set to work I shall do it as no one else could , but now I can jest , and the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be , and the more amazed at my genius . '' 
Having finished his second glass of punch , Napoleon went to rest before the serious business which , he considered , awaited him next day . 
He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep , and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening , he went into the large division of the tent at three o'clock in the morning , loudly blowing his nose . 
He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn , and was told that the enemy 's fires were still in the same places . 
He nodded approval . 
The adjutant in attendance came into the tent . 
`` Well , Rapp , do you think we shall do good business today ? '' 
Napoleon asked him . 
`` Without doubt , sire , '' replied Rapp .
