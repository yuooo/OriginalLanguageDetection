The only thought in his mind at that time was : who was it that had really sentenced him to death ? 
Not the men on the commission that had first examined him -- not one of them wished to or , evidently , could have done it . 
It was not Davout , who had looked at him in so human a way . 
In another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong , but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him . 
The adjutant , also , had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in . 
Then who was executing him , killing him , depriving him of life -- him , Pierre , with all his memories , aspirations , hopes , and thoughts ? 
Who was doing this ? 
And Pierre felt that it was no one . 
It was a system -- a concurrence of circumstances . 
A system of some sort was killing him -- Pierre -- depriving him of life , of everything , annihilating him .
