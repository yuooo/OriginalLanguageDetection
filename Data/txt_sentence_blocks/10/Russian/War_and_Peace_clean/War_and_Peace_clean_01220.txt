At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to Petersburg from abroad . 
Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and , turning the conversation upon Pierre 's matrimonial affairs , by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent . 
At the same time his mother-in-law , Prince Vasili 's wife , sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter . 
Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife , and in the mood he then was , this was not even unpleasant to him . 
Nothing mattered to him . 
Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance , and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife . 
`` No one is right and no one is to blame ; so she too is not to blame , '' he thought . 
If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife , it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step . 
Had his wife come to him , he would not have turned her away . 
Compared to what preoccupied him , was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not ?
