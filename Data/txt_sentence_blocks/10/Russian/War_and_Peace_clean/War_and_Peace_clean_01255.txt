I had a cousin ... '' `` I know ! 
Cyril Matveich ... but he is old . '' 
`` He was not always old . 
But this is what I 'll do , Natasha , I 'll have a talk with Boris . 
He need not come so often ... '' `` Why not , if he likes to ? '' 
`` Because I know it will end in nothing ... '' `` How can you know ? 
No , Mamma , do n't speak to him ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
said Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property .
