And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics , geography , political economy , comparative philology , and geology , which directly contradict its assumptions . 
The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy . 
Theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation . 
But when truth conquered , theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation . 
Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history , and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view , and accuses the new view of subverting revelation . 
In the one case as in the other , on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth . 
On the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages , on the other is the passion for destruction . 
To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy , it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in God , in the creation of the firmament , and in the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun . 
To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton , to Voltaire for example , it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion , and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion . 
Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability , to destroy the conception of the soul , of good and evil , and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions .
