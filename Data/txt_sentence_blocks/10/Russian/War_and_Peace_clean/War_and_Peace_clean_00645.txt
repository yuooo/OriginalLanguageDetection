Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne , they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance , up to the appearance of the pauvre mere ; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone . 
When Princess Mary went to her father 's room at the usual hour , Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory . 
Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation . 
It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day , but that they also knew what she thought about it . 
She read this in Tikhon 's face and in that of Prince Vasili 's valet , who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water . 
The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning . 
Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father 's . 
His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic , when rising from his chair he would walk away from her , repeating in a low voice the same words several times over . 
He came to the point at once , treating her ceremoniously . 
`` I have had a proposition made me concerning you , '' he said with an unnatural smile .
