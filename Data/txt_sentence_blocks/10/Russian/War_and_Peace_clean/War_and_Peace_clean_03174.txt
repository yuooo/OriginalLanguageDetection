`` If the animals leading the herd change , this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another , according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd . '' 
Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known . 
-LRB- With this method of observation it often happens that the observer , influenced by the direction he himself prefers , regards those as leaders who , owing to the people 's change of direction , are no longer in front , but on one side , or even in the rear . -RRB- 
`` If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered , this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention , and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd . '' 
So say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons , from monarchs to journalists , as the expression of their age . 
The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase -- a restatement of the question in other words . 
What causes historical events ? 
Power . 
What is power ? 
Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person .
