He walked in rapidly , bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over . 
The band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it , beginning : `` Alexander , Elisaveta , all our hearts you ravish quite ... '' The Emperor passed on to the drawing room , the crowd made a rush for the doors , and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again . 
Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing-room door , at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess . 
A young man , looking distraught , pounced down on the ladies , asking them to move aside . 
Some ladies , with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum , pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets . 
The men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise . 
Everyone moved back , and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music . 
The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina ; then came ambassadors , ministers , and various generals , whom Peronskaya diligently named . 
More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up , or preparing to take up , their positions for the polonaise .
