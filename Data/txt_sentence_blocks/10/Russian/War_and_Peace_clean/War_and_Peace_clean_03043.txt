All these acquaintances , who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him , now said , with a common feeling of self-reproach and emotion , as if justifying themselves : `` Well , whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man . 
You do n't meet such men nowadays ... . 
And which of us has not weaknesses of his own ? '' 
It was just when the count 's affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died . 
Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his father 's death reached him . 
He at once resigned his commission , and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to Moscow . 
The state of the count 's affairs became quite obvious a month after his death , surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected . 
The debts amounted to double the value of the property . 
Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance . 
But he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father 's memory , which he held sacred , and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts .
