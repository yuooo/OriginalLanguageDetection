On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode , who was in attendance on him , to the enemy camp . 
Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation , and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road . 
Bagration 's exhausted and hungry detachment , which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army , had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself . 
Kutuzov 's expectations that the proposals of capitulation -LRB- which were in no way binding -RRB- might give time for part of the transport to pass , and also that Murat 's mistake would very soon be discovered , proved correct . 
As soon as Bonaparte -LRB- who was at Schonbrunn , sixteen miles from Hollabrunn -RRB- received Murat 's dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation , he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat : Schonbrunn , 25th Brumaire , 1805 , at eight o'clock in the morning To PRINCE MURAT , I can not find words to express to you my displeasure . 
You command only my advance guard , and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order . 
You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign . 
Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy . 
Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so , and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right . 
If , however , the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention , I will ratify it ; but it is only a trick .
