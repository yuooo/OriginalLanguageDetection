And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy , and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe , the exhausted , wavering men felt comforted and inspirited . 
Prince Andrew 's regiment was among the reserves which till after one o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk , under heavy artillery fire . 
Toward two o'clock the regiment , having already lost more than two hundred men , was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery , where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense , concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o'clock . 
Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men . 
From in front and especially from the right , in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed , and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front , quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly . 
At times , as if to allow them a respite , a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead , but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off . 
With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed . 
The regiment stood in columns of battalion , three hundred paces apart , but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood . 
All alike were taciturn and morose . 
Talk was rarely heard in the ranks , and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of `` stretchers ! ''
