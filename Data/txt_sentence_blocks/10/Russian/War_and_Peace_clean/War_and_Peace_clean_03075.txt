Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat . 
And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door : `` Papa ! 
Mamma 's standing here ! '' 
Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy . 
He grew silent , and quiet ensued for a moment , terrible to Countess Mary . 
She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked . 
Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring , and his voice said crossly : `` I ca n't get a moment 's peace ... . 
Mary , is that you ? 
Why did you bring him here ? '' 
`` I only came in to look and did not notice ... forgive me ... '' Nicholas coughed and said no more .
