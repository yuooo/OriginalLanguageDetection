Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving , with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats . 
From the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms , stars , and ribbons , while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter , and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance . 
Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the crowd and caps were doffed . 
`` The Emperor ? 
... No , a minister ... . 
prince ... ambassador . 
Do n't you see the plumes ? 
... '' was whispered among the crowd . 
One person , better dressed than the rest , seemed to know everyone and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day . 
A third of the visitors had already arrived , but the Rostovs , who were to be present , were still hurrying to get dressed .
