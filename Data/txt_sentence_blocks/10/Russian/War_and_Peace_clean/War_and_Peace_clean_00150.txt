`` I am glad I have spoken out fully . 
Perhaps you did not like it ? 
You must excuse me , '' said he , putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him , `` but I hope I have not offended you . 
I always make it a rule to speak out ... Well , what answer am I to take ? 
Will you come to dinner at the Rostovs ' ? '' 
And Boris , having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it , became quite pleasant again . 
`` No , but I say , '' said Pierre , calming down , `` you are a wonderful fellow ! 
What you have just said is good , very good . 
Of course you do n't know me .
