We 'll have another dispute . 
Make friends with my little fool , Princess Mary , '' he shouted after Pierre , through the door . 
Only now , on his visit to Bald Hills , did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew . 
That charm was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and with the household . 
With the stern old prince and the gentle , timid Princess Mary , though he had scarcely known them , Pierre at once felt like an old friend . 
They were all fond of him already . 
Not only Princess Mary , who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims , gave him her most radiant looks , but even the one-year-old `` Prince Nicholas '' -LRB- as his grandfather called him -RRB- smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms , and Michael Ivanovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince . 
The old prince came in to supper ; this was evidently on Pierre 's account . 
And during the two days of the young man 's visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again . 
When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together , they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left , but as seldom happens , no one said anything but what was good of him .
