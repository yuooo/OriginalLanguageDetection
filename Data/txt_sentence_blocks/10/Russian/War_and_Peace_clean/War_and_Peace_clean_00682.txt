`` And you 're still the same diplomatist !

`` Well , as you see . 
So far everything 's all right , but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because when once a man starts on military service , he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible . '' 
`` Oh , that 's it ! ''
