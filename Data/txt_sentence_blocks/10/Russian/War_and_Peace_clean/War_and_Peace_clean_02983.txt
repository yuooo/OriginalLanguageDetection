`` How can you ask why ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` The thought alone of what awaits ... '' Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked inquiringly at Pierre . 
`` And because , '' Pierre continued , `` only one who believes that there is a God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and ... yours . '' 
Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped . 
Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary , asking about his friend 's last days . 
Pierre 's confusion had now almost vanished , but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone . 
He felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world . 
As he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on Natasha . 
He did not purposely say things to please her , but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint .
