`` Good night ! 
It is time for bed . '' 
Pierre rose and took his leave . 
Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom . 
They talked of what Pierre had told them . 
Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him . 
`` Well , good night , Mary ! '' 
said Natasha . 
`` Do you know , I am often afraid that by not speaking of him '' -LRB- she meant Prince Andrew -RRB- `` for fear of not doing justice to our feelings , we forget him . '' 
Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Natasha 's remark , but she did not express agreement in words .
