The men crowded together round the campfires . 
Pierre went up to the fire , ate some roast horseflesh , lay down with his back to the fire , and immediately fell asleep . 
He again slept as he had done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino . 
Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone , he or another , gave expression to his thoughts , and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk . 
`` Life is everything . 
Life is God . 
Everything changes and moves and that movement is God . 
And while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine . 
To love life is to love God . 
Harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in one 's sufferings , in innocent sufferings . ''
