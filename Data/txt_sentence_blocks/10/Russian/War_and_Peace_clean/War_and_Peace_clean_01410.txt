`` So in your parts , too , the harvest is nothing to boast of , Count ? '' 
he went on , continuing the conversation they had begun . 
And considering it polite to return the young count 's compliment , Ilagin looked at his borzois and picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her breadth . 
`` That black-spotted one of yours is fine -- well shaped ! '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , she 's fast enough , '' replied Nicholas , and thought : `` If only a full-grown hare would cross the field now I 'd show you what sort of borzoi she is , '' and turning to his groom , he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found a hare . 
`` I do n't understand , '' continued Ilagin , `` how some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and dogs . 
For myself , I can tell you , Count , I enjoy riding in company such as this ... what could be better ? '' 
-LRB- he again raised his cap to Natasha -RRB- `` but as for counting skins and what one takes , I do n't care about that . ''
