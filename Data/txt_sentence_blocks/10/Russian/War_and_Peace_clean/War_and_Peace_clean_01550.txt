she asked the count sternly . 
`` One thing has come on top of another : her rags to buy , and now a purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house . 
If you will be so kind , I 'll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day , and leave my lassies with you . '' 
`` All right . 
All right . 
They 'll be safe with me , as safe as in Chancery ! 
I 'll take them where they must go , scold them a bit , and pet them a bit , '' said Marya Dmitrievna , touching her goddaughter and favorite , Natasha , on the cheek with her large hand . 
Next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet , who was so afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her . 
Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau . 
When they got home she turned everybody out of the room except Nataisha , and then called her pet to her armchair .
