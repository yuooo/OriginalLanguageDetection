On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew , of their friendship , of his various meetings with him , and especially of the last one at Borodino . 
`` Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in ? 
Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died ? '' 
thought Pierre . 
He recalled Karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men , so different , and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them . 
Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood . 
The house had escaped the fire ; it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged . 
The old footman , who met Pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house , informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments , and that she received on Sundays . 
`` Announce me . 
Perhaps she will see me , '' said Pierre .
