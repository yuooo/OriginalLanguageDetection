If you please , could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop ... '' Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer . 
`` Eh , what twaddle ! '' 
said one of them , a thin , stern-looking man . 
`` When one 's head is gone one does n't weep for one 's hair ! 
Take what any of you like ! '' 
And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer . 
`` It 's all very well for you , Ivan Sidorych , to talk , '' said the first tradesman angrily . 
`` Please step inside , your honor ! '' 
`` Talk indeed ! '' 
cried the thin one .
