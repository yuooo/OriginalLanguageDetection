In the first case , if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself , that is , a mere form without content . 
In the second case , if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space , time , and cause , which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing , or mere content without form . 
We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man 's whole outlook on the universe is constructed -- the incomprehensible essence of life , and the laws defining that essence . 
Reason says : -LRB- 1 -RRB- space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite , and can not be imagined otherwise . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- Time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end . 
Consciousness says : -LRB- 1 -RRB- I alone am , and all that exists is but me , consequently I include space . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- I measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living , consequently I am outside time . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- I am beyond cause , for I feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life . 
Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability .
