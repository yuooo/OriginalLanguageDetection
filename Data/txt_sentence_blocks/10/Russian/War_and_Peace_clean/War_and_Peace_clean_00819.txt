His head was burning , he felt himself bleeding to death , and he saw above him the remote , lofty , and everlasting sky . 
He knew it was Napoleon -- his hero -- but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small , insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it . 
At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him , or what was said of him ; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life , which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently . 
He collected all his strength , to stir and utter a sound . 
He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak , sickly groan which aroused his own pity . 
`` Ah ! 
He is alive , '' said Napoleon . 
`` Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station . '' 
Having said this , Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes , who , hat in hand , rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory . 
Prince Andrew remembered nothing more : he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher , the jolting while being moved , and the probing of his wound at the dressing station .
