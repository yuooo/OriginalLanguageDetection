`` Too dear ! '' 
Natasha remarked . 
`` How pleased the children will be and Mamma too ! 
Only you need not have bought me this , '' she added , unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls , of a kind then just coming into fashion . 
`` Adele tempted me : she kept on telling me to buy it , '' returned Pierre . 
`` When am I to wear it ? '' 
and Natasha stuck it in her coil of hair . 
`` When I take little Masha into society ? 
Perhaps they will be fashionable again by then .
