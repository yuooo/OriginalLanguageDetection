he shouted , holding up his whip threateningly at the count . 
`` You 've let the wolf go ! 
... What sportsmen ! '' 
and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count , he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused and flew off after the hounds . 
The count , like a punished schoolboy , looked round , trying by a smile to win Simon 's sympathy for his plight . 
But Simon was no longer there . 
He was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides , all trying to head the wolf , but it vanished into the wood before they could do so . 
Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post , waiting for the wolf . 
By the way the hunt approached and receded , by the cries of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him , by the way the voices of the huntsmen approached , receded , and rose , he realized what was happening at the copse . 
He knew that young and old wolves were there , that the hounds had separated into two packs , that somewhere a wolf was being chased , and that something had gone wrong .
