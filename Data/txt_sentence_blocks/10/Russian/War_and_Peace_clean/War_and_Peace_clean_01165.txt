Beside himself with enthusiasm , Rostov ran after him with the crowd . 
The Emperor rode to the square where , facing one another , a battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left . 
As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions , which presented arms , another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank , and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon . 
It could be no one else . 
He came at a gallop , wearing a small hat , a blue uniform open over a white vest , and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder . 
He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth . 
On approaching Alexander he raised his hat , and as he did so , Rostov , with his cavalryman 's eye , could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle . 
The battalions shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
and `` Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
Napoleon said something to Alexander , and both Emperors dismounted and took each other 's hands .
