`` You 're not asleep ? '' 
Natasha jumped up , snatched up her slippers , and ran barefoot to her own room . 
It was a long time before she could sleep . 
She kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her . 
`` Sonya ? '' 
she thought , glancing at that curled-up , sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair . 
`` No , how could she ? 
She 's virtuous . 
She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more . 
Even Mamma does not understand .
