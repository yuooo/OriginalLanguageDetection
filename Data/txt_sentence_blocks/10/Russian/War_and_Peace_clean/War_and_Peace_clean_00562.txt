asked Bagration , frowning , not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing , among whom Zherkov laughed loudest . 
Only now , when he was confronted by the stern authorities , did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to Tushin in all their horror . 
He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment . 
The officers ' laughter confused him still more . 
He stood before Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter : `` I do n't know ... your excellency ... I had no men ... your excellency . '' 
`` You might have taken some from the covering troops . '' 
Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops , though that was perfectly true . 
He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble , and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner . 
The silence lasted some time . 
Prince Bagration , apparently not wishing to be severe , found nothing to say ; the others did not venture to intervene .
