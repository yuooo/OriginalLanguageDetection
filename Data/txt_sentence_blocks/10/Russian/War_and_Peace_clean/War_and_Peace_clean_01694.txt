Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of Rostova . 
He resolutely denied these rumors , assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused . 
It seemed to Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish Natasha 's reputation . 
He was awaiting Prince Andrew 's return with dread and went every day to the old prince 's for news of him . 
Old Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which Natasha had broken off her engagement . 
He seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience . 
Some days after Anatole 's departure Pierre received a note from Prince Andrew , informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him . 
As soon as he reached Moscow , Prince Andrew had received from his father Natasha 's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement -LRB- Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given it to the old prince -RRB- , and he heard from him the story of Natasha 's elopement , with additions . 
Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next morning . 
Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state as Natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg .
