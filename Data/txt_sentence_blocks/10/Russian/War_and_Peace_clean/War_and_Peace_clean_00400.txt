Beside the bridge Nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order , and having done this he rode back . 
Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge . 
Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground , eager to rejoin its fellows , he watched his squadron draw nearer . 
Then the clang of hoofs , as of several horses galloping , resounded on the planks of the bridge , and the squadron , officers in front and men four abreast , spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it . 
The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will , estrangement , and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean , smart hussars who moved past them in regular order . 
`` Smart lads ! 
Only fit for a fair ! '' 
said one . 
`` What good are they ? 
They 're led about just for show ! ''
