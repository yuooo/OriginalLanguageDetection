At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news : Napoleon 's seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg 's territory , and the Russian Note , hostile to Napoleon , which had been sent to all the European courts . 
`` Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel , '' said Count Rostopchin , repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before . 
`` One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads .

`` He shifts the Dukes about as I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan estates . '' 
`` The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation , '' remarked Boris , joining in respectfully . 
He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the Duke .
