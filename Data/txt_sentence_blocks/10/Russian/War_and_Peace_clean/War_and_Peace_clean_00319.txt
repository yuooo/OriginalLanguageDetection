said he , recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat . 
One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander , but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him , and so Kutuzov , who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good , quickly turned away , a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face . 
`` Another Ismail comrade , '' said he . 
`` A brave officer ! 
Are you satisfied with him ? '' 
he asked the regimental commander . 
And the latter -- unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass -- started , moved forward , and answered : `` Highly satisfied , your excellency ! '' 
`` We all have our weaknesses , '' said Kutuzov smiling and walking away from him . 
`` He used to have a predilection for Bacchus . '' 
The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer .
