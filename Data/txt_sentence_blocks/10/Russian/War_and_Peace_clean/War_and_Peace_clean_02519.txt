Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone . 
And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force . 
`` Yes -- love , '' he thought again quite clearly . 
`` But not love which loves for something , for some quality , for some purpose , or for some reason , but the love which I -- while dying -- first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him . 
I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object . 
Now again I feel that bliss . 
To love one 's neighbors , to love one 's enemies , to love everything , to love God in all His manifestations . 
It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love , but an enemy can only be loved by divine love . 
That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man .
