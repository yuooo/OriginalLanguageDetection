`` Permit me , Princess , to know what is necessary and what is not necessary , '' said the younger of the two speakers , evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room . 
`` But , my dear princess , '' answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but impressively , blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing , `` wo n't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose ? 
Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared ... '' Prince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude , with one leg crossed high above the other . 
His cheeks , which were so flabby that they looked heavier below , were twitching violently ; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying . 
`` Come , my dear Anna Mikhaylovna , let Catiche do as she pleases . 
You know how fond the count is of her . '' 
`` I do n't even know what is in this paper , '' said the younger of the two ladies , addressing Prince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand . 
`` All I know is that his real will is in his writing table , and this is a paper he has forgotten ... '' She tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna , but the latter sprang so as to bar her path . 
`` I know , my dear , kind princess , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna , seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily . 
`` Dear princess , I beg and implore you , have some pity on him !
