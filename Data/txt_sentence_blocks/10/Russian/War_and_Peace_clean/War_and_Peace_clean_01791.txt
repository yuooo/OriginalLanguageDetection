Believe me , directly the war is over , if I am still alive and still loved by you , I will throw up everything and fly to you , to press you forever to my ardent breast . '' 
It was , in fact , only the commencement of the campaign that prevented Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sonya . 
The autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting , and the winter with the Christmas holidays and Sonya 's love , had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before , and which now allured him . 
`` A splendid wife , children , a good pack of hounds , a dozen leashes of smart borzois , agriculture , neighbors , service by election ... '' thought he . 
But now the campaign was beginning , and he had to remain with his regiment . 
And since it had to be so , Nicholas Rostov , as was natural to him , felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life . 
On his return from his furlough Nicholas , having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades , was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders . 
During his absence he had been promoted captain , and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers , he was again allotted his old squadron . 
The campaign began , the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay , new officers arrived , new men and horses , and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war , and Rostov , conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment , devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service , though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them . 
The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of state , political and strategic .
