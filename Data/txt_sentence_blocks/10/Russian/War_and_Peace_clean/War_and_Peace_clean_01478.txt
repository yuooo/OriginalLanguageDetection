The clown -- Dimmler -- and the lady -- Nicholas -- started a dance . 
Surrounded by the screaming children the mummers , covering their faces and disguising their voices , bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room . 
`` Dear me ! 
there 's no recognizing them ! 
And Natasha ! 
See whom she looks like ! 
She really reminds me of somebody . 
But Herr Dimmler -- is n't he good ! 
I did n't know him ! 
And how he dances .
