He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management , disliked factories , the raising of expensive products , and the buying of expensive seed corn , and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate . 
He always had before his mind 's eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it . 
The chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil , nor the oxygen in the air , nor manures , nor special plows , but that most important agent by which nitrogen , oxygen , manure , and plow were made effective -- the peasant laborer . 
When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches , it was the serf who especially attracted his attention . 
The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool , but also a judge of farming and an end in himself . 
At first he watched the serfs , trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad , and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods , their manner of speech , and their judgment of what was good and bad . 
Only when he had understood the peasants ' tastes and aspirations , had learned to talk their language , to grasp the hidden meaning of their words , and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs , that is , to perform toward them the duties demanded of him . 
And Nicholas ' management produced very brilliant results . 
Guided by some gift of insight , on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff , village elder , and delegate , the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose , and these posts never changed hands . 
Before analyzing the properties of manure , before entering into the debit and credit -LRB- as he ironically called it -RRB- , he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means .
