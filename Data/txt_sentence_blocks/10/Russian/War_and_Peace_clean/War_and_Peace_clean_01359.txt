Under guise of a present for the pilgrims , Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim 's complete costume for herself : a coarse smock , bast shoes , a rough coat , and a black kerchief . 
Often , approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure , Princess Mary paused , uncertain whether the time had not already come to put her project into execution . 
Often , listening to the pilgrims ' tales , she was so stimulated by their simple speech , mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning , that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running away from home . 
In imagination she already pictured herself by Theodosia 's side , dressed in coarse rags , walking with a staff , a wallet on her back , along the dusty road , directing her wanderings from one saint 's shrine to another , free from envy , earthly love , or desire , and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing , but eternal joy and bliss . 
`` I shall come to a place and pray there , and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it , I shall go farther . 
I will go on till my legs fail , and I 'll lie down and die somewhere , and shall at last reach that eternal , quiet haven , where there is neither sorrow nor sighing ... '' thought Princess Mary . 
But afterwards , when she saw her father and especially little Koko -LRB- Nicholas -RRB- , her resolve weakened . 
She wept quietly , and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God . 
The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor -- idleness -- was a condition of the first man 's blessedness before the Fall . 
Fallen man has retained a love of idleness , but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows , but because our moral nature is such that we can not be both idle and at ease .
