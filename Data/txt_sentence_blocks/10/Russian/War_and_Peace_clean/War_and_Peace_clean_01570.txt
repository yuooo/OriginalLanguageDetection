`` She 's a woman one could easily fall in love with . '' 
Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick . 
Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls , and the curtain rose . 
As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent , and all the men , old and young , in uniform and evening dress , and all the women with gems on their bare flesh , turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage . 
Natasha too began to look at it . 
The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards , at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees , and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards . 
In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts . 
One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench , to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued . 
They all sang something . 
When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter 's box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs , and holding a plume and a dagger , went up to her and began singing , waving his arms about .
