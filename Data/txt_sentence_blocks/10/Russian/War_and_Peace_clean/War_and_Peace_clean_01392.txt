The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses ' feet at the wolf . 
The wolf paused , turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly , like a man suffering from the quinsy , and , still slightly swaying from side to side , gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood . 
At the same instant , with a cry like a wail , first one hound , then another , and then another , sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared . 
The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel 's chestnut horse appeared , dark with sweat . 
On its long back sat Daniel , hunched forward , capless , his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed , perspiring face . 
`` Ulyulyulyu ! 
ulyulyu ! 
... '' he cried . 
When he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning . 
`` Blast you ! ''
