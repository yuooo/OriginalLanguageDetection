Without going home , Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow commander in chief . 
Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at Sokolniki . 
The anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders . 
Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered . 
Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants , the officials -- the heads of the various government departments -- knew that Moscow would soon be in the enemy 's hands , just as Count Rostopchin himself knew it , and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments . 
As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of Rostopchin 's private room . 
In answer to questions with which he was greeted , the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room . 
While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials , old and young , military and civilian , who were there . 
They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy . 
Pierre went up to a group of men , one of whom he knew .
