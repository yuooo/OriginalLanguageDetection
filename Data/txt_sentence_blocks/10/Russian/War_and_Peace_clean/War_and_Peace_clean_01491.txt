asked Natasha , suddenly beaming all over with joy . 
`` Oh , how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows ! 
... Natasha -- are you glad ? '' 
`` I am so glad , so glad ! 
I was beginning to be vexed with you . 
I did not tell you , but you have been treating her badly . 
What a heart she has , Nicholas ! 
I am horrid sometimes , but I was ashamed to be happy while Sonya was not , '' continued Natasha . 
`` Now I am so glad ! 
Well , run back to her . ''
