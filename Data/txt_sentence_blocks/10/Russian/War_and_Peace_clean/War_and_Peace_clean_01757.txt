To have one 's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court . 
`` Well , adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander , why do n't you say anything ? '' 
said he , as if it was ridiculous , in his presence , to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself , Napoleon . 
`` Are the horses ready for the general ? '' 
he added , with a slight inclination of his head in reply to Balashev 's bow . 
`` Let him have mine , he has a long way to go ! ''
