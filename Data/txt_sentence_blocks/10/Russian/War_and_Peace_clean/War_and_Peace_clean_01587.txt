What was that terror I felt of him ? 
What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now ? '' 
she thought . 
Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all she was feeling . 
She knew that Sonya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession . 
So Natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself . 
`` Am I spoiled for Andrew 's love or not ? '' 
she asked herself , and with soothing irony replied : `` What a fool I am to ask that ! 
What did happen to me ? 
Nothing !
