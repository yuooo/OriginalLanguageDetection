On reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the city . 
Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track . 
Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia . 
While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov , his former commander who was always well disposed toward him , and Kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia , to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief . 
So Prince Andrew , having received an appointment on the headquarters staff , left for Turkey . 
Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kuragin . 
He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to meet Kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel . 
But he again failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey , for soon after Prince Andrew arrived , the latter returned to Russia . 
In a new country , amid new conditions , Prince Andrew found life easier to bear . 
After his betrothed had broken faith with him -- which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects -- the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him , and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so .
