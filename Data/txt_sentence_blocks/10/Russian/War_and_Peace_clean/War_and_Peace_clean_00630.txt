`` Is it for visitors you 've got yourself up like that , eh ? '' 
said he . 
`` Fine , very fine ! 
You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors , and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent . '' 
`` It was my fault , mon pere , '' interceded the little princess , with a blush . 
`` You must do as you please , '' said Prince Bolkonski , bowing to his daughter-in-law , `` but she need not make a fool of herself , she 's plain enough as it is . '' 
And he sat down again , paying no more attention to his daughter , who was reduced to tears . 
`` On the contrary , that coiffure suits the princess very well , '' said Prince Vasili . 
`` Now you , young prince , what 's your name ? '' 
said Prince Bolkonski , turning to Anatole , `` come here , let us talk and get acquainted . ''
