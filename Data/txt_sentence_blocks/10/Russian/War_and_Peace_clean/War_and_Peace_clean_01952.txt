Here besides the law of retrospection , which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur , the law of reciprocity comes in , confusing the whole matter . 
A good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening , but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect . 
He only notices the mistake to which he pays attention , because his opponent took advantage of it . 
How much more complex than this is the game of war , which occurs under certain limits of time , and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects , but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills ! 
After Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma , and then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche , but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till they reached Borodino , seventy miles from Moscow . 
From Vyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow . 
Moscou , la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire , la ville sacree des peuples d'Alexandre , Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de pagodes chinoises , * this Moscow gave Napoleon 's imagination no rest . 
On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards , his bodyguard , his pages , and aides-de-camp . 
Berthier , his chief of staff , dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry . 
Followed by Lelorgne d'Ideville , an interpreter , he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression .
