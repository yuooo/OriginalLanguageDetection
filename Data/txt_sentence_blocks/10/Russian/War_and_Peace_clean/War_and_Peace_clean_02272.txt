What right have you , monseigneur , to demand an account of my attachments and friendships ? 
He is a man who has been more than a father to me ! '' 
The prince was about to say something , but Helene interrupted him . 
`` Well , yes , '' said she , `` it may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father , but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him . 
I am not a man , that I should repay kindness with ingratitude ! 
Know , monseigneur , that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I render account only to God and to my conscience , '' she concluded , laying her hand on her beautiful , fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven . 
`` But for heaven 's sake listen to me ! '' 
`` Marry me , and I will be your slave ! '' 
`` But that 's impossible . '' 
`` You wo n't deign to demean yourself by marrying me , you ... '' said Helene , beginning to cry .
