`` Lise , I beg you to desist , '' said Prince Andrew still more emphatically . 
Pierre , who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this , rose and approached the princess . 
He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself . 
`` Calm yourself , Princess ! 
It seems so to you because ... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No , excuse me ! 
An outsider is out of place here ... No , do n't distress yourself ... Good-by ! '' 
Prince Andrew caught him by the hand . 
`` No , wait , Pierre ! 
The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you . '' 
`` No , he thinks only of himself , '' muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears .
