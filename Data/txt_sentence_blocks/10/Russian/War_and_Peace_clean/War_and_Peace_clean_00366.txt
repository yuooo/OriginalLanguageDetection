So that if it is not so , then ... '' He could not finish , and ran out of the room . 
`` Ah , may the devil take you and evewybody , '' were the last words Rostov heard . 
Rostov went to Telyanin 's quarters . 
`` The master is not in , he 's gone to headquarters , '' said Telyanin 's orderly . 
`` Has something happened ? '' 
he added , surprised at the cadet 's troubled face . 
`` No , nothing . '' 
`` You 've only just missed him , '' said the orderly . 
The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck , and Rostov , without returning home , took a horse and rode there .
