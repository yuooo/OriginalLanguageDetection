`` What a darling Uncle is ! '' 
said Natasha , when they had come out onto the highroad . 
`` Yes , '' returned Nicholas . 
`` You 're not cold ? '' 
`` No . 
I 'm quite , quite all right . 
I feel so comfortable ! '' 
answered Natasha , almost perplexed by her feelings . 
They remained silent a long while . 
The night was dark and damp .
