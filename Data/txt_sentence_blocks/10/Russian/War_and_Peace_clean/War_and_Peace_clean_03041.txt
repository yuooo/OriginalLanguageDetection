A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter , and sees in this the purpose of the bee 's existence . 
Another , observing the migration of plants , notices that the bee helps in this work , and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee . 
But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first , the second , or any of the processes the human mind can discern . 
The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes , the more obvious it becomes , that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension . 
All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life . 
And so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations . 
Natasha 's wedding to Bezukhov , which took place in 1813 , was the last happy event in the family of the old Rostovs . 
Count Ilya Rostov died that same year and , as always happens , after the father 's death the family group broke up . 
The events of the previous year : the burning of Moscow and the flight from it , the death of Prince Andrew , Natasha 's despair , Petya 's death , and the old countess ' grief fell blow after blow on the old count 's head . 
He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events , and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him .
