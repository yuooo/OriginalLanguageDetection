`` There will be many toasts , it 's time to begin , '' he whispered , and taking up his glass , he rose . 
All were silent , waiting for what he would say . 
`` To the health of our Sovereign , the Emperor ! '' 
he cried , and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm . 
The band immediately struck up `` Conquest 's joyful thunder waken ... '' All rose and cried `` Hurrah ! '' 
Bagration also rose and shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon Grabern . 
Young Rostov 's ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred others .
