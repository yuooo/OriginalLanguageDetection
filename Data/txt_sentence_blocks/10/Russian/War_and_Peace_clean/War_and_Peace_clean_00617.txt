`` No , leave me alone , '' said Princess Mary . 
Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once . 
They looked at the beautiful , large , thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts , gazing shiningly and imploringly at them , and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist . 
`` At least , change your coiffure , '' said the little princess . 
`` Did n't I tell you , '' she went on , turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne , `` Mary 's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least . 
Not in the least ! 
Please change it . '' 
`` Leave me alone , please leave me alone ! 
It is all quite the same to me , '' answered a voice struggling with tears . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain , worse than usual , but it was too late .
