Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself - quite the contrary perhaps . 
But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner . 
Yet his creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel , and he had hardly got into it , when he suddenly stopped short . 
He remembered his own words at the elder 's : `` I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all , and that they all take me for a buffoon ; so I say let me play the buffoon , for you are , every one of you , stupider and lower than I. '' He longed to revenge himself on everyone for his own unseemliness . 
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked , `` Why do you hate so and so , so much ? '' 
And he had answered them , with his shameless impudence , `` I 'll tell you . 
He has done me no harm . 
But I played him a dirty trick , and ever since I have hated him . '' 
Remembering that now , he smiled quietly and malignantly , hesitating for a moment . 
His eyes gleamed , and his lips positively quivered .
