Oh , I fully share the court 's and the prosecutor 's conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever , that his statement may really be a desperate effort , planned in delirium , to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man . 
But again Smerdyakov 's name is pronounced , again there is a suggestion of mystery . 
There is something unexplained , incomplete . 
And perhaps it may one day be explained . 
But we wo n't go into that now . 
Of that later . 
`` The court has resolved to go on with the trial , but , meantime , I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor . 
But while I admire his talent I can not agree with him . 
I have visited Smerdyakov , I have seen him and talked to him , and he made a very different impression on me . 
He was weak in health , it is true ; but in character , in spirit , he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be .
