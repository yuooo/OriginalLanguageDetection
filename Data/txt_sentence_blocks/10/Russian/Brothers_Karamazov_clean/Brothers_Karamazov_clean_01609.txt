At the time fixed , Kolya lay down between the rails . 
The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment , their hearts beating with suspense , which was followed by alarm and remorse . 
At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station . 
Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness ; the monster roared as it approached . 
`` Run , run away from the rails , '' the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes , breathless with terror . 
But it was too late : the train darted up and flew past . 
The boys rushed to Kolya . 
He lay without moving . 
They began pulling at him , lifting him up . 
He suddenly got up and walked away without a word .
