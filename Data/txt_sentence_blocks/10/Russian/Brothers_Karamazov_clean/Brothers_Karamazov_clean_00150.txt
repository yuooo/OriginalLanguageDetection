This is so even now , of course , strictly speaking , but it is not clearly enunciated , and very , very often the criminal of to-day compromises with his conscience : ' I steal , ' he says , ` but I do n't go against the Church . 
I 'm not an enemy of Christ . ' 
That 's what the criminal of to-day is continually saying to himself , but when the Church takes the place of the State it will be difficult for him , in opposition to the Church all over the world , to say : ` All men are mistaken , all in error , all mankind are the false Church . 
I , a thief and murderer , am the only true Christian Church . ' 
It will be very difficult to say this to himself ; it requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances . 
Now , on the other side , take the Church 's own view of crime : is it not bound to renounce the present almost pagan attitude , and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation of society , as at present , into completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man , of his reformation and salvation ?
