He bowed to his guests in silence . 
But this time they approached to receive his blessing . 
Miusov even tried to kiss his hand , but the Father Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute . 
But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner , kissing his hand as peasants do . 
`` We must apologise most humbly , your reverence , '' began Miusov , simpering affably , and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone . 
`` Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited , Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
He felt obliged to decline the honour of your hospitality , and not without reason . 
In the reverend Father Zossima 's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his son , and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ... in fact , quite unseemly ... as '' - he glanced at the monks - `` your reverence is , no doubt , already aware . 
And therefore , recognising that he had been to blame , he felt sincere regret and shame , and begged me , and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch , to convey to you his apologies and regrets . 
In brief , he hopes and desires to make amends later .
