And do you suppose he 's going to give me money to help to bring that about when he 's crazy about her himself ? 
And that 's not all , either . 
I can tell you more than that . 
I know that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank , changed into notes of a hundred roubles . 
packed into a large envelope , sealed with five seals , and tied across with red tape . 
You see how well I know all about it ! 
On the envelope is written : ` To my angel , Grushenka , when she will come to me . ' 
He scrawled it himself in silence and in secret , and no one knows that the money 's there except the valet , Smerdyakov , whom he trusts like himself . 
So now he has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days ; he hopes she 'll come for the money . 
He has sent her word of it , and she has sent him word that perhaps she 'll come .
