That was long ago , five years ago , and he has forgotten us , he has married . 
Now he is a widower , he has written , he is coming here , and , do you know , we 've loved him , none but him , all this time , and we 've loved him all our life ! 
He will come , and Grushenka will be happy again . 
For the last five years she 's been wretched . 
But who can reproach her , who can boast of her favour ? 
Only that bedridden old merchant , but he is more like her father , her friend , her protector . 
He found her then in despair , in agony , deserted by the man she loved . 
She was ready to drown herself then , but the old merchant saved her - saved her ! '' 
`` You defend me very kindly , dear young lady . 
You are in a great hurry about everything , '' Grushenka drawled again .
