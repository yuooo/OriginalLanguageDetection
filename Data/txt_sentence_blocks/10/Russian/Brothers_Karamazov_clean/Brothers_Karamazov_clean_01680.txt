`` And as soon as I saw you with a dog , I thought it was Zhutchka you were bringing . '' 
`` Wait a bit , Karamazov , perhaps we shall find it yet ; but this is Perezvon . 
I 'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more than the mastiff pup . 
Wait a bit , Karamazov , you will know something in a minute . 
But , I say , I am keeping you here ! '' 
Kolya cried suddenly . 
`` You 've no overcoat on in this bitter cold . 
You see what an egoist I am . 
Oh , we are all egoists , Karamazov ! ''
