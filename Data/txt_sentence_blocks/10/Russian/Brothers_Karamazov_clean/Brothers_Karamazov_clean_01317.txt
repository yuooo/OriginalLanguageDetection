`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . ' 
The banker throws the dice . 
Podvysotsky wins . 
` Take it , panie , ' says the banker , and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million . 
` Take it , panie , this is your gain . ' 
There was a million in the bank . '
