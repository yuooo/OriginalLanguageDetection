At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step , but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin . 
He looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him , so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute . 
Gradually he seemed to sink into brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to the grave . 
It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church , Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it . 
After the customary rites the grave-diggers lowered the coffin . 
Snegiryov with his flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him back . 
He did not seem to understand fully what was happening . 
When they began filling up the grave , he suddenly pointed anxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something , but no one could make out what he meant , and he stopped suddenly . 
Then he was reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited , snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces - and flinging the morsels on the grave . 
`` Come , fly down , birds , fly down , sparrows ! ''
