No , live , I am told , for there 'd be nothing without you . 
If everything in the universe were sensible , nothing would happen . 
There would be no events without you , and there must be events . 
So against the grain I serve to produce events and do what 's irrational because I am commanded to . 
For all their indisputable intelligence , men take this farce as something serious , and that is their tragedy . 
They suffer , of course ... but then they live , they live a real life , not a fantastic one , for suffering is life . 
Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it ? 
It would be transformed into an endless church service ; it would be holy , but tedious . 
But what about me ? 
I suffer , but still , I do n't live .
