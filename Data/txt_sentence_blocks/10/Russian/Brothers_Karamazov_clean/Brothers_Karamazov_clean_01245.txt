What does he mean by ` I 'm stepping aside , I 'm punishing myself ' ? 
It 'll come to nothing ! 
He 's shouted such phrases a thousand times , drunk , in the taverns . 
But now he 's not drunk . 
` Drunk in spirit ' - they 're fond of fine phrases , the villains . 
Am I his nurse ? 
He must have been fighting , his face was all over blood . 
With whom ? 
I shall find out at the Metropolis . 
And his handkerchief was soaked in blood ... .
