But he did weep ; I saw it . 
And now , alas ! 
... '' `` And I am weeping now , German , I am weeping now , too , you saintly man , '' Mitya cried suddenly . 
In any case the anecdote made a certain favourable impression on the public . 
But the chief sensation in Mitya 's favour was created by the evidence of Katerina Ivanovna , which I will describe directly . 
Indeed , when the witnesses a decharge , that is , called the defence , began giving evidence , fortune seemed all at once markedly more favourable to Mitya , and what was particularly striking , this was a surprise even to the counsel for the defence . 
But before Katerina Ivanovna was called , Alyosha was examined , and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive evidence against one important point made by the prosecution . 
Fortune Smiles on Mitya IT came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself . 
He was not required to take the oath , and I remember that both sides addressed him very gently and sympathetically . 
It was evident that his reputation for goodness had preceded him .
