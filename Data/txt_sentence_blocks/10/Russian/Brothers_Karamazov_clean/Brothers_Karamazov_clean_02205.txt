`` It was he killed his father , you will see that directly . 
He wrote to me how he would kill his father ! 
But the other one is ill , he is ill , he is delirious ! ''

The court usher took the document she held out to the President , and she , dropping into her chair , hiding her face in her hands , began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing , shaking all over , and stifling every sound for fear she should be ejected from the court . 
The document she had handed up was that letter Mitya had written at the Metropolis tavern , which Ivan had spoken of as a `` mathematical proof . '' 
Alas ! 
its mathematical conclusiveness was recognised , and had it not been for that letter , Mitya might have escaped his doom or , at least , that doom would have been less terrible . 
It was , I repeat , difficult to notice every detail .
