He drove away any other idea , in fact . 
But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose , a new , incidental , but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself . 
If she were to say to him : `` I 'm yours ; take me away , '' how could he take her away ? 
Where had he the means , the money to do it ? 
It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch , doles which had gone on without interruption for so many years , ceased . 
Grushenka had money , of course , but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride ; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself , at his own expense , not at hers . 
He could not conceive of taking her money , and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion . 
I wo n't enlarge on this fact or analyse it here , but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment . 
All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated . 
`` I 've been a scoundrel to one of them , and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly , '' was his feeling then , as he explained after : `` and when Grushenka knows , she wo n't care for such a scoundrel . ''
