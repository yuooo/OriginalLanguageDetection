Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of , but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes . 
This time he could say almost certainly that she would come ! 
The Russian Monk . 
Father Zossima and His Visitors WHEN with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder 's cell , he stood still almost astonished . 
Instead of a sick man at his last gasp , perhaps unconscious , as he had feared to find him , he saw him sitting up in his chair and , though weak and exhausted , his face was bright and cheerful , he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation . 
But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha 's arrival ; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier , waiting for him to wake , having received a most confident assurance from Father Paissy that `` the teacher would get up , and as he had himself promised in the morning , converse once more with those dear to his heart . '' 
This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father Paissy put implicit trust in . 
If he had seen him unconscious , if he had seen him breathe his last , and yet had his promise that he would rise up and say good-bye to him , he would not have believed perhaps even in death , but would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfil his promise . 
In the morning as he lay down to sleep , Father Zossima had told him positively : `` I shall not die without the delight of another conversation with you , beloved of my heart . 
I shall look once more on your dear face and pour out my heart to you once again . ''
