`` From what specially ? '' 
`` I suffer ... from lack of faith . '' 
`` Lack of faith in God ? '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I dare not even think of that . 
But the future life - it is such an enigma And no one , no one can solve it . 
Listen ! 
You are a healer , you are deeply versed in the human soul , and of course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely , but I assure you on my word of honour that I am not speaking lightly now . 
The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish , to terror . 
And I do n't know to whom to appeal , and have not dared to all my life .
