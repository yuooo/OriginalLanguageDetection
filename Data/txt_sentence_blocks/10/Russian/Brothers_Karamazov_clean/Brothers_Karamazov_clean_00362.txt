We may add that he not only believed in his honesty , but had , for some reason , a liking for him , although the young man looked as morosely at him as at everyone and was always silent . 
He rarely spoke . 
If it had occurred to anyone to wonder at the time what the young man was interested in , and what was in his mind , it would have been impossible to tell by looking at him . 
Yet he used sometimes to stop suddenly in the house , or even in the yard or street , and would stand still for ten minutes , lost in thought . 
A physiognomist studying his face would have said that there was no thought in it , no reflection , but only a sort of contemplation . 
There is a remarkable picture by the painter Kramskoy , called `` Contemplation . '' 
There is a forest in winter , and on a roadway through the forest , in absolute solitude , stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes . 
He stands , as it were , lost in thought . 
Yet he is not thinking ; he is `` contemplating . '' 
If anyone touched him he would start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered .
