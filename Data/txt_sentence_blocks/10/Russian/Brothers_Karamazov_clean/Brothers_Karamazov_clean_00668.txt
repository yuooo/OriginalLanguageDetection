`` No , Lise , it 's not contempt , '' Alyosha answered , as though he had prepared himself for the question . 
`` I was thinking of that on the way here . 
How can it be contempt when we are all like him , when we are all just the same as he is ? 
For you know we are just the same , no better . 
If we are better , we should have been just the same in his place ... . 
I do n't know about you , Lise , but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways , and his soul is not sordid ; on the contrary , full of fine feeling ... . 
No , Lise , I have no contempt for him . 
Do you know , Lise , my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for children , and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
dear , let us care for people as we would for the sick ! ''
