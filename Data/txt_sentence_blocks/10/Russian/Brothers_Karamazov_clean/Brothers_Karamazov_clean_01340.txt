`` I do n't want my two hundred , either , '' cried Mitya , `` I would n't take it for anything ! 
Let him keep it as a consolation . '' 
`` Bravo , Mitya ! 
You 're a trump , Mitya ! '' 
cried Grushenka , and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation . 
The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity , was making for the door , but he stopped short and said suddenly , addressing Grushenka : `` Pani , if you want to come with me , come . 
If not , good-bye . '' 
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door . 
This was a man of character : he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed , he still expected that she would marry him . 
Mitya slammed the door after him .
