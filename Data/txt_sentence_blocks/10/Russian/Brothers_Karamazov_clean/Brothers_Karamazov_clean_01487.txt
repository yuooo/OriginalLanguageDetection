He has the heart of a chicken . 
When he talked to me , he was always trembling for fear I should kill him , though I never raised my hand against him . 
He fell at my feet and blubbered ; he has kissed these very boots , literally , beseeching me ` not to frighten him . ' 
Do you hear ? 
` Not to frighten him . ' 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , I offered him money . 
He 's a puling chicken - sickly , epileptic , weak-minded - a child of eight could thrash him . 
He has no character worth talking about . 
It 's not Smerdyakov , gentlemen .
