Smurov picked it up and carried it after him . 
All the boys were crying , and Kolya and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all . 
Though Smurov , with the captain 's hat in his hand , was crying bitterly too , he managed , as he ran , to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the path , to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by . 
He missed them , of course , and went on crying as he ran . 
Half-way , Snegiryov suddenly stopped , stood still for half a minute , as though struck by something , and suddenly turning back to the church , ran towards the deserted grave . 
But the boys instantly overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides . 
Then he fell helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down , and struggling , sobbing , and wailing , he began crying out , `` Ilusha , old man , dear old man ! '' 
Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him get up , soothing and persuading him . 
`` Captain , give over , a brave man must show fortitude , '' muttered Kolya . 
`` You 'll spoil the flowers , '' said Alyosha , and mamma is expecting them , she is sitting crying because you would not give her any before .
