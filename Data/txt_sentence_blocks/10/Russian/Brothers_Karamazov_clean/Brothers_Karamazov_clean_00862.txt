`` You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya , '' broke suddenly from Ivan . 
Again , as the day before , the words seemed to drop of themselves , and he laughed , too , a peculiar , nervous laugh . 
He remembered it long after . 
`` It 's a true saying then , that ` it 's always worth while speaking to a clever man , ' '' answered Smerdyakov firmly , looking significantly at Ivan . 
The carriage rolled away . 
Nothing was clear in Ivan 's soul , but he looked eagerly around him at the fields , at the hills , at the trees , at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky . 
And all of a sudden he felt very happy . 
He tried to talk to the driver , and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him ; but a minute later he realised that he was not catching anything , and that he had not really even taken in the peasant 's answer . 
He was silent , and it was pleasant even so . 
The air was pure and cool , sky bright .
