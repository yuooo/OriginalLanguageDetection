`` Be silent ! 
Do n't quarrel ! 
I wo n't have any quarrelling ! '' 
cried Grushenka imperiously , and she stamped her foot on the floor . 
Her face glowed , her eyes were shining . 
The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent . 
Mitya was terribly alarmed . 
`` Panovie , forgive me ! 
It was my fault , I 'm sorry . 
Vrublevsky , panie Vrublevsky , I 'm sorry . ''
