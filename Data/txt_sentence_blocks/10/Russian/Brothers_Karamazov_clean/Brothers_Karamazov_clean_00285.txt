Never ! 
For I 'm a Karamazov . 
For when I do leap into the pit , I go headlong with my heels up , and am pleased to be falling in that degrading attitude , and pride myself upon it . 
And in the very depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise . 
Let me be accursed . 
Let me be vile and base , only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is shrouded . 
Though I may be following the devil , I am Thy son , O Lord , and I love Thee , and I feel the joy without which the world can not stand . 
Joy everlasting fostereth The soul of all creation , It is her secret ferment fires The cup of life with flame . 
'T is at her beck the grass hath turned Each blade towards the light And solar systems have evolved From chaos and dark night , Filling the realms of boundless space Beyond the sage 's sight . 
At bounteous Nature 's kindly breast , All things that breathe drink Joy , And birds and beasts and creeping things All follow where She leads .
