If a man carries many such memories with him into life , he is safe to the end of his days , and if one has only one good memory left in one 's heart , even that may sometime be the means of saving us . 
Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on , may be unable to refrain from a bad action , may laugh at men 's tears and at those people who say as Kolya did just now , ' I want to suffer for all men , ' and may even jeer spitefully at such people . 
But however bad we may become - which God forbid - yet , when we recall how we buried Ilusha , how we loved him in his last days , and how we have been talking like friends all together , at this stone , the cruellest and most mocking of us - if we do become so will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at this moment ! 
What 's more , perhaps , that one memory may keep him from great evil and he will reflect and say , ` Yes , I was good and brave and honest then ! ' 
Let him laugh to himself , that 's no matter , a man often laughs at what 's good and kind . 
That 's only from thoughtlessness . 
But I assure you , boys , that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart , ` No , I do wrong to laugh , for that 's not a thing to laugh at . ' 
`` That will be so , I understand you , Karamazov ! '' 
cried Kolya , with flashing eyes . 
The boys were excited and they , too , wanted to say something , but they restrained themselves , looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker .
