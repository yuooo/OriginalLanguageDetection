When my business here is over and the verdict has been given , then I 'll tell you something . 
I 'll tell you everything . 
We 've something tremendous on hand ... . 
And you shall be my judge in it . 
But do n't begin about that now ; be silent . 
You talk of to-morrow , of the trial ; but , would you believe it , I know nothing about it . '' 
`` Have you talked to the counsel ? '' 
`` What 's the use of the counsel ? 
I told him all about it .
