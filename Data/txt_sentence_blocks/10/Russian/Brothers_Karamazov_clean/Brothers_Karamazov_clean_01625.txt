Ici , Perezvon . '' 
And Kolya began giving orders to the dog , who performed all his tricks . 
He was a rough-haired dog , of medium size , with a coat of a sort of lilac-grey colour . 
He was blind in his right eye , and his left ear was torn . 
He whined and jumped , stood and walked on his hind legs , lay on his back with his paws in the air , rigid as though he were dead . 
While this last performance was going on , the door opened and Agafya , Madame Krassotkin 's servant , a stout woman of forty , marked with small-pox , appeared in the doorway . 
She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand . 
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog . 
Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return , he did not cut short the performance , and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time , at last he whistled to him . 
The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty .
