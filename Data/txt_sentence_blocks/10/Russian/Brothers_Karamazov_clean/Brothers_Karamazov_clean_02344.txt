Gentlemen of the jury , if we convict and punish him , he will say to himself : ` These people have done nothing for my bringing up , for my education , nothing to improve my lot , nothing to make me better , nothing to make me a man . 
These people have not given me to eat and to drink , have not visited me in prison and nakedness , and here they have sent me to penal servitude . 
I am quits , I owe them nothing now , and owe no one anything for ever . 
They are wicked and I will be wicked . 
They are cruel and I will be cruel . ' 
That is what he will say , gentlemen of the jury . 
And I swear , by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for him : you will ease his conscience , he will curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it . 
At the same time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man , for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life . 
`` But do you want to punish him fearfully , terribly , with the most awful punishment that could be imagined , and at the same time to save him and regenerate his soul ? 
If so , overwhelm him with your mercy !
