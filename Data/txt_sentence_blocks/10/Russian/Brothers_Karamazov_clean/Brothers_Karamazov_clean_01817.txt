Altogether , I love young people , Alyosha , talented , modest , like you , and he has almost the mind of a statesman , he talks so charmingly , and I shall certainly , certainly try and get promotion for him . 
He is a future diplomat . 
On that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night . 
And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots , and always stretches them out on the carpet ... . 
He began hinting at his feelings , in fact , and one day , as he was going , he squeezed my hand terribly hard . 
My foot began to swell directly after he pressed my hand like that . 
He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before , and would you believe it , he is always gibing at him , growling at him , for some reason . 
I simply looked at the way they went on together and laughed inwardly . 
So I was sitting here alone - no , I was laid up then . 
Well , I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in , and only fancy !
