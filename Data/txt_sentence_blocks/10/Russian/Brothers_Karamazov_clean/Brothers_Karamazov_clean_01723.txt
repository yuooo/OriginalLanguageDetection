I say nothing against Dardanelov , he is a learned man , there 's no doubt about it . 
I respect men like that and it 's not because he stood up for me . '' 
`` But you took him down about the founders of Troy ! '' 
Smurov put in suddenly , proud of Krassotkin at such a moment . 
He was particularly pleased with the story of the goose . 
`` Did you really take him down ? '' 
the captain inquired , in a flattering way . 
`` On the question who founded Troy ? 
We heard of it , Ilusha told me about it at the time . '' 
`` He knows everything , father , he knows more than any of us ! ''
