And again he motioned at the notes . 
He was just going to get up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them , but , looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see them , he first took out his handkerchief , and as it turned out to be very dirty , took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table , and put it over the notes . 
The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian . 
Ivan read it mechanically . 
`` I wo n't have any lemonade , '' he said . 
`` Talk of me later . 
Sit down and tell me how you did it . 
Tell me all about it . '' 
`` You 'd better take off your greatcoat , or you 'll be too hot . '' 
Ivan , as though he 'd only just thought of it , took off his coat , and , without getting up from his chair , threw it on the bench .
