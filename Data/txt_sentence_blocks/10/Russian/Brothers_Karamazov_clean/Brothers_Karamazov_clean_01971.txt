From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him , so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him . 
Immediately after that meeting with him , Ivan had not gone home , but went straight to Smerdyakov again . 
The Second Visit to Smerdyakov BY that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital . 
Ivan knew his new lodging , the dilapidated little wooden house , divided in two by a passage , on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother , and on the other , Smerdyakov . 
No one knew on what terms he lived with them , whether as a friend or as a lodger . 
It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna 's betrothed , and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging . 
Both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly superior to themselves . 
Ivan knocked , and , on the door being opened , went straight into the passage . 
By Marya Kondratyevna 's directions he went straight to the better room on the left , occupied by Smerdyakov . 
There was a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot .
