`` Women are often dishonourable , '' she snarled . 
`` Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no , he is still a human being to me ! 
But did he do it ? 
Is he the murderer ? '' 
she cried , all of a sudden , hysterically , turning quickly to Ivan . 
Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before , perhaps only a moment before he came in , and not for the first time , but for the hundredth , and that they had ended by quarrelling . 
`` I 've been to see Smerdyakov ... . 
It was you , you who persuaded me that he murdered his father . 
It 's only you I believed '' she continued , still addressing Ivan . 
He gave her a sort of strained smile .
