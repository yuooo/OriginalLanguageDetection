`` But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action , I know that , and if only it is possible for him to come to you , or better still , to meet you in that same place , he will ask your forgiveness before everyone - if you wish it . '' 
`` After pulling out my beard , you mean , he will ask my forgiveness ? 
And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish , does n't he ? '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
On the contrary , he will do anything you like and in any way you like . '' 
`` So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in that very tavern - ` The Metropolis ' it 's called - or in the marketplace , he would do it ? '' 
`` Yes , he would even go down on his knees . '' 
`` You 've pierced me to the heart , sir . 
Touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart ! 
I am only too sensible of your brother 's generosity .
