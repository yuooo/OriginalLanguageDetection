He could not endure without mortification , without resentment even , that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior to him . 
Even had there been no miracles , had there been nothing marvellous to justify his hopes , why this indignity , why this humiliation , why this premature decay , `` in excess of nature , '' as the spiteful monks said ? 
Why this `` sign from heaven , '' which they so triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont , and why did they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it ? 
Where is the finger of Providence ? 
Why did Providence hide its face `` at the most critical moment '' -LRB- so Alyosha thought it -RRB- , as though voluntarily submitting to the blind , dumb , pitiless laws of nature ? 
That was why Alyosha 's heart was bleeding , and , of course , as I have said already , the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated ! 
This murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero , but I repeat again for the third time - and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my feeling - I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment , for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time , but , if love does not gain the upper hand in a boy 's heart at such an exceptional moment , when will it ? 
I will not , however , omit to mention something strange , which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha 's mind at this fatal and obscure moment . 
This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan , which now persistently haunted Alyosha 's mind . 
At this moment it haunted him .
