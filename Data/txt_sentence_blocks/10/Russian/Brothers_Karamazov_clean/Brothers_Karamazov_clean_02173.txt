I saw from his face he was n't lying . '' 
`` Only from his face ? 
Is that all the proof you have ? '' 
`` I have no other proof . '' 
`` And of Smerdyakov 's guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother 's word and the expression of his face ? '' 
`` No , I have no other proof . '' 
The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point . 
The impression left by Alyosha 's evidence on the public was most disappointing . 
There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial ; someone had heard something , someone had pointed out something else , it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his brother 's innocence and Smerdyakov 's guilt , and after all there was nothing , no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother . 
But Fetyukovitch began his cross-examination .
