Alyosha noticed this , smiled , and pressed his hand . 
`` I 've long learned to respect you as a rare person , '' Kolya muttered again , faltering and uncertain . 
`` I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery . 
I know you are a mystic , but ... that has n't put me off . 
Contact with real life will cure you ... . 
It 's always so with characters like yours . '' 
`` What do you mean by mystic ? 
Cure me of what ? '' 
Alyosha was rather astonished . 
`` Oh , God and all the rest of it . ''
