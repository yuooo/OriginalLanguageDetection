`` I 've heard of that officer , Grushenka 's former flame . 
Well , if he has turned up ... . 
Ech , those pistols ! 
Damn it all ! 
I 'm not his nurse ! 
Let them do what they like ! 
Besides , it 'll all come to nothing . 
They 're a set of brawlers , that 's all . 
They 'll drink and fight , fight and make friends again . 
They are not men who do anything real .
