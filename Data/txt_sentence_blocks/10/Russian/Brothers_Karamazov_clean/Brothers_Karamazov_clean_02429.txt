Well , and who has united us in this kind , good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember all our lives ? 
Who , if not Ilusha , the good boy , the dear boy , precious to us for ever ! 
Let us never forget him . 
May his memory live for ever in our hearts from this time forth ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , for ever , for ever ! '' 
the boys cried in their ringing voices , with softened faces . 
`` Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots , his coffin and his unhappy , sinful father , and how boldly he stood up for him alone against the whole school . '' 
`` We will remember , we will remember , '' cried the boys . 
`` He was brave , he was good ! '' 
`` Ah , how I loved him ! ''
