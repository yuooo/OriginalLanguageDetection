She had sold their little house , and was now living here with her mother . 
Smerdyakov , who was ill - almost dying-had been with them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch 's death . 
It was to him Ivan was going now , drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting . 
The First Interview with Smerdyakov THIS was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his return from Moscow . 
The first time he had seen him and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival , then he had visited him once more , a fortnight later . 
But his visits had ended with that second one , so that it was now over a month since he had seen him . 
And he had scarcely heard anything of him . 
Ivan had only returned five days after his father 's death , so that he was not present at the funeral , which took place the day before he came back . 
The cause of his delay was that Alyosha , not knowing his Moscow address , had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him , and she , not knowing his address either , telegraphed to her sister and aunt , reckoning on Ivan 's going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow . 
But he did not go to them till four days after his arrival .
