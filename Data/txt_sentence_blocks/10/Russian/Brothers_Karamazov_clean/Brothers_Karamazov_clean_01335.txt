cried the little Pole . 
`` I 'm - a knight , I 'm - a nobleman , and not a lajdak . 
I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman , perverse and shameless . '' 
`` Oh , go back where you came from ! 
I 'll tell them to turn you out and you 'll be turned out , '' cried Grushenka , furious . 
`` I 've been a fool , a fool , to have been miserable these five years ! 
And it was n't for his sake , it was my anger made me miserable . 
And this is n't he at all ! 
Was he like this ? 
It might be his father !
