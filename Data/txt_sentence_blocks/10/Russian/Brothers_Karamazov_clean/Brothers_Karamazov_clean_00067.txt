`` Now , I know myself , I am annoyed , I shall lose my temper and begin to quarrel - and lower myself and my ideas , '' he reflected . 
The Old Buffoon THEY entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in from his bedroom . 
There were already in the cell , awaiting the elder , two monks of the hermitage , one the Father Librarian , and the other Father Paissy , a very learned man , so they said , in delicate health , though not old . 
There was also a tall young man , who looked about two and twenty , standing in the corner throughout the interview . 
He had a broad , fresh face , and clever , observant , narrow brown eyes , and was wearing ordinary dress . 
He was a divinity student , living under the protection of the monastery . 
His expression was one of unquestioning , but self-respecting , reverence . 
Being in a subordinate and dependent position , and so not on an equality with the guests , he did not greet them with a bow . 
Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice , and by Alyosha . 
The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow , touching the ground with their fingers ; then kissed his hand .
