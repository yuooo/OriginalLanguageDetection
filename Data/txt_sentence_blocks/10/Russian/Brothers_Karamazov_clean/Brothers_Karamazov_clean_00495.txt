This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man . 
For monks are not a special sort of men , but only what all men ought to be . 
Only through that knowledge , our heart grows soft with infinite , universal , inexhaustible love . 
Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears ... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly . 
Be not afraid of your sins , even when perceiving them , if only there be penitence , but make no conditions with God . 
Again , I say , be not proud . 
Be proud neither to the little nor to the great . 
Hate not those who reject you , who insult you , who abuse and slander you . 
Hate not the atheists , the teachers of evil , the materialists - and I mean not only the good ones - for there are many good ones among them , especially in our day - hate not even the wicked ones . 
Remember them in your prayers thus : Save , O Lord , all those who have none to pray for them , save too all those who will not pray .
