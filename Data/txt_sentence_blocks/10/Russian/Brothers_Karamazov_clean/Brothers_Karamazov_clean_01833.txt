I sent for Lise directly . 
She laughed . 
` He thought you were asleep , ' she said , ` and came in to me to ask after your health . ' 
Of course , that 's how it happened . 
But Lise , Lise , mercy on us , how she distresses me ! 
Would you believe it , one night , four days ago , just after you saw her last time , and had gone away , she suddenly had a fit , screaming , shrieking , hysterics ! 
Why is it I never have hysterics ? 
Then , next day another fit , and the same thing on the third , and yesterday too , and then yesterday that aberration . 
She suddenly screamed out , ' I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch . 
I insist on your never letting him come to the house again . '
