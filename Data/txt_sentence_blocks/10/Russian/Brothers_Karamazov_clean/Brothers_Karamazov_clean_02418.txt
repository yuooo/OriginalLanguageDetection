It was an old and rather poor church ; many of the ikons were without settings ; but such churches are the best for praying in . 
During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer , though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious and , as it were , incoherent anxiety . 
At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath , when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it , then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity . 
After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha , who was standing beside him , that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant . 
During the prayer , `` Like the Cherubim , '' he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end . 
Falling on his knees , he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while . 
At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed . 
The distracted father began fussing about again , but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul . 
He seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid , short sobs , which he tried at first to smother , but at last he sobbed aloud . 
When they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin , he flung his arms about , as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha , and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips .
