`` Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee . '' 
`` Bravo , my darling ! 
He 'll have some coffee . 
Does it want warming ? 
No , it 's boiling . 
It 's capital coffee : Smerdyakov 's making . 
My Smerdyakov 's an artist at coffee and at fish patties , and at fish soup , too . 
You must come one day and have some fish soup . 
Let me know beforehand ... . 
But , stay ; did n't I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all ?
