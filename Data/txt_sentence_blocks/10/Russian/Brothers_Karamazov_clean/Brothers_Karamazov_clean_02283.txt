`` And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defence , '' Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding , `` whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities , remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice . 
Remember that you are the champions of our justice , the champions of our holy Russia , of her principles , her family , everything that she holds sacred ! 
Yes , you represent Russia here at this moment , and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will re-echo throughout the whole of Russia , and all Russia will hear you , as her champions and her judges , and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict . 
Do not disappoint Russia and her expectations . 
Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course . 
And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be , not from respect , as the poet would fain believe , but simply from horror . 
From horror , perhaps from disgust . 
And well it is that they stand aside , but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness , for the sake of their own safety , enlightenment and civilisation . 
Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe , they already begin to sound . 
Do not tempt them !
