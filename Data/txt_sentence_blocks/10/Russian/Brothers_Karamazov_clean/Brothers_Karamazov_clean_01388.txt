An expression of wonder , almost of alarm , came suddenly into her face . 
`` Mitya , who is that looking at us ? '' 
she whispered . 
Mitya turned , and saw that someone had , in fact , parted the curtains and seemed to be watching them . 
And not one person alone , it seemed . 
He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder . 
`` Here , come to us , come here , '' said a voice , speaking not loudly , but firmly and peremptorily . 
Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still . 
The room was filled with people , but not those who had been there before . 
An instantaneous shiver ran down his back , and he shuddered .
