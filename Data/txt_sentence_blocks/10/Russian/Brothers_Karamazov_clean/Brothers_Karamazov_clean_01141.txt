She was just then expecting the `` message , '' and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before . 
She hoped that `` please God he wo n't come till I 'm gone away , '' and he suddenly burst in on her . 
The rest we know already . 
To get him off her hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov 's , where she said she absolutely must go `` to settle his accounts , '' and when Mitya accompanied her at once , she said good-bye to him at the gate , making him promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her home again . 
Mitya , too , was delighted at this arrangement . 
If she was sitting at Samsonov 's she could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's , `` if only she 's not lying , '' he added at once . 
But he thought she was not lying from what he saw . 
He was that sort of jealous man who , in the absence of the beloved woman , at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to her , and how she may be betraying him , but , when shaken , heartbroken , convinced of her faithlessness , he runs back to her , at the first glance at her face , her gay , laughing , affectionate face , he revives at once , lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his jealousy . 
After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home . 
Oh , he had so much still to do that day !
