The whole court was thrown into confusion . 
I do n't remember everything as it happened . 
I was excited myself and could not follow . 
I only know that afterwards , when everything was quiet again and everyone understood what had happened , the court usher came in for a reprimand , though he very reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well , that the doctor had seen him an hour ago , when he had a slight attack of giddiness , but that , until he had come into the court , he had talked quite consecutively , so that nothing could have been foreseen - that he had , in fact , insisted on giving evidence . 
But before everyone had completely regained their composure and recovered from this scene , it was followed by another . 
Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics . 
She sobbed , shrieking loudly , but refused to leave the court , struggled , and besought them not to remove her . 
Suddenly she cried to the President : `` There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once ! 
Here is a document , a letter ... take it , read it quickly , quickly ! 
It 's a letter from that monster ... that man there , there ! ''
