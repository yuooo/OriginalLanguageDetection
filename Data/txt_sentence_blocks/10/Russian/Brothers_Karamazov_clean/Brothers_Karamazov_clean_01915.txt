`` And he told you on no account to tell me ? '' 
Alyosha asked again . 
`` To tell no one , and especially not you ; on no account to tell you . 
He is afraid , no doubt , that you 'll stand before me as my conscience . 
Do n't tell him I told you . 
Do n't tell him , for anything . '' 
`` You are right , '' Alyosha pronounced ; `` it 's impossible to decide anything before the trial is over . 
After the trial you 'll decide of yourself . 
Then you 'll find that new man in yourself and he will decide . '' 
`` A new man , or a Bernard who 'll decide a la Bernard , for I believe I 'm a contemptible Bernard myself , '' said Mitya , with a bitter grin .
