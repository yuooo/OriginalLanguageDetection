` Do n't frighten me ! ' 
she said . 
` Who told you so ? ' '' 
` Do n't be uneasy , ' I said , ' I wo n't tell anyone . 
You know I 'm as silent as the tomb . 
I only wanted , in view of `` possibilities , '' to add , that when they demand that 4500 roubles from your father , and he ca n't produce it , he 'll be tried , and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age , unless you like to send me your young lady secretly . 
I 've just had money paid me . 
I 'll give her four thousand , if you like , and keep the secret religiously . ' '' 
` Ah , you scoundrel ! '
