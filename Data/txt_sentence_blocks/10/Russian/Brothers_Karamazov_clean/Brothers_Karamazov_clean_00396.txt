`` You wo n't go . 
You want to keep an eye on me . 
That 's what you want , spiteful fellow . 
That 's why you wo n't go . '' 
The old man persisted . 
He had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert himself . 
`` Why are you looking at me ? 
Why do you look like that ? 
Your eyes look at me and say , ` You ugly drunkard ! ' 
Your eyes are mistrustful .
