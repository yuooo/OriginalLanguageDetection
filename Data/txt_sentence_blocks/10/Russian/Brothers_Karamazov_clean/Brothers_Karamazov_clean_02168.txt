I went away , and two days after I happened to be passing , and he shouted to me of himself , ` Uncle , Gott der Vater , Gott der Sohn , ' and he had only forgotten ` Gott der heilige Geist . ' 
But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for him again . 
But he was taken away , and I did not see him again . 
Twenty-three years passed . 
I am sitting one morning in my study , a white-haired old man , when there walks into the room a blooming young man , whom I should never have recognised , but he held up his finger and said , laughing , ` Gott der Vater , Gott der Sohn , and Gott der heilige Geist . 
I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts , for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts ; you are the only one that ever did . ' 
then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard , without boots on his feet , and my heart was touched and I said , ` You are a grateful young man , for you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you in your childhood . ' 
And I embraced him and blessed him . 
And I shed tears . 
He laughed , but he shed tears , too ... for the Russian often laughs when he ought to be weeping .
