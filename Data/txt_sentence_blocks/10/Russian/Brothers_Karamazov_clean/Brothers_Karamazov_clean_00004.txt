Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house , and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness . 
In the intervals he used to drive all over the province , complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaida Ivanovna 's having left him , going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life . 
What seemed to gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband , and to parade his woes with embellishments . 
`` One would think that you 'd got a promotion , Fyodor Pavlovitch , you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow , '' scoffers said to him . 
Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon , and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position . 
But , who knows , it may have been simplicity . 
At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife . 
The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg , where she had gone with her divinity student , and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about , making preparations to go to Petersburg , with what object he could not himself have said . 
He would perhaps have really gone ; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking .
