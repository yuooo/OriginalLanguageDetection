At first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns and in some other shady business , but now he has suddenly realised all she is and has gone wild about her . 
He keeps pestering her with his offers , not honourable ones , of course . 
And they 'll come into collision , the precious father and son , on that path ! 
But Grushenka favours neither of them , she 's still playing with them , and teasing them both , considering which she can get most out of . 
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he would n't marry her , and maybe he 'll turn stingy in the end , and keep his purse shut . 
That 's where Mitya 's value comes in ; he has no money , but he 's ready to marry her . 
Yes , ready to marry her ! 
to abandon his betrothed , a rare beauty , Katerina Ivanovna , who 's rich , and the daughter of a colonel , and to marry Grushenka , who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant , Samsonov , a coarse , uneducated , provincial mayor . 
Some murderous conflict may well come to pass from all this , and that 's what your brother Ivan is waiting for . 
It would suit him down to the ground .
