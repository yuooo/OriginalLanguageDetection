Because his father has been found murdered , because a witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his hand , and was knocked down by him : therefore , we are told , everything was done as he had planned in writing , and the letter was not ` absurd , ' but ` fatal . ' 
`` Now , thank God ! 
we 've come to the real point : ` since he was in the garden , he must have murdered him . ' 
In those few words : ` since he was , then he must ' lies the whole case for the prosecution . 
He was there , so he must have . 
And what if there is no must about it , even if he was there ? 
Oh , I admit that the chain of evidence - the coincidences - are really suggestive . 
But examine all these facts separately , regardless of their connection . 
Why , for instance , does the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner 's statement that he ran away from his father 's window ? 
Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the respectful and ` pious ' sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer .
