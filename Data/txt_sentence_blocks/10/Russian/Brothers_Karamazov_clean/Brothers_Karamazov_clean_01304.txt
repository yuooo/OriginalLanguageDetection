Mitya started , and at once left off laughing . 
The tall Pole rose upon his feet , and with the haughty air of a man , bored and out of his element , began pacing from corner to corner of the room , his hands behind his back . 
`` Ah , he ca n't sit still , '' said Grushenka , looking at him contemptuously . 
Mitya began to feel anxious . 
He noticed besides , that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression . 
`` Panie ! '' 
cried Mitya , `` Let 's drink ! 
and the other pan , too ! 
Let us drink . '' 
In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him , and filled them with champagne .
