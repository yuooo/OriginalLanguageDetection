But , gentlemen of the jury , why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion ? 
There are two persons - the prisoner and Smerdyakov . 
Why can I not say that you accuse my client , simply because you have no one else to accuse ? 
And you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion . 
`` It 's true , indeed , Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner , his two brothers , and Madame Svyetlov . 
But there are others who accuse him : there are vague rumours of a question , of a suspicion , an obscure report , a feeling of expectation . 
Finally , we have the evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive , though , I admit , inconclusive . 
In the first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit , for the genuineness of which the prosecutor , for some reason , has felt obliged to make a careful defence . 
Then Smerdyakov 's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial . 
Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the elder of the prisoner 's brothers , who had believed in his guilt , but has to-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer .
