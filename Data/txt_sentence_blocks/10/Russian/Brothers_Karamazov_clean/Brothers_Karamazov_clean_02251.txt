They worry over their ` wickedness , ' they are tormented by pangs of conscience , often entirely without cause ; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes . 
And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrongdoing by terror and intimidation . 
`` He had , besides , a strong presentiment that something terrible would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes . 
When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow , just before the catastrophe , Smerdyakov besought him to remain , though he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared . 
He confined himself to hints , but his hints were not understood . 
`` It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector , whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to pass . 
Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov 's drunken letter , ' I shall kill the old man , if only Ivan goes away . ' 
So Ivan Fyodorovitch 's presence seemed to everyone a guarantee of peace and order in the house . 
`` But he went away , and within an hour of his young master 's departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit . 
But that 's perfectly intelligible .
