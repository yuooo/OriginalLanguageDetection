cries the priest : ' O Sancta Maria , what do I hear ! 
Not the same man this time , how long is this going on ? 
Are n't you ashamed ! ' 
` Ah , mon pere , ' answers the sinner with tears of penitence , ` Ca lui fait tant de plaisir , et a moi si peu de peine ! ' 
* Fancy , such an answer ! 
I drew back . 
It was the cry of nature , better than innocence itself , if you like . 
I absolved her sin on the spot and was turning to go , but I was forced to turn back . 
I heard the priest at the grating making an appointment with her for the evening - though he was an old man hard as flint , he fell in an instant ! 
It was nature , the truth of nature asserted its rights !
