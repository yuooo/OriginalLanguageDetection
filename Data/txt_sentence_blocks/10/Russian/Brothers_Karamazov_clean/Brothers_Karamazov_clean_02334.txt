I should not have laughed at that in his place . 
Yes , such natures - oh , let me speak in defence of such natures , so often and so cruelly misunderstood - these natures often thirst for tenderness , goodness , and justice , as it were , in contrast to themselves , their unruliness , their ferocity - they thirst for it unconsciously . 
Passionate and fierce on the surface , they are painfully capable of loving woman , for instance , and with a spiritual and elevated love . 
Again do not laugh at me , this is very often the case in such natures . 
But they can not hide their passions - sometimes very coarse - and that is conspicuous and is noticed , but the inner man is unseen . 
Their passions are quickly exhausted ; but , by the side of a noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life , seeks to correct himself , to be better , to become noble and honourable , ` sublime and beautiful , ' however much the expression has been ridiculed . 
`` I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client 's engagement . 
But I may say half a word . 
What we heard just now was not evidence , but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman , and it was not for her - oh , not for her ! 
- to reproach him with treachery , for she has betrayed him !
