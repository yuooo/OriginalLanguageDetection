But here is a recent instance . 
A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos , which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge , and to go first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia : `` There is the place for thee and not here . '' 
The monk , overwhelmed with sorrow , went to the Oecumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him to release him from his obedience . 
But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable to release him , but there was not and could not be on earth a power which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that duty upon him . 
In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases with unbounded and inexplicable authority . 
That is why in many of our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to persecution . 
Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed among the people . 
Masses of the ignorant people as well as of distinction flocked , for instance , to the elders of our monastery to confess their doubts , their sins , and their sufferings , and ask for counsel and admonition . 
Seeing this , the opponents of the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously degraded , though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament . 
In the end , however , the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming established in Russian monasteries .
