I am in good spirits now , though I 've a pain in my forehead ... and in the top of my head ... only please do n't talk philosophy , as you did last time . 
If you ca n't take yourself off , talk of something amusing . 
Talk gossip , you are a poor relation , you ought to talk gossip . 
What a nightmare to have ! 
But I am not afraid of you . 
I 'll get the better of you . 
I wo n't be taken to a mad-house ! '' 
`` C'est charmant , poor relation . 
Yes , I am in my natural shape . 
For what am I on earth but a poor relation ?
