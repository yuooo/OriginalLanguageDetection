They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled .
