He even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression and that that would hasten his recovery . 
In spite of his alarm about Ilusha , he had not , till lately , felt one minute 's doubt of his boy 's ultimate recovery . 
He met his little visitors with homage , waited upon them hand and foot ; he was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back , but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up . 
He began buying little things for them , gingerbread and nuts , gave them tea and cut them sandwiches . 
It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money . 
He had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha had predicted he would . 
And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna , learning more about their circumstances and Ilusha 's illness , visited them herself , made the acquaintance of the family , and succeeded in fascinating the half-imbecile mother . 
Since then she had been lavish in helping them , and the captain , terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying , forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance . 
All this time Doctor Herzenstube , who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna , came punctually every other day , but little was gained by his visits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly . 
But on that Sunday morning a new doctor was expected , who had come from Moscow , where he had a great reputation .
