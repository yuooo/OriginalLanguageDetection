* You 'd better remain anonymous , ' they advised me . 
What use is a letter of thanks if it 's anonymous ? 
I laughed with the men at the newspaper office ; ` It 's reactionary to believe in God in our days , ' I said , ` but I am the devil , so I may be believed in . '

` Who does n't believe in the devil ? 
Yet it wo n't do , it might injure our reputation . 
As a joke , if you like . ' 
But I thought as a joke it would n't be very witty . 
So it was n't printed .
