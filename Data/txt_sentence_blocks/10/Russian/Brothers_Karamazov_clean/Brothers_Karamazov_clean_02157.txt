When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him , he scarcely tried to refute his evidence , but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal at Mokroe , a month before the arrest , when Timofey and another peasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles dropped by Mitya when he was drunk , and had given them to Trifon Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so . 
`` Well , '' asked the lawyer , '' did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr. Karamazov ? '' 
Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain ... . 
He was obliged , after the peasants had been examined , to admit the finding of the hundred roubles , only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri Fyodorovitch `` in perfect honesty , and it 's only because his honour was in liquor at the time , he would n't remember it . '' 
But , as he had denied the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove it , his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded with great suspicion . 
So one of the most dangerous witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again discredited . 
The same thing happened with the Poles . 
They took up an attitude of pride and independence ; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the service of the Crown , and that `` Pan Mitya '' had offered them three thousand `` to buy their honour , '' and that they had seen a large sum of money in his hands . 
Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words into his sentences , and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the eyes of the President and the prosecutor , grew more and more pompous , and ended by talking in Polish altogether . 
But Fetyukovitch caught them , too , in his snares .
