The President , turning to the prisoner , asked him whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness . 
`` Except about the door , all he has said is true , '' cried Mitya , in a loud voice . 
`` For combing the lice off me , I thank him ; for forgiving my blows , I thank him . 
The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred poodles . '' 
`` Prisoner , be careful in your language , '' the President admonished him . 
`` I am not a poodle , '' Grigory muttered . 
`` All right , it 's I am a poodle myself , '' cried Mitya . 
`` If it 's an insult , I take it to myself and I beg his pardon . 
I was a beast and cruel to him . 
I was cruel to Aesop too . ''
