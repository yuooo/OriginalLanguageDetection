Mitya paused for a minute and said suddenly : `` And how they worked it up at the trial ! 
Did n't they work it up ! '' 
`` If they had not , you would have been convicted just the same , '' said Alyosha , with a sigh . 
`` Yes , people are sick of me here ! 
God bless them , but it 's hard , '' Mitya moaned miserably . 
Again there was silence for a minute . 
`` Alyosha , put me out of my misery at once ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly . 
`` Tell me , is she coming now , or not ? 
Tell me ?
