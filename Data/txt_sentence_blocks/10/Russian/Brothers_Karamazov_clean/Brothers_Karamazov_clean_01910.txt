I wo n't tell you the details : it 's all been thought out : it can all be arranged . 
Hush , do n't decide . 
I should go to America with Grusha . 
You know I ca n't live without Grusha ! 
What if they wo n't let her follow me to Siberia ? 
Do they let convicts get married ? 
Ivan thinks not . 
And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer ? 
I should only smash my skull with the hammer ! 
But , on the other hand , my conscience ?
