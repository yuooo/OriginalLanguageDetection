that 's what they 'll write on the banner , which they will raise against Thee , and with which they will destroy Thy temple . 
Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building ; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again , and though , like the one of old , it will not be finished , yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years ; for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower . 
They will seek us again , hidden underground in the catacombs , for we shall be again persecuted and tortured . 
They will find us and cry to us , `` Feed us , for those who have promised us fire from heaven have n't given it ! '' 
And then we shall finish building their tower , for he finishes the building who feeds them . 
And we alone shall feed them in Thy name , declaring falsely that it is in Thy name . 
Oh , never , never can they feed themselves without us ! 
No science will give them bread so long as they remain free . 
In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet , and say to us , `` Make us your slaves , but feed us . '' 
They will understand themselves , at last , that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together , for never , never will they be able to share between them !
