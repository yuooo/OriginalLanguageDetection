cried Mitya . 
`` Trifon Borissovitch , some more bottles ! '' 
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table . 
Mitya filled the glasses . 
`` To Russia ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
he shouted again . 
All drank the toast except the Poles , and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once . 
The Poles did not touch theirs . 
`` How 's this , Panovie ? ''
