The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply . 
Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov exclaimed : `` There 's Ilusha 's stone , under which they wanted to bury him . '' 
They all stood still by the big stone . 
Alyosha looked and the whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day , how Ilusha , weeping and hugging his father , had cried , `` Father , father , how he insulted you , '' rose at once before his imagination . 
A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul . 
With a serious and earnest expression he looked from one to another of the bright , pleasant faces of Ilusha 's schoolfellows , and suddenly said to them : `` Boys , I should like to say one word to you , here at this place . '' 
The boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes upon him . 
`` Boys , we shall soon part . 
I shall be for some time with my two brothers , of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death 's door . 
But soon I shall leave this town , perhaps for a long time , so we shall part .
