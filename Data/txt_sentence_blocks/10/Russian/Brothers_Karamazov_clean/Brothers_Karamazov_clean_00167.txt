That question you have not answered , and it is your great grief , for it clamours for an answer . '' 
`` But can it be answered by me ? 
Answered in the affirmative ? '' 
Ivan went on asking strangely , still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable smile . 
`` If it ca n't be decided in the affirmative , it will never be decided in the negative . 
You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart , and all its suffering is due to it . 
But thank the Creator who has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering ; of thinking and seeking higher things , for our dwelling is in the heavens . 
God grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth , and may God bless your path . '' 
The elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross over Ivan from where he stood . 
But the latter rose from his seat , went up to him , received his blessing , and kissing his hand went back to his place in silence .
