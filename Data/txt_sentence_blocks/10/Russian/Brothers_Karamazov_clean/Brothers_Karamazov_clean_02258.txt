A weighty question , truly ! 
And the facts to confirm it are astounding . 
One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit , apparently to arouse suspicion in everyone , alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory . 
It would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan . 
`` But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov 's part , but only of passive acquiescence ; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder , and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered , without screaming for help or resisting , he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit - ` you may murder him as you like ; it 's nothing to me . ' 
But as this attack of Smerdyakov 's was bound to throw the household into confusion , Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such a plan . 
I will waive that point however . 
Supposing that he did agree , it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the instigator , and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice , and not even an accomplice , but merely acquiesced against his will through terror . 
`` But what do we see ? 
As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly throws all the blame on Smerdyakov , not accusing him of being his accomplice , but of being himself the murderer .
