I found in him no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted . 
There was no simplicity about him , either . 
I found in him , on the contrary , an extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of naivete , and an intelligence of considerable range . 
The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak-minded . 
He made a very definite impression on me : I left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature , excessively ambitious , vindictive , and intensely envious . 
I made some inquiries : he resented his parentage , was ashamed of it , and would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of ` stinking Lizaveta . ' 
He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife , who had cared for him in his childhood . 
He cursed and jeered at Russia . 
He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman . 
He used often to say that he had n't the means to do so .
