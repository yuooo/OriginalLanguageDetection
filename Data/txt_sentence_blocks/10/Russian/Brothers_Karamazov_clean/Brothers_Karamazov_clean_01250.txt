`` I Am Coming , Too ! '' 
BUT Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road . 
It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe , but Andrey 's three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter . 
The swift motion revived Mitya . 
The air was fresh and cool , there were big stars shining in the sky . 
It was the very night , and perhaps the very hour , in which Alyosha fell on the earth , and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever . 
All was confusion , confusion in Mitya 's soul , but although many things were goading his heart , at that moment his whole being was yearning for her , his queen , to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time . 
One thing I can say for certain ; his heart did not waver for one instant . 
I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival , who seemed to have sprung out of the earth . 
If any other had appeared on the scene , he would have been jealous at once , and would-perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again .
