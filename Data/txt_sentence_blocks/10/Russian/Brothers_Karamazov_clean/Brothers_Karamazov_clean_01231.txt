`` That 's not what I mean . 
I 'm talking of a higher order . 
There 's no order in me , no higher order . 
But ... that 's all over . 
There 's no need to grieve about it . 
It 's too late , damn it ! 
My whole life has been disorder , and one must set it in order . 
Is that a pun , eh ? '' 
`` You 're raving , not making puns ! 
`` Glory be to God in Heaven , Glory be to God in me ... `` That verse came from my heart once , it 's not a verse , but a tear ... .
