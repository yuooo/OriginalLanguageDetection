`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya .

There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes .
