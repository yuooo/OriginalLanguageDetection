This was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts . 
It was known that two women rivals were to appear in the case . 
One of them - Katerina Ivanovna - was an object of general interest . 
All sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her , amazing anecdotes of her passion for Mitya , in spite of his crime . 
Her pride and `` aristocratic connections '' were particularly insisted upon -LRB- she had called upon scarcely anyone in the town -RRB- . 
People said she intended to petition the Government for leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him somewhere in the mines . 
The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no less impatience . 
The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity to the meeting of the two rivals - the proud aristocratic girl and `` the hetaira . '' 
But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of the district than Katerina Ivanovna . 
They had already seen `` the woman who had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son , '' and all , almost without exception , wondered how father and son could be so in love with `` such a very common , ordinary Russian girl , who was not even pretty . ''
