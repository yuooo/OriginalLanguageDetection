`` Well , you may go to the devil ! '' 
cried Pyotr Ilyitch , on second thoughts . 
`` What 's it to do with me ? 
Throw away your money , since it 's cost you nothing . '' 
`` This way , my economist , this way , do n't be angry . '' 
Mitya drew him into a room at the back of the shop . 
`` They 'll give us a bottle here directly . 
We 'll taste it . 
Ech , Pyotr Ilyitch , come along with me , for you 're a nice fellow , the sort I like . '' 
Mitya sat down on a wicker chair , before a little table , covered with a dirty dinner-napkin .
