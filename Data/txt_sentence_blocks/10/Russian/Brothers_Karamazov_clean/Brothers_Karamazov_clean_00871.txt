The monks , who had gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima , had all been his devoted friends for many years . 
There were four of them : Father Iosif and Father Paissy , Father Mihail the warden of the hermitage , a man not very old and far from being learned . 
He was of humble origin , of strong will and steadfast faith , of austere appearance , but of deep tenderness , though he obviously concealed it as though he were almost ashamed of it . 
The fourth , Father Anfim , was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest peasant class . 
He was almost illiterate , and very quiet , scarcely speaking to anyone . 
He was the humblest of the humble , and looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful beyond the scope of his intelligence . 
Father Zossima had a great affection for this timorous man , and always treated him with marked respect , though perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less , in spite of the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him . 
That was very long ago , forty years before , when Father Zossima first began his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma , and when , shortly after , he had accompanied Father Anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms for their poor monastery . 
The whole party were in the bedroom which , as we mentioned before , was very small , so that there was scarcely room for the four of them -LRB- in addition to Porfiry , the novice , who stood -RRB- to sit round Father Zossima on chairs brought from the sitting room . 
It was already beginning to get dark , the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the ikons .
