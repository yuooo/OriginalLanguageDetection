`` There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin - this is the man , '' Kolya pointed to Alyosha . 
`` I obey him , good-bye ! '' 
He stepped forward , opened the door , and quickly went into the inner room . 
Perezvon flew after him . 
The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement , looking at Alyosha ; then , with a curse , he went out quickly to the carriage , repeating aloud , `` This is ... this is ... I do n't know what it is ! '' 
The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage . 
Alyosha followed Kolya into the room . 
He was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his father . 
A minute later the captain , too , came back .
