`` His , his , and he is very keen on it . 
He did n't come to see me at first , then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away . 
He is awfully keen on it . 
He does n't ask me , but orders me to escape . 
He does n't doubt of my obeying him , though I showed him all my heart as I have to you , and told him about the hymn , too . 
He told me he 'd arrange it ; he 's found out about everything . 
But of that later . 
He 's simply set on it . 
It 's all a matter of money : he 'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for America . 
And he says we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand . ''
