Alyosha went in . 
Lise looked rather embarrassed , and at once flushed crimson . 
She was evidently ashamed of something , and , as people always do in such cases , she began immediately talking of other things , as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment . 
`` Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles , Alexey Fyodorovitch , and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know , although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to another ... I cried when I heard . 
Well , did you give him the money and how is that poor man getting on ? '' 
`` The fact is I did n't give it to him , and it 's a long story , '' answered Alyosha , as though he , too , could think of nothing but his regret at having failed , yet Lise saw perfectly well that he , too , looked away , and that he , too , was trying to talk of other things . 
Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story , but at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise 's attention as well . 
He spoke with deep feeling , under the influence of the strong impression he had just received , and he succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially . 
In old days in Moscow he had been fond of coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him , what he had read , or what he remembered of his childhood . 
Sometimes they had made day-dreams and woven whole romances together - generally cheerful and amusing ones .
