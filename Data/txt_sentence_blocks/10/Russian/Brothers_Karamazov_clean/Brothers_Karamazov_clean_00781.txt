but receiving no answer , he adds at once . 
` Do n't answer , be silent . 
What canst Thou say , indeed ? 
I know too well what Thou wouldst say . 
And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old . 
Why , then , art Thou come to hinder us ? 
For Thou hast come to hinder us , and Thou knowest that . 
But dost thou know what will be to-morrow ? 
I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him , but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics . 
And the very people who have to-day kissed Thy feet , to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire .
