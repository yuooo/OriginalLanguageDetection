`` That 's just why you must go now , to avoid meeting anyone . 
There will be no one there , I can tell you that for certain . 
We will expect you , '' he concluded emphatically , and went out of the room . 
For a Moment the Lie Becomes Truth HE hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now . 
The day after his fate was determined , Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever , and was sent to the prison division of the town hospital . 
But at the request of several persons -LRB- Alyosha , Madame Hohlakov , Lise , etc. -RRB- , Doctor Varvinsky had put Mitya not with other prisoners , but in a separate little room , the one where Smerdyakov had been . 
It is true that there was a sentinel at the other end of the corridor , and there was a grating over the window , so that Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown , which was not quite legal , indeed ; but he was a kind-hearted and compassionate young man . 
He knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass at once so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers , and that he must get used to it by degrees . 
The visits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer , and even by the police captain . 
But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya .
