`` Stay , '' cried Ivan pondering . 
`` What about the door ? 
If he only opened the door to you , how could Grigory have seen it open before ? 
For Grigory saw it before you went . '' 
It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably , in a different tone , not angry as before , so if anyone had opened the door at that moment and peeped in at them , he would certainly have concluded that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary , though interesting , subject . 
`` As for that door and having seen it open , that 's only his fancy , '' said Smerdyakov , with a wry smile . 
`` He is not a man , I assure you , but an obstinate mule . 
He did n't see it , but fancied he had seen it , and there 's no shaking him . 
It 's just our luck he took that notion into his head , for they ca n't fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that . '' 
`` Listen ... '' said Ivan , beginning to seem bewildered again and making an effort to grasp something .
