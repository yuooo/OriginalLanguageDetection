People had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunk in a tavern . 
Two days before her death , he had run away , staying no one knew where in the town . 
The day after the murder , he was found on the road leading out of the town , dead drunk , with a knife in his pocket , and his right hand happened to be stained with blood . 
He declared that his nose had been bleeding , but no one believed him . 
The maids confessed that they had gone to a party and that the street door had been left open till they returned . 
And a number of similar details came to light , throwing suspicion on the innocent servant . 
They arrested him , and he was tried for the murder ; but a week after the arrest , the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the hospital . 
There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and everyone in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital . 
And after that the punishment began . 
My mysterious visitor , now my friend , told me that at first he was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience .
