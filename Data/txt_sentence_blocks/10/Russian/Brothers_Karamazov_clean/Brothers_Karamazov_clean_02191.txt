But he 's always besought me not to tell anyone here of it , he is so dreadfully ashamed of me . '' 
This fact was a complete surprise to everyone ; no one in the town nor in the monastery , not even Mitya , knew of it . 
I was told that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat . 
Grushenka had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya , and so she was angry . 
The whole effect on the public , of Rakitin 's speech , of his noble sentiments , of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia , was this time finally ruined . 
Fetyukovitch was satisfied : it was another godsend . 
Grushenka 's cross-examination did not last long and , of course , there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence . 
She left a very disagreeable impression on the public ; hundreds of contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her , as she finished giving her evidence and sat down again in the court , at a good distance from Katerina Ivanovna . 
Mitya was silent throughout her evidence . 
He sat as though turned to stone , with his eyes fixed on the ground .
