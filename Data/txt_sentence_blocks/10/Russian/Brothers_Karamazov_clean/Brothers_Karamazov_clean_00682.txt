Even if you do n't agree with me , I shall do my duty in the most important things . '' 
`` That 's right ; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters , but in everything . 
And I am ready to vow to do so now - in everything , and for all my life ! '' 
cried Lise fervently , `` and I 'll do it gladly , gladly ! 
What 's more , I 'll swear never to spy on you , never once , never to read one of your letters . 
For you are right and I am not . 
And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy , I know that I wo n't do it since you consider it dishonourable . 
You are my conscience now ... . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch , why have you been so sad lately - both yesterday and to-day ? 
I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble , but I see you have some special grief besides , some secret one , perhaps ? ''
