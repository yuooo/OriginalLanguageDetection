Ivan was called to give evidence . 
A Sudden Catastrophe I MAY note that he had been called before Alyosha . 
But the usher of the court announced to the President that , owing to an attack of illness or some sort of fit , the witness could not appear at the moment , but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered . 
But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later . 
His entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed . 
The principal witnesses , especially the two rival ladies , had already been questioned . 
Curiosity was satisfied for the time ; the public was feeling almost fatigued . 
Several more witnesses were still to be heard , who probably had little information to give after all that had been given . 
Time was passing . 
Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness , looking at no one , and with his head bowed , as though plunged in gloomy thought .
