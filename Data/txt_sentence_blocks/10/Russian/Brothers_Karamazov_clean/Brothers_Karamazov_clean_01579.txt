This would explain the circumstance , so baffling for the prosecution , that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya 's hands . 
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which , insignificant as it was , had hitherto told , to some extent , in Mitya 's favour . 
Now this one piece of evidence in his favour had broken down . 
In answer to the prosecutor 's inquiry , where he would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles , since he himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred , Mitya confidently replied that he had meant to offer the `` little chap , '' not money , but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya , those rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov . 
The prosecutor positively smiled at the `` innocence of this subterfuge . '' 
`` And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash ? '' 
`` He certainly would have accepted it , '' Mitya declared warmly . 
`` Why , look here , he might have grabbed not two thousand , but four or six , for it . 
He would have put his lawyers , Poles and Jews , on to the job , and might have got , not three thousand , but the whole property out of the old man . '' 
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was , of course , entered in the protocol in the fullest detail .
