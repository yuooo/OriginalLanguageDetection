If Dmitri were not there , thought Alyosha , he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house , but would remain hidden in the summer-house , even if he had to wait there till evening . 
If , as before , Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come , he would be very likely to come to the summer-house . 
Alyosha did not , however , give much thought to the details of his plan , but resolved to act upon it , even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day . 
Everything happened without hindrance , he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before , and stole into the summer-house unseen . 
He did not want to be noticed . 
The woman of the house and Foma too , if he were here , might be loyal to his brother and obey his instructions , and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden , or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for . 
There was no one in the summer-house . 
Alyosha sat down and began to wait . 
He looked round the summer-house , which somehow struck him as a great deal more ancient than before . 
Though the day was just as fine as yesterday , it seemed a wretched little place this time .
