What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature . 
There was a childlike look in her eyes , a look of childish delight . 
She came up to the table , beaming with delight and seeming to expect something with childish , impatient , and confiding curiosity . 
The light in her eyes gladdened the soul - Alyosha felt that . 
There was something else in her which he could not understand , or would not have been able to define , and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him . 
It was that softness , that voluptuousness of her bodily movements , that catlike noiselessness . 
Yet it was a vigorous , ample body . 
Under the shawl could be seen full broad shoulders , a high , still quite girlish bosom . 
Her figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo , though already in somewhat exaggerated proportions . 
That could be divined .
