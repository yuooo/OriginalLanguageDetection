`` Once in olden times a holy saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one , her only one , whom God had taken . 
` Knowest thou not , ' said the saint to her , ` how bold these little ones are before the throne of God ? 
Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven . 
`` Thou didst give us life , O Lord , '' they say , `` and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again . '' 
And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the rank of angels . 
Therefore , ' said the saint , ` thou , too , O Mother , rejoice and weep not , for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship of the angels . ' 
That 's what the saint said to the weeping mother of old . 
He was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely . 
Therefore you too , mother , know that your little one is surely before the throne of God , is rejoicing and happy , and praying to God for you , and therefore weep , but rejoice . '' 
The woman listened to him , looking down with her cheek in her hand .
