It 's base , because I told you that myself . 
I not only wanted to murder him , but I might have done it . 
And , what 's more , I went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him . 
But , you see , I did n't murder him ; you see , my guardian angel saved me - that 's what you 've not taken into account . 
And that 's why it 's so base of you . 
For I did n't kill him , I did n't kill him ! 
Do you hear , I did not kill him . '' 
He was almost choking . 
He had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation .
