If once he had taken an idea into his head , there was no shaking it . 
Almost everyone in the town was aware , by the way , that the famous doctor had , within the first two or three days of his presence among us , uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube 's qualifications . 
Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five roubles for a visit , several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his arrival , and rushed to consult him regardless of expense . 
All these had , of course , been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube , and the celebrated doctor had criticised his treatment with extreme harshness . 
Finally , he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them , `` Well , who has been cramming you with nostrums ? 
Herzenstube ? 
He he ! '' 
Doctor Herzenstube , of course , heard all this , and now all the three doctors made their appearance , one after another , to be examined . 
Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner 's mental faculties was self-evident . 
Then giving his grounds for this opinion , which I omit here , he added that the abnormality was not only evident in many of the prisoner 's actions in the past , but was apparent even now at this very moment .
