On hearing this fact , the priest dropped the subject , though he would have done well to put into words his doubt whether , if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant , calling him Lyagavy , there was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into ridicule . 
But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles . 
He hurried , striding along , and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realise that they had come not one verst , nor one and a half , but at least three . 
This annoyed him , but he controlled himself . 
They went into the hut . 
The forester lived in one half of the hut , and Gorstkin was lodging in the other , the better room the other side of the passage . 
They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle . 
The hut was extremely overheated . 
On the table there was a samovar that had gone out , a tray with cups , an empty rum bottle , a bottle of vodka partly full , and some half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread . 
The visitor himself lay stretched at full length on the bench , with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow , snoring heavily .
