`` I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all , '' chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` for after all what does it amount to ? '' 
`` Why , that I stole it , that 's what it amounts to ! 
Oh , God , you horrify me by not understanding ! 
Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck , every day and every hour I said to myself , ` You 're a thief ! 
you 're a thief ! ' 
Yes , that 's why I 've been so savage all this month , that 's why I fought in the tavern , that 's why I attacked my father , it was because I felt I was a thief . 
I could n't make up my mind ; I did n't dare even to tell Alyosha , my brother , about that fifteen hundred : I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket . 
But , do you know , while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour : ` No , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you may yet not be a thief . ' 
Why ? 
Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya .
