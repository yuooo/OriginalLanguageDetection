`` I 'm afraid , sir , '' Andrey . 
`` Give me five roubles extra , but more I wo n't take . 
Trifon Borissovitch , bear witness . 
Forgive my foolish words ... '' `` What are you afraid of ? '' 
asked Mitya , scanning him . 
`` Well , go to the devil , if that 's it ? '' 
he cried , flinging him five roubles . 
`` Now , Trifon Borissovitch , take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them , so that they do n't see me . 
Where are they ? 
In the blue room ? ''
