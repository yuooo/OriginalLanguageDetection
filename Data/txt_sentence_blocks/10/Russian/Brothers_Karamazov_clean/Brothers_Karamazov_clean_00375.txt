If I had believed then in very truth , as I ought to have believed , then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith , and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith . 
But , of course , it would n't have come to torture then , because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain , ` Move and crush the tormentor , ' and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black-beetle , and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened , praising and glorifying God . 
But , suppose at that very moment I had tried all that , and cried to that mountain , ` Crush these tormentors , ' and it had n't crushed them , how could I have helped doubting , pray , at such a time , and at such a dread hour of mortal terror ? 
And apart from that , I should know already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven -LRB- for since the mountain had not moved at my word , they could not think very much of my faith up aloft , and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come -RRB- . 
So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well , and to no good purpose ? 
For , even though they had flayed my skin half off my back , even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry . 
And at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose one 's reason from fear , so that one would not be able to think at all . 
And , therefore , how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or here , I should , at least , save my skin . 
And so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether forgiven . '' 
Over the Brandy THE controversy was over .
