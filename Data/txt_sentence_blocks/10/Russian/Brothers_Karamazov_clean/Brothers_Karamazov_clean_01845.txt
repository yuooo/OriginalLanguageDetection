`` You take evil for good ; it 's a passing crisis ; it 's the result of your illness , perhaps . '' 
`` You do despise me , though ! 
It 's simply that I do n't want to do good , I want to do evil , and it has nothing to do with illness . '' 
`` Why do evil ? '' 
`` So that everything might be destroyed . 
Ah , how nice it would be if everything were destroyed ! 
You know , Alyosha , I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad , and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it out . 
Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all . 
That would be awfully nice . 
Why would it be so nice , Alyosha ? ''
