`` In active love ? 
There 's another question and such a question ! 
You see , I so love humanity that - would you believe it ? 
- I often dream of forsaking all that I have , leaving Lise , and becoming a sister of mercy . 
I close my eyes and think and dream , and at that moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles . 
No wounds , no festering sores could at that moment frighten me . 
I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands . 
I would nurse the afflicted . 
I would be ready to kiss such wounds . '' 
`` It is much , and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not others .
