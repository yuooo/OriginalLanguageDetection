No , I swear I did n't ! '' 
shouted Ivan , grinding his teeth . 
`` You did n't ? 
Then you ought , as your father 's son , to have had me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least , to have given me a punch in the face on the spot , but you were not a bit angry , if you please , and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away , which was utterly absurd , for you ought to have stayed to save your parent 's life . 
How could I help drawing my conclusions ? '' 
Ivan sat scowling , both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees . 
`` Yes , I am sorry I did n't punch you in the face , '' he said with a bitter smile . 
`` I could n't have taken you to the lock-up just then . 
Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against you ? 
But the punch in the face ... oh , I 'm sorry I did n't think of it .
