A year before the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him . 
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go . 
The journey was not an expensive one , and the ladies would not let him pawn his watch , a parting present from his benefactor 's family . 
They provided him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new clothes and linen . 
But he returned half the money they gave him , saying that he intended to go third class . 
On his arrival in the town he made no answer to his father 's first inquiry why he had come before completing his studies , and seemed , so they say , unusually thoughtful . 
It soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother 's tomb . 
He practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only object of his visit . 
But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it . 
It is more probable that he himself did not understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul , and drawn him irresistibly into a new , unknown , but inevitable path .
