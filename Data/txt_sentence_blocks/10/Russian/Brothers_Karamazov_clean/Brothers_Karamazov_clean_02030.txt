He ran to the window , put the candle in the window . 
` Grushenka , ' he cried , ` Grushenka , are you here ? ' 
Though he cried that , he did n't want to lean out of the window , he did n't want to move away from me , for he was panic-stricken ; he was so frightened he did n't dare to turn his back on me . 
` Why , here she is , ' said I. I went up to the window and leaned right out of it . 
` Here she is ; she 's in the bush , laughing at you , do n't you see her ? ' 
He suddenly believed it ; he was all of a shake - he was awfully crazy about her - and he leaned right out of the window . 
I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his table ; do you remember , weighing about three pounds ? 
I swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the corner of it . 
He did n't even cry out . 
He only sank down suddenly , and I hit him again and a third time .
