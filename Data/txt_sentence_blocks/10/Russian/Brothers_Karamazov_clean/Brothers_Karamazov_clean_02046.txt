Seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up , knocked at the shutters , and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the police station , promising him three roubles . 
The man got ready and came out . 
I wo n't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his object , bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for a doctor to see him at once , providing with a liberal hand for the expenses . 
I will only say that this business took a whole hour , but Ivan was well content with it . 
His mind wandered and worked incessantly . 
`` If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow , '' he reflected with satisfaction , `` I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after the peasant , but should have passed by , without caring about his being frozen . 
I am quite capable of watching myself , by the way , '' he thought at the same instant , with still greater satisfaction , `` although they have decided that I am going out of my mind ! '' 
Just as he reached his own house he stopped short , asking himself suddenly had n't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything . 
He decided the question by turning back to the house . 
`` Everything together to-morrow ! ''
