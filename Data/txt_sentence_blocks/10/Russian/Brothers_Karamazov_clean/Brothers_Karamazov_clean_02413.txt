It was his habit to call Ilusha `` old man , '' as a term of affection when he was alive . 
`` Father , give me a flower , too ; take that white one out of his hand and give it me , '' the crazy mother begged , whimpering . 
Either because the little white rose in Ilusha 's hand had caught her fancy or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him , she moved restlessly , stretching out her hands for the flower . 
`` I wo n't give it to anyone , I wo n't give you anything , '' Snegiryov cried callously . 
`` They are his flowers , not yours ! 
Everything is his , nothing is yours ! '' 
`` Father , give mother a flower ! '' 
said Nina , lifting her face wet with tears . 
`` I wo n't give away anything and to her less than anyone ! 
She did n't love Ilusha .
