I sha n't forget it . 
You 've no heart , any of you that 's what it is ! 
What 's a day or two to you ? 
Where are you going now - to Venice ? 
Your Venice will keep another two days . 
I would have sent Alyosha , but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that ? 
I send you just because you are a clever fellow . 
Do you suppose I do n't see that ? 
You know nothing about timber , but you 've got an eye . 
All that is wanted is to see whether the man is in earnest .
