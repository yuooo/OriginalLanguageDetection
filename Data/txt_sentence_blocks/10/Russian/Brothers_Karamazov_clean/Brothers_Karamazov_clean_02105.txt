`` It 's not here . 
Do n't worry yourself . 
I know where it is - here , '' said Alyosha , finding a clean towel , folded up and unused , by Ivan 's dressing-table in the other corner of the room . 
Ivan looked strangely at the towel : recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant . 
`` Stay '' - he got up from the sofa - `` an hour ago I took that new towel from there and wetted it . 
I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ... How is it it 's dry ? 
There was no other . '' 
`` You put that towel on your head ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles burnt down so ?
