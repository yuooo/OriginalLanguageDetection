Who helped you to sew it up a month ago ? '' 
`` No one helped me . 
I did it myself . '' 
`` Can you sew ? '' 
`` A soldier has to know how to sew . 
No knowledge was needed to do that . '' 
`` Where did you get the material , that is , the rag in which you sewed the money ? '' 
`` Are you laughing at me ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
And we are in no mood for laughing , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . ''
