Mitya set an easy chair for her . 
She had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing `` the time before , '' when they had made merry there . 
All the girls who had come had been there then ; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come , too , and at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions . 
Mitya bustled about . 
All sorts of people began coming into the room to look on , peasants and their women , who had been roused from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvellous entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before . 
Mitya remembered their faces , greeting and embracing everyone he knew . 
He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for everyone who presented himself . 
Only the girls were very eager for the champagne . 
The men preferred rum , brandy , and , above all , hot punch . 
Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls , and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself .
