The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind . 
But he softly smiled , blew softly on the friendly phantoms , and they flew away . 
`` There 's plenty of time for them , '' he thought . 
They reached the station quickly , changed horses , and galloped to Volovya `` Why is it worth while speaking to a clever man ? 
What did he mean by that ? '' 
The thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing . 
`` And why did I tell him I was going to Tchermashnya ? '' 
They reached Volovya station . 
Ivan got out of the carriage , and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya . 
He told them to harness the horses .
