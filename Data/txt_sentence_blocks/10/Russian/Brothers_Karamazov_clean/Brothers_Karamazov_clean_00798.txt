But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood . 
And we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup , and on it will be written , `` Mystery . '' 
But then , and only then , the reign of peace and happiness will come for men . 
Thou art proud of Thine elect , but Thou hast only the elect , while we give rest to all . 
And besides , how many of those elect , those mighty ones who could become elect , have grown weary waiting for Thee , and have transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp , and end by raising their free banner against Thee . 
Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner . 
But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom . 
Oh , we shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us . 
And shall we be right or shall we be lying ? 
They will be convinced that we are right , for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them .
