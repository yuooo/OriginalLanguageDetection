But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya 's inheritance , and confined himself to contemptuous generalities . 
`` Who could tell which of them was to blame , and which was in debt to the other , with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one could make head or tail of it ? '' 
He attributed the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia , due to the lack of appropriate institutions . 
He was , in fact , allowed some latitude of speech . 
This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he could do , and attracted notice . 
The prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the case , and afterwards in his speech , as we shall see later , quoted some ideas from the article , showing that he had seen it already . 
The picture drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one , and greatly strengthened the case for the prosecution . 
Altogether , Rakatin 's discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility of its ideas . 
There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia . 
But Rakitin , in his youthful ardour , made a slight blunder , of which the counsel for the defence at once adroitly took advantage .
