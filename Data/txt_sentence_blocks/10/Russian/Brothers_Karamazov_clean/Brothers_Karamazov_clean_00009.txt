He saw and knew his father , Fyodor Pavlovitch , for the first time on coming of age , when he visited our neighbourhood on purpose to settle with him about his property . 
He seems not to have liked his father . 
He did not stay long with him , and made haste to get away , having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money , and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate , of the revenues and value of which he was unable -LRB- a fact worthy of note -RRB- , upon this occasion , to get a statement from his father . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then -LRB- this , too , should be noted -RRB- that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this , as it fell in with his own designs . 
He gathered only that the young man was frivolous , unruly , of violent passions , impatient , and dissipated , and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied , although only , of course , a short time . 
So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact , sending him from time to time small doles , instalments . 
In the end , when four years later , Mitya , losing patience , came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father , it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing , that it was difficult to get an account even , that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch , and was perhaps even in debt to him , that by various agreements into which he had , of his own desire , entered at various previous dates , he had no right to expect anything more , and so on , and so on . 
The young man was overwhelmed , suspected deceit and cheating , and was almost beside himself . 
And , indeed , this circumstance led to the catastrophe , the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story , or rather the external side of it .
