Ah , you put me out ! 
Ah ! 
this trial , this savage act , and then they are all going to Siberia , some are getting married , and all this so quickly , so quickly , everything 's changing , and at last - nothing . 
All grow old and have death to look forward to . 
Well , so be it ! 
I am weary . 
This Katya , cette charmante personne , has disappointed all my hopes . 
Now she is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia , and your other brother is going to follow her , and will live in the nearest town , and they will all torment one another . 
It drives me out of my mind . 
Worst of all - the publicity .
