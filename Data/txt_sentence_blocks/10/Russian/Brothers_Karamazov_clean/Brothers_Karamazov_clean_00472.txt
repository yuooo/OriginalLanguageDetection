`` You 're raving ! 
Grushenka with her ? '' 
Alyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to Katerina Ivanovna 's . 
He was ten minutes telling his story . 
ca n't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively , but he seemed to make it clear , not omitting any word or action of significance , and vividly describing , often in one word , his own sensations . 
Dmitri listened in silence , gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare , but it was clear to Alyosha that he understood it all , and had grasped every point . 
But as the story went on , his face became not merely gloomy , but menacing . 
He scowled , he clenched his teeth , and his fixed stare became still more rigid , more concentrated , more terrible , when suddenly , with incredible rapidity , his wrathful , savage face changed , his tightly compressed lips parted , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled , spontaneous laughter . 
He literally shook with laughter . 
For a long time he could not speak .
