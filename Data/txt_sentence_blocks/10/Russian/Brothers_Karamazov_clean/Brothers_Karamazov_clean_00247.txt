His wife , Marfa Ignatyevna , had obeyed her husband 's will implicitly all her life , yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs . 
She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small savings . 
But Grigory decided then , once for all , that `` the woman 's talking nonsense , for every woman is dishonest , '' and that they ought not to leave their old master , whatever he might be , for `` that was now their duty . '' 
`` Do you understand what duty is ? '' 
he asked Marfa Ignatyevna . 
`` I understand what duty means , Grigory Vassilyevitch , but why it 's our duty to stay here I never shall understand , '' Marfa answered firmly . 
`` Well , do n't understand then . 
But so it shall be . 
And you hold your tongue . '' 
And so it was .
