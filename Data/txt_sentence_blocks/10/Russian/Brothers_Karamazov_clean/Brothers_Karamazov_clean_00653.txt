`` A pretty trick , '' whispered the captain . 
His mouth was twisted on the left side , his left eye was screwed up . 
He still stared at Alyosha . 
`` What is the matter ? 
What trick ? '' 
Alyosha cried , now thoroughly alarmed . 
`` Why , look , '' squealed the captain suddenly , and showing him the two notes which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger during the conversation , he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them tight in his right hand . 
`` Do you see , do you see ? '' 
he shrieked , pale and infuriated . 
And suddenly flinging up his hand , he threw the crumpled notes on the sand .
