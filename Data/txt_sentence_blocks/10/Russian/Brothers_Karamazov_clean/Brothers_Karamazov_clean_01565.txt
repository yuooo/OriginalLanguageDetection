`` It 's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place . '' 
`` Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow , and perhaps you 'll find it , '' said Mitya sneering .

`` I see you do n't believe me ! 
Not for a moment ! 
It 's my fault , not yours . 
I ought not to have been so ready .
