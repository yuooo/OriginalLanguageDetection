When he came to telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov , he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case . 
But the investigating lawyer stopped him , and civilly suggested that he should pass on to `` more essential matters . '' 
At last , when he described his despair and told them how , when he left Madame Hohlakov 's , he thought that he 'd `` get three thousand if he had to murder someone to do it , '' they stopped him again and noted down that he had `` meant to murder someone . '' 
Mitya let them write it without protest . 
At last he reached the point in his story when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov 's as soon as he left her there , though she had said that she would stay there till midnight . 
`` If I did n't kill Fenya then , gentlemen , it was only because I had n't time , '' broke from him suddenly at that point in his story . 
That , too , was carefully written down . 
Mitya waited gloomily , and was beginning to tell how he ran into his father 's garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him , and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass pestle . 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
he asked , showing it to Mitya .
