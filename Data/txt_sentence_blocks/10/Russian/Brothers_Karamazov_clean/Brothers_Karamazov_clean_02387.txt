`` Perhaps she does not . 
Only she is not coming this morning , '' Mitya hastened to explain again ; `` I asked her to do something for me . 
You know , Ivan is superior to all of us . 
He ought to live , not us . 
He will recover . '' 
`` Would you believe it , though Katya is alarmed about him , she scarcely doubts of his recovery , '' said Alyosha . 
`` That means that she is convinced he will die . 
It 's because she is frightened she 's so sure he will get well . '' 
`` Ivan has a strong constitution , and I , too , believe there 's every hope that he will get well , '' Alyosha observed anxiously .
