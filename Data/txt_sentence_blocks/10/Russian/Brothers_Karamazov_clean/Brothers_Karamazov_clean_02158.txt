Trifon Borissovitch , recalled , was forced , in spite of his evasions , to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack of cards for the one he had provided , and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game . 
Kalgonov confirmed this , and both the Poles left the witness-box with damaged reputations , amidst laughter from the public . 
Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous witnesses . 
Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them , and dismissing them with a certain derision . 
The lawyers and experts were lost in admiration , and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose could be served by it , for all , I repeat , felt that the case for the prosecution could not be refuted , but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming . 
But from the confidence of the `` great magician '' they saw that he was serene , and they waited , feeling that `` such a man '' had not come from Petersburg for nothing , and that he was not a man to return unsuccessful . 
The Medical Experts and a Pound of Nuts THE evidence of the medical experts , too , was of little use to the prisoner . 
And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much upon it . 
The medical line of defence had only been taken up through the insistence of Katerina Ivanovna , who had sent for a celebrated doctor from Moscow on purpose . 
The case for the defence could , of course , lose nothing by it and might , with luck , gain something from it .
