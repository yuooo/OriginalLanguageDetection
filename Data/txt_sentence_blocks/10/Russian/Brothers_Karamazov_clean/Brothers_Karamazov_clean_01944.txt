Alyosha had a furnished room in the house of some working people . 
Ivan lived some distance from him . 
He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady , the widow of an official . 
But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning . 
Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late , and very fond of being alone . 
He did everything for himself in the one room he lived in , and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode . 
He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell , when he suddenly stopped . 
He felt that he was trembling all over with anger . 
Suddenly he let go of the bell , turned back with a curse , and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction . 
He walked a mile and a half to a tiny , slanting , wooden house , almost a hut , where Marya Kondratyevna , the neighbour who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar , was now lodging .
