Thou art love . 
Thou wilt send joy to all ! '' 
Alyosha murmured , crossing himself , and falling into peaceful sleep . 
Father Ferapont ALYOSHA was roused early , before daybreak . 
Father Zossima woke up feeling very weak , though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair . 
His mind was quite clear ; his face looked very tired , yet bright and almost joyful . 
It wore an expression of gaiety , kindness and cordiality . 
`` Maybe I shall not live through the coming day , '' he said to Alyosha . 
Then he desired to confess and take the sacrament at once . 
He always confessed to Father Paissy .
