Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed . 
`` This is serious , serious , '' she added at every word , as though nothing that had happened to her before had been serious . 
Alyosha listened with distress , and was beginning to describe his adventures , but she interrupted him at the first words . 
She had not time to listen . 
She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there . 
`` Lise , '' she whispered almost in his ear , `` Lise has greatly surprised me just now , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
She touched me , too , and so my heart forgives her everything . 
Only fancy , as soon as you had gone , she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday , though she was not laughing at you , but only joking . 
But she was seriously sorry for it , almost ready to cry , so that I was quite surprised . 
She has never been really sorry for laughing at me , but has only made a joke of it .
