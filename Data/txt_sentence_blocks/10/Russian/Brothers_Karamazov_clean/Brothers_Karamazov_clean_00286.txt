Her gifts to man are friends in need , The wreath , the foaming must , To angels - vision of God 's throne , To insects - sensual lust . 
But enough poetry ! 
I am in tears ; let me cry . 
It may be foolishness that everyone would laugh at . 
But you wo n't laugh . 
Your eyes are shining , too . 
Enough poetry . 
I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gave ` sensual lust . ' 
To insects - sensual lust . 
I am that insect , brother , and it is said of me specially .
