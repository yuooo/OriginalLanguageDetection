She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that .
