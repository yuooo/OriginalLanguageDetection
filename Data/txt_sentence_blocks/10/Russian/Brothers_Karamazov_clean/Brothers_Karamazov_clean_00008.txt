Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously , and was appointed , with Fyodor Pavlovitch , joint guardian of the child , who had a small property , a house and land , left him by his mother . 
Mitya did , in fact , pass into this cousin 's keeping , but as the latter had no family of his own , and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to Paris , he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins , a lady living in Moscow . 
It came to pass that , settling permanently in Paris he , too , forgot the child , especially when the Revolution of February broke out , making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life . 
The Moscow lady died , and Mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters . 
I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on . 
I wo n't enlarge upon that now , as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's firstborn , and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him , without which I could not begin my story . 
In the first place , this Mitya , or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch , was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property , and that he would be independent on coming of age . 
He spent an irregular boyhood and youth . 
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium , he got into a military school , then went to the Caucasus , was promoted , fought a duel , and was degraded to the ranks , earned promotion again , led a wild life , and spent a good deal of money . 
He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age , and until then got into debt .
