`` What am I to say , gentlemen of the jury ? 
The hour of judgment has come for me , I feel the hand of God upon me ! 
The end has come to an erring man ! 
But , before God , I repeat to you , I am innocent of my father 's blood ! 
For the last time I repeat , it was n't I killed him ! 
I was erring , but I loved what is good . 
Every instant I strove to reform , but I lived like a wild beast . 
I thank the prosecutor , he told me many things about myself that I did not know ; but it 's not true that I killed my father , the prosecutor is mistaken . 
I thank my counsel , too . 
I cried listening to him ; but it 's not true that I killed my father , and he need n't have supposed it .
