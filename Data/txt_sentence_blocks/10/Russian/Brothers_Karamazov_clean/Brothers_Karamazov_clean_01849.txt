`` There is some truth in what you say about everyone , '' said Alyosha softly . 
`` Oh , what ideas you have ! '' 
Lise shrieked in delight . 
`` And you a monk , too ! 
You would n't believe how I respect you , Alyosha , for never telling lies . 
Oh , I must tell you a funny dream of mine . 
I sometimes dream of devils . 
It 's night ; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place , in all the corners , under the table , and they open the doors ; there 's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me . 
And they are just coming , just seizing me . 
But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back , though they do n't go away altogether , they stand at the doors and in the corners , waiting .
