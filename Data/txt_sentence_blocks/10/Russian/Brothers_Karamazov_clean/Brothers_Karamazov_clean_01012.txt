And what does it signify that this `` justice '' looked for by Alyosha inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the ashes of his adored teacher ? 
Why , everyone in the monastery cherished the same thought and the same hope , even those whose intellects Alyosha revered , Father Paissy himself , for instance . 
And so Alyosha , untroubled by doubts , clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest . 
And a whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this expectation in his heart . 
But it was justice , justice , he thirsted for , not simply miracles . 
And now the man who should , he believed , have been exalted above everyone in the whole world , that man , instead of receiving the glory that was his due , was suddenly degraded and dishonoured ! 
What for ? 
Who had judged him ? 
Who could have decreed this ? 
Those were the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal heart .
