I said this , though I felt almost dismayed , so greatly was I impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man . 
For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention , no one had come to me before with such a serious , stern , and concentrated expression . 
And now he had come to see me in my own rooms . 
He sat down . 
`` You are , I see , a man of great strength of character '' he said ; `` as you have dared to serve the truth , even when by doing so you risked incurring the contempt of all . '' 
`` Your praise is , perhaps , excessive , '' I replied . 
`` No , it 's not excessive , '' he answered ; `` believe me , such a course of action is far more difficult than you think . 
It is that which has impressed me , and it is only on that account that I have come to you , '' he continued . 
`` Tell me , please , that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps unseemly curiosity , what were your exact sensations , if you can recall them , at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel . 
Do not think my question frivolous ; on the contrary , I have in asking the question a secret motive of my own , which I will perhaps explain to you later on , if it is God 's will that we should become more intimately acquainted . ''
