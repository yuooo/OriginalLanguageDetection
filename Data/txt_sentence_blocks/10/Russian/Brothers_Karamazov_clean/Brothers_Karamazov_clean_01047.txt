I did insult her dreadfully . 
She sent for me , she wanted to make a conquest of me , to win me over with her chocolate ... . 
No , it 's a good thing it did end like that . '' 
She smiled again . 
`` But I am still afraid of your being angry . '' 
`` Yes , that 's really true , '' Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise . 
`` Alyosha , she is really afraid of a chicken like you . '' 
`` He is a chicken to you , Rakitin ... because you 've no conscience , that 's what it is ! 
You see , I love him with all my soul , that 's how it is !
