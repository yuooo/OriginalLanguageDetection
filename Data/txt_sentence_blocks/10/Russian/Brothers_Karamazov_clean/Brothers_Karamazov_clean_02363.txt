The jury deliberated for exactly an hour , neither more nor less . 
A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public had taken their seats . 
I remember how the jurymen walked into the court . 
At last ! 
I wo n't repeat the questions in order , and , indeed , I have forgotten them . 
I remember only the answer to the President 's first and chief question : `` Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of robbery and with premeditation ? '' 
-LRB- I do n't remember the exact words . -RRB- 
There was a complete hush . 
The foreman of the jury , the youngest of the clerks , pronounced , in a clear , loud voice , amidst the deathlike stillness of the court : `` Yes , guilty ! '' 
And the same answer was repeated to every question : `` Yes , guilty ! ''
