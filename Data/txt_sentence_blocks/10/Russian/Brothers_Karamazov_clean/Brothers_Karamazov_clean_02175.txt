Alyosha , carried away himself by his recollection , warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on him , which he might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her , but which he had yet determined not to repay her and to use for another purpose - namely , to enable him to elope with Grushenka , if she consented . 
`` It is so , it must be so , '' exclaimed Alyosha , in sudden excitement . 
`` My brother cried several times that half of the disgrace , half of it -LRB- he said half several times -RRB- he could free himself from at once , but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he would n't do it ... that he knew beforehand he was incapable of doing it ! '' 
`` And you clearly , confidently remember that he struck himself just on this part of the breast ? '' 
Fetyukovitch asked eagerly . 
`` Clearly and confidently , for I thought at the time , ` Why does he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down ? ' 
and the thought seemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed through my mind . 
That 's what brought it back to me just now . 
How could I have forgotten it till now ? 
It was that little bag he meant when he said he had the means but would n't give back that fifteen hundred .
