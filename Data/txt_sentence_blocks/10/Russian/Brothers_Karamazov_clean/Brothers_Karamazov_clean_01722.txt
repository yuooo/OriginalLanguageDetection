I answered with the utmost composure that I had n't egged him on , that I simply stated the general proposition , had spoken hypothetically . 
The justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself once for having smiled . 
` I 'll complain to your masters of you , so that for the future you may n't waste your time on such general propositions , instead of sitting at your books and learning your lessons . ' 
He did n't complain to the masters , that was a joke , but the matter noised abroad and came to the ears of the masters . 
Their ears are long , you know ! 
The classical master , Kolbasnikov , was particularly shocked about it , but Dardanelov got me off again . 
But Kolbasnikov is savage with everyone now like a green ass . 
Did you know , Ilusha , he is just married , got a dowry of a thousand roubles , and his bride 's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree . 
The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it : Astounding news has reached the class , Kolbasnikov has been an ass . 
And so on , awfully funny , I 'll bring it to you later on .
