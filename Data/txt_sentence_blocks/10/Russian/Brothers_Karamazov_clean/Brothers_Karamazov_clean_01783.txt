`` Like a fool , I went round to him just for a minute , on the way to see Mitya , for he is ill , too , my Pole , '' Grushenka began again with nervous haste . 
`` I was laughing , telling Mitya about it . 
` Fancy , ' I said , ` my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar . 
He thought I would be touched and marry him ! ' 
Mitya leapt up swearing ... . 
So , there , I 'll send them the pies ! 
Fenya , is it that little girl they 've sent ? 
Here , give her three roubles and pack up a dozen pies in a paper and tell her to take them . 
And you , Alyosha , be sure to tell Mitya that I did send them the pies . '' 
`` I would n't tell him for anything , '' said Alyosha , smiling .
