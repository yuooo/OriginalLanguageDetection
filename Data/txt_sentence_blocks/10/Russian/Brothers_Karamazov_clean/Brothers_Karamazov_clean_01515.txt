`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? ''
