Ca n't you see it all over his face that he is a fool , that peasant , eh ? '' 
`` Let him alone , Kolya . 
Let 's go on . '' 
`` Nothing could stop me , now I am once off . 
Hey , good morning , peasant ! '' 
A sturdy-looking peasant , with a round , simple face and grizzled beard , who was walking by , raised his head and looked at the boy . 
He seemed not quite sober . 
`` Good morning , if you are not laughing at me , '' he said deliberately in reply . 
`` And if I am ? '' 
laughed Kolya .
