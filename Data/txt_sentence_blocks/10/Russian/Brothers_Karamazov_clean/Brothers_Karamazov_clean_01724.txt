put in Ilusha ; `` he only pretends to be like that , but really he is top in every subject ... '' Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness . 
`` Oh , that 's all nonsense about Troy , a trivial matter . 
I consider this an unimportant question , '' said Kolya with haughty humility . 
He had by now completely recovered his dignity , though he was still a little uneasy . 
He felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose , for instance , with too little reserve , while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word all the time . 
And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him , and thought he was showing off before him . 
If he dared to think anything like that , Kolya would - `` I regard the question as quite a trivial one , '' he rapped out again , proudly . 
`` And I know who founded Troy , '' a boy , who had not spoken before , said suddenly , to the surprise of everyone . 
He was silent and seemed to be shy . 
He was a pretty boy of about eleven , called Kartashov .
