Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt .
