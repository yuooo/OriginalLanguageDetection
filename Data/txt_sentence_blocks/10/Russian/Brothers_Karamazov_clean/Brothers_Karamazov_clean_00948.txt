I went in to him and saw at once , that not only his days , but his hours were numbered . 
He was weak , yellow , his hands trembled , he gasped for breath , but his face was full of tender and happy feeling . 
`` It is done ! '' 
he said . 
`` I 've long been yearning to see you . 
Why did n't you come ? '' 
I did not tell him that they would not let me see him . 
`` God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself . 
I know I am dying , but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years . 
There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do .
