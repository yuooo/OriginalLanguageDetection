`` The doctor has come ! '' 
cried Nina , who had been silent till then . 
A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate . 
The captain , who had been expecting the doctor all the morning , rushed headlong out to meet him . 
`` Mamma '' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air . 
Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight . 
Nina , from her invalid chair , anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy . 
The boys hurriedly took leave . 
Some of them promised to come again in the evening . 
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed .
