I paid no attention to her at all , but all at once , when the minute came , I 'd be all devotion to her , crawl on my knees , kiss her feet , and I always , always - I remember it as though it were to-day - reduced her to that tinkling , quiet , nervous , queer little laugh . 
It was peculiar to her . 
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that . 
The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically , and this little laugh was not a sign of delight , though it made a very good counterfeit . 
That 's the great thing , to know how to take everyone . 
Once Belyavsky - he was a handsome fellow , and rich - used to like to come here and hang about her - suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence . 
And she - such a mild sheep - why , I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow . 
How she set on me ! 
` You 're beaten , beaten now , ' she said , ` You 've taken a blow from him . 
You have been trying to sell me to him , ' she said ... ` And how dared he strike you in my presence !
