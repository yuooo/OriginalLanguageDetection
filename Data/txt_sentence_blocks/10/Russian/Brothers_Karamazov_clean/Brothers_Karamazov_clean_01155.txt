`` Good God , you 've saved me ! 
You have saved a man from a violent death , from a bullet ... . 
My eternal gratitude `` I will give you more , infinitely more than three thousand ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , looking with a radiant smile at Mitya 's ecstasy . 
`` Infinitely ? 
But I do n't need so much . 
I only need that fatal three thousand , and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite gratitude , and I propose a plan which - '' `` Enough , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , it 's said and done . '' 
Madame Hohlakov cut him short , with the modest triumph of beneficence . 
`` I have promised to save you , and I will save you . 
I will save you as I did Belmesov .
