Where is she ? ' 
He looked at me , all of a tremble . 
` Well , ' thought I , ` if he 's so frightened of me as all that , it 's a bad lookout ! ' 
And my legs went weak with fright that he would n't let me in or would call out , or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up , or something else might happen . 
I do n't remember now , but I must have stood pale , facing him . 
I whispered to him , ` Why , she 's there , there , under the window ; how is it you do n't see her ? ' 
I said . 
` Bring her then , bring her . ' 
` She 's afraid , ' said I ; ` she was frightened at the noise , she 's hidden in the bushes ; go and call to her yourself from the study . '
