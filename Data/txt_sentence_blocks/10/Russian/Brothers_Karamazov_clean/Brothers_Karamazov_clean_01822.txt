And no sooner had the second voice said that than I cried out , and fainted . 
Of course , there was a fuss . 
I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin , ` It 's painful for me to say it , but I do n't wish to see you in my house again . ' 
So I turned him out . 
Ah ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , I know myself I did wrong . 
I was putting it on . 
I was n't angry with him at all , really ; but I suddenly fancied - that was what did it - that it would be such a fine scene ... . 
And yet , believe me , it was quite natural , for I really shed tears and cried for several days afterwards , and then suddenly , one afternoon , I forgot all about it . 
So it 's a fortnight since he 's been here , and I kept wondering whether he would come again .
