Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps . 
Fortunately , Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him in time . 
She did not see the fall , but heard his scream - the strange , peculiar scream , long familiar to her - the scream of the epileptic falling in a fit . 
They could not tell whether the fit had come on him at the moment he was decending the steps , so that he must have fallen unconscious , or whether it was the fall and the shock that had caused the fit in Smerdyakov , who was known to be liable to them . 
They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps , writhing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth . 
It was thought at first that he must have broken something - an arm or a leg - and hurt himself , but `` God had preserved him , '' as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it - nothing of the kind had happened . 
But it was difficult to get him out of the cellar . 
They asked the neighbours to help and managed it somehow . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole ceremony . 
He helped , evidently alarmed and upset .
