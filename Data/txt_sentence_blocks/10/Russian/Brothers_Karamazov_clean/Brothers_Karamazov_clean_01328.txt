What have you got there , a great-coat , a fur coat ? 
I 'll bring it out to you . 
They 'll get the horses out directly , and then-good-bye , panie ! '' 
Mitya awaited an answer with assurance . 
He had no doubts . 
An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole 's face . 
`` And the money , panie ? '' 
`` The money , panie ? 
Five hundred roubles I 'll give you this moment for the journey , and as a first instalment , and two thousand five hundred to-morrow , in the town - I swear on my honour , I 'll get it , I 'll get it at any cost ! ''
