`` What does Ivan say ? 
Alyosha , my dear , my only son , I 'm afraid of Ivan . 
I 'm more afraid of Ivan than the other . 
You 're the only one I 'm not afraid of ... '' `` Do n't be afraid of Ivan either . 
He is angry , but he 'll defend you . '' 
`` Alyosha , and what of the other ? 
He 's run to Grushenka . 
My angel , tell me the truth , was she here just now or not ? '' 
`` No one has seen her . 
It was a mistake .
