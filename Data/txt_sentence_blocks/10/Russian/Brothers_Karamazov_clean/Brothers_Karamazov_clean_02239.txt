That motive is jealousy ! '' 
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner 's fatal passion for Grushenka . 
He began from the moment when the prisoner went to the `` young person 's '' lodgings `` to beat her '' - `` I use his own expression , '' the prosecutor explained - `` but instead of beating her , he remained there , at her feet . 
That was the beginning of the passion . 
At the same time the prisoner 's father was captivated by the same young person - a strange and fatal coincidence , for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously , though both had known her before . 
And she inspired in both of them the most violent , characteristically Karamazov passion . 
We have her own confession : ' I was laughing at both of them . ' 
Yes , the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her , and she conquered both of them at once . 
The old man , who worshipped money , at once set aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from her , but soon after that , he would have been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet , if only she would become his lawful wife . 
We have good evidence of this .
