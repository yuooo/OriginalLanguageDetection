But go and get at the truth there , and then come and tell me . 
Anyway it 's easier going to the other world if one knows what there is there . 
Besides , it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here with me , with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you 're like an angel , nothing touches you . 
And I dare say nothing will touch you there . 
That 's why I let you go , because I hope for that . 
You 've got all your wits about you . 
You will burn and you will burn out ; you will be healed and come back again . 
And I will wait for you . 
I feel that you 're the only creature in the world who has not condemned me . 
My dear boy , I feel it , you know .
