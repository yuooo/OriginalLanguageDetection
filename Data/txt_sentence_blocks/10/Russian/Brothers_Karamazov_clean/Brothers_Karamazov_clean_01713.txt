Ilusha will always let you play with it ; it shall belong to both of you , both of you . '' 
`` No , I do n't want it to belong to both of us ; I want it to be mine altogether , not Ilusha 's , '' persisted mamma , on the point of tears . 
`` Take it , mother , here , keep it ! '' 
Ilusha cried . 
`` Krassotkin , may I give it to my mother ? '' 
he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face , as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to someone else . 
`` Of course you may , '' Krassotkin assented heartily , and , taking the cannon from Ilusha , he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow . 
She was so touched that she cried . 
`` Ilusha , darling , he 's the one who loves his mammal '' she said tenderly , and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again . 
`` Mamma , let me kiss your hand . ''
