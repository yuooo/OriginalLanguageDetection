`` An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here ! '' 
cried Dmitri indignantly . 
He too leapt up . 
`` Forgive it , reverend Father , '' he added , addressing the elder . 
`` I am not a cultivated man , and I do n't even know how to address you properly , but you have been deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting us meet here . 
All my father wants is a scandal . 
Why he wants it only he can tell . 
He always has some motive . 
But I believe I know why - '' `` They all blame me , all of them ! '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn .
