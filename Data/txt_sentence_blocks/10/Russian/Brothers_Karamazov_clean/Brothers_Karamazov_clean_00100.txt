It 's three months since I left home . 
I 've forgotten him . 
I 've forgotten everything . 
I do n't want to remember . 
And what would our life be now together ? 
I 've done with him , I 've done . 
I 've done with them all . 
I do n't care to look upon my house and my goods . 
I do n't care to see anything at all ! '' 
`` Listen , mother , '' said the elder .
