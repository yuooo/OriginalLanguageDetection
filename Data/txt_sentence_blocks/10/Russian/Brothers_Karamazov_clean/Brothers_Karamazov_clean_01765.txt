`` Father , father , come ... we ... '' Ilusha faltered in violent excitement , but apparently unable to go on , he flung his wasted arms , found his father and Kolya , uniting them in one embrace , and hugging them as tightly as he could . 
The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs , and Kolya 's lips and chin twitched . 
`` Father , father ! 
How sorry I am for you ! '' 
Ilusha moaned bitterly . 
`` Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we shall be happy ... the doctor ... '' the captain began . 
`` Ah , father ! 
I know what the new doctor said to you about me ... . 
I saw ! '' 
cried Ilusha , and again he hugged them both with all his strength , hiding his face on his father 's shoulder .
