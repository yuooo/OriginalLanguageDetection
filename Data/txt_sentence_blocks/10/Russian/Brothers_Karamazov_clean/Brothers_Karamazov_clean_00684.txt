`` I do n't like your brother Ivan , Alyosha , '' said Lise suddenly . 
He noticed this remark with some surprise , but did not answer it . 
`` My brothers are destroying themselves , '' he went on , `` my father , too . 
And they are destroying others with them . 
It 's ` the primitive force of the Karamazovs , ' as father Paissy said the other day , a crude , unbridled , earthly force . 
Does the spirit of God move above that force ? 
Even that I do n't know . 
I only know that I , too , am a Karamazov ... . 
Me a monk , a monk ! 
Am I a monk , Lise ?
