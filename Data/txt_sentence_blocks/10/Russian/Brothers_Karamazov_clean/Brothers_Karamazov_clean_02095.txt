It 's that , that we must begin with . 
Oh , blind race of men who have no understanding ! 
As soon as men have all of them denied God - and I believe that period , analogous with geological periods , will come to pass - the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism , and , what 's more , the old morality , and everything will begin anew . 
Men will unite to take from life all it can give , but only for joy and happiness in the present world . 
Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear . 
From hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science , man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven . 
Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god . 
His pride will teach him that it 's useless for him to repine at life 's being a moment , and he will love his brother without need of reward . 
Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life , but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire , which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave ' ... and so on and so on in the same style . 
Charming ! ''
