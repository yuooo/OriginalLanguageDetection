`` Listen . 
There are a lot of questions I want to ask you , but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up . 
Yes . 
Tell me this at least , why did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor ? 
Why did n't you simply carry off the envelope ? 
... When you were telling me , I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right thing to do ... but why , I ca n't understand ... '' `` I did that for a good reason . 
For if a man had known all about it , as I did for instance , if he 'd seen those notes before , and perhaps had put them in that envelope himself , and had seen the envelope sealed up and addressed , with his own eyes , if such a man had done the murder , what should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards , especially in such desperate haste , since he 'd know for certain the notes must be in the envelope ? 
No , if the robber had been someone like me , he 'd simply have put the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could . 
But it 'd be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
He only knew about the envelope by hearsay ; he had never seen it , and if he 'd found it , for instance , under the mattress , he 'd have torn it open as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were in it .
