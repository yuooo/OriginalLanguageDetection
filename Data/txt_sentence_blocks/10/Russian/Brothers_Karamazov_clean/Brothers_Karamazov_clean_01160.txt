`` Here ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , running back joyfully to Mitya , `` here is what I was looking for ! '' 
It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord , such as is sometimes worn next the skin with a cross . 
`` This is from Kiev , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' she went on reverently , `` from the relics of the Holy Martyr , Varvara . 
Let me put it on your neck myself , and with it dedicate you to a new life , to a new career . '' 
And she actually put the cord round his neck , and began arranging it . 
In extreme embarrassment , Mitya bent down and helped her , and at last he got it under his neck-tie and collar through his shirt to his chest . 
`` Now you can set off , '' Madame Hohlakov pronounced , sitting down triumphantly in her place again . 
`` Madam , I am so touched . 
I do n't know how to thank you , indeed ... for such kindness , but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me ... .
