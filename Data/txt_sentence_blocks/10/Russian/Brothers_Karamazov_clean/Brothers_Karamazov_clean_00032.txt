That 's a dowry for you . 
And I 'll never desert you , my angel . 
And I 'll pay what 's wanted for you there , if they ask for it . 
But , of course , if they do n't ask , why should we worry them ? 
What do you say ? 
You know , you spend money like a canary , two grains a week . 
H 'm ! 
... Do you know that near one monastery there 's a place outside the town where every baby knows there are none but ` the monks ' wives ' living , as they are called . 
Thirty women , I believe . 
I have been there myself .
