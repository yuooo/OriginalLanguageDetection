Kolya smiled mysteriously . 
`` Listen , Karamazov , I 'll tell you all about it . 
That 's what I came for ; that 's what I asked you to come out here for , to explain the whole episode to you before we go in , '' he began with animation . 
`` You see , Karamazov , Ilusha came into the preparatory class last spring . 
Well , you know what our preparatory class is - a lot of small boys . 
They began teasing Ilusha at once . 
I am two classes higher up , and , of course , I only look on at them from a distance . 
I saw the boy was weak and small , but he would n't give in to them ; he fought with them . 
I saw he was proud , and his eyes were full of fire . 
I like children like that .
