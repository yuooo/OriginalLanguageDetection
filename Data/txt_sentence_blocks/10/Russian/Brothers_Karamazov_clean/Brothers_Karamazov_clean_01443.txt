At that moment another unexpected scene followed . 
Though Grushenka had been removed , she had not been taken far away , only into the room next but one from the blue room , in which the examination was proceeding . 
It was a little room with one window , next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted so lavishly . 
She was sitting there with no one by her but Maximov , who was terribly depressed , terribly scared , and clung to her side , as though for security . 
At their door stood one of the peasants with a metal plate on his breast . 
Grushenka was crying , and suddenly her grief was too much for her , she jumped up , flung up her arms and , with a loud wail of sorrow , rushed out of the room to him , to her Mitya , and so unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her . 
Mitya , hearing her cry , trembled , jumped up , and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her , not knowing what he was doing . 
But they were not allowed to come together , though they saw one another . 
He was seized by the arms . 
He struggled , and tried to tear himself away .
