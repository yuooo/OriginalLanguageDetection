Kolya scanned him gravely . 
`` Have you been to the Church of the Ascension ? '' 
he suddenly asked him , with stern emphasis . 
`` What Church of Ascension ? 
What for ? 
No , I have n't , '' said the young man , somewhat taken aback . 
`` Do you know Sabaneyev ? '' 
Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely . 
`` What Sabaneyev ? 
No , I do n't know him . ''
