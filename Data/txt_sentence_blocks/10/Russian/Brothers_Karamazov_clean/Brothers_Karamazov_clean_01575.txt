They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning ; three and three made six , three thousand then and three now made six , that was clear . 
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch , Stepan and Semyon , the driver Andrey , and Kalganov . 
The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch 's evidence . 
They noted down , with particular care , Andrey 's account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road : '' ` Where , ' says he , ` am I , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , going , to heaven or to hell , and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not ? ' '' 
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile , and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be `` included in the case . '' 
Kalganov , when called , came in reluctantly , frowning and ill-humoured , and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his life , though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day for a long time past . 
He began by saying that `` he knew nothing about it and did n't want to . '' 
But it appeared that he had heard of the '' sixth '' thousand , and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the moment . 
As far as he could see he `` did n't know '' how much money Mitya had in his hands . 
He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards .
