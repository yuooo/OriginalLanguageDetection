Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense , not expressly for Ilusha , but for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter . 
But , as he had come , she had asked him to see Ilusha as well , and the captain had been told to expect him . 
He had n't the slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming , though he had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting . 
At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room , the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha 's bed , looking at a tiny mastiff pup , which had only been born the day before , though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha , who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka . 
Ilusha , who had heard three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy , not an ordinary puppy , but a pedigree mastiff -LRB- a very important point , of course -RRB- , tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased . 
But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had killed . 
The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he , smiling sadly , stroked it with his thin , pale , wasted hand . 
Clearly he liked the puppy , but ... it was n't Zhutchka ; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy , too , then he would have been completely happy . 
`` Krassotkin ! '' 
cried one of the boys suddenly .
