If there 's no ceiling there can be no hooks , and if there are no hooks it all breaks down , which is unlikely again , for then there would be none to drag me down to hell , and if they do n't drag me down what justice is there in the world ? 
Il faudrait les inventer , * those hooks , on purpose for me alone , for , if you only knew , Alyosha , what a black-guard I am . '' 
* It would be neccessary to invent them . 
`` But there are no hooks there , '' said Alyosha , looking gently and seriously at his father . 
`` Yes , yes , only the shadows of hooks . 
I know , I know .

* How do you know there are no hooks , darling ? 
When you 've lived with the monks you 'll sing a different tune .
