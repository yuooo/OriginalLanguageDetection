`` I did think so , '' answered Alyosha , softly . 
`` It was so , too ; it was not a matter of guessing . 
But did n't you fancy then that what I wished was just that one reptile should devour another ' ; that is , just that Dmitri should kill father , and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about ? '' 
Alyosha turned rather pale , and looked silently into his brother 's face . 
`` Speak ! '' 
cried Ivan , `` I want above everything to know what you thought then . 
I want the truth , the truth ! '' 
He drew a deep breath , looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came . 
`` Forgive me , I did think that , too , at the time , '' whispered Alyosha , and he did not add one softening phrase . 
`` Thanks , '' snapped Ivan , and , leaving Alyosha , he went quickly on his way .
