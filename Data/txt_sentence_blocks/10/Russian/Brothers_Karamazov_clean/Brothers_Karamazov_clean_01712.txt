Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha , together with the powder and the shot . 
`` I got it for you , for you ! 
I 've been keeping it for you a long time , '' he repeated once more in his delight . 
`` Oh , give it to me ! 
No , give me the cannon ! '' 
mamma began begging like a little child . 
Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it . 
Kolya was disconcerted . 
The captain fidgeted uneasily . 
`` Mamma , mamma , '' he ran to her , `` the cannon 's yours , of course , but let Ilusha have it , because it 's a present to him , but it 's just as good as yours .
