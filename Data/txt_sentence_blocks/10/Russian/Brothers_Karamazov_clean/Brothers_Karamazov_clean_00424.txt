I believe you . 
I 'll tell you what it is : you go to Grushenka yourself , or see her somehow ; make haste and ask her ; see for yourself , which she means to choose , him or me . 
Eh ? 
What ? 
Can you ? '' 
`` If I see her I 'll ask her , '' Alyosha muttered , embarrassed . 
`` No , she wo n't tell you , '' the old man interrupted , `` she 's a rogue . 
She 'll begin kissing you and say that it 's you she wants . 
She 's a deceitful , shameless hussy . 
You must n't go to her , you must n't ! ''
