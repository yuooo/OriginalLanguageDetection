`` Yes , I shall be told , but he was carousing that night , squandering money ; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles - where did he get the money ? 
But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found , and the other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered , shows that that money was not the same , and had never been in any envelope . 
By strict calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin 's without going home , and that he had been nowhere . 
So he had been all the time in company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and hidden half in the town . 
It 's just this consideration that has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe . 
Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho , gentlemen ? 
Is n't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic ? 
And observe , if that supposition breaks down , the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds , for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles ? 
By what miracle could they have disappeared , since it 's proved the prisoner went nowhere else ? 
And we are ready to ruin a man 's life with such tales !
