The only person who saw them , and stated that they had been put in the envelope , was the servant , Smerdyakov . 
He had spoken of it to the prisoner and his brother , Ivan Fyodorovitch , before the catastrophe . 
Madame Svyetlov , too , had been told of it . 
But not one of these three persons had actually seen the notes , no one but Smerdyakov had seen them . 
`` Here the question arises , if it 's true that they did exist , and that Smerdyakov had seen them , when did he see them for the last time ? 
What if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his cash-box without telling him ? 
Note , that according to Smerdyakov 's story the notes were kept under the mattress ; the prisoner must have pulled them out , and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled ; that is carefully recorded in the protocol . 
How could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the bed ? 
How could he have helped soiling with his blood-stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely made ? 
`` But I shall be asked : What about the envelope on the floor ?
