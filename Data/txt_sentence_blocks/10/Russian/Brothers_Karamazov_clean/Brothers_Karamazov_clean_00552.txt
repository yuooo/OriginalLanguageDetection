`` Ah , your caprices , Lise , your fidgetiness , your illness , that awful night of fever , that awful everlasting Herzenstube , everlasting , everlasting , that 's the worst of it ! 
Everything , in fact , everything ... . 
Even that miracle , too ! 
Oh , how it has upset me , how it has shattered me , that miracle , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
And that tragedy in the drawing-room , it 's more than I can bear , I warn you . 
I ca n't bear it . 
A comedy , perhaps , not a tragedy . 
Tell me , will Father Zossima live till to-morrow , will he ? 
Oh , my God ! 
What is happening to me ?
