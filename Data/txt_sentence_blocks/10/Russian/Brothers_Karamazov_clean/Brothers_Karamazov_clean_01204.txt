Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience . 
`` I say , let him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close , and you go and tell them ... . 
Give him your note . 
Be off , Misha ! 
Put your best leg forward ! '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose , because the boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open , apparently understanding little of Mitya 's orders , gazing up with amazement and terror at his bloodstained face and the trembling blood-stained fingers that held the notes . 
`` Well , now come and wash , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly . 
`` Put the money on the table or else in your pocket ... . 
That 's right , come along . 
But take off your coat . ''
