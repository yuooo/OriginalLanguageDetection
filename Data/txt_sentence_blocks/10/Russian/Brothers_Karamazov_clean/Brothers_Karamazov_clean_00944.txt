We sat still for two minutes ; he looked intently at me and suddenly smiled . 
I remembered that - then he got up , embraced me warmly and kissed me . 
`` Remember , '' he said , `` how I came to you a second time . 
Do you hear , remember it ! '' 
And he went out . 
`` To-morrow , '' I thought . 
And so it was . 
I did not know that evening that the next day was his birthday . 
I had not been out for the last few days , so I had no chance of hearing it from anyone . 
On that day he always had a great gathering , everyone in the town went to it .
