What do you mean ? '' 
answered Kalgonov suddenly . 
`` Sit down with us . 
How are you ? '' 
`` Delighted to see you , dear ... and precious fellow , I always thought a lot of you . '' 
Mitya responded , joyfully and eagerly , at once holding out his hand across the table . 
`` Aie ! 
How tight you squeeze ! 
You 've quite broken my fingers , '' laughed Kalganov . 
`` He always squeezes like that , always , '' Grushenka put in gaily , with a timid smile , seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya 's face that he was not going to make a scene .
