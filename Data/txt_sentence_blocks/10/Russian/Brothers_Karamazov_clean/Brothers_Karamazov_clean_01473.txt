Clearly , precisely , distinctly , he described the feelings that troubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was with his father or not . 
But , strange to say , both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve , looked coldly at him , asked few questions . 
Mitya could gather nothing from their faces . 
`` They 're angry and offended , '' he thought . 
`` Well , bother them ! '' 
When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the `` signal '' to his father that Grushenka had come , so that he should open the window , the lawyers paid no attention to the word `` signal , '' as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection : so much so , that Mitya noticed it . 
Coming at last to the moment when , seeing his father peering out of the window , his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket , he suddenly , as though of design , stopped short . 
He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the investigating lawyer .
