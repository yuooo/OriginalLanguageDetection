And it was the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man . 
The sight of the rainbow-coloured notes may have made a morbid impression on his imagination , but with no immediate results . 
`` The talented prosecutor , with extraordinary subtlety , sketched for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov 's guilt , and asked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit . 
But he may not have been feigning at all , the fit may have happened quite naturally , but it may have passed off quite naturally , and the sick man may have recovered , not completely perhaps , but still regaining consciousness , as happens with epileptics . 
`` The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the murder . 
But it is very easy to point out that moment . 
He might have waked up from deep sleep -LRB- for he was only asleep - an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep -RRB- at that moment when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his voice ` Parricide ! ' 
That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment : he might naturally have waked up an hour before . 
`` Getting out of bed , he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite motive towards the sound to see what 's the matter . 
His head is still clouded with his attack , his faculties are half asleep ; but , once in the garden , he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from his master , who would be , of course , glad to see him .
