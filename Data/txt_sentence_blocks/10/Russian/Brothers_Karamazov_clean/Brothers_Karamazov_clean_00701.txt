`` But he said I was a stinking lackey . 
He thinks that I might be unruly . 
He is mistaken there . 
If I had a certain sum in my pocket , I would have left here long ago . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his behaviour , in his mind , and in his poverty . 
He does n't know how to do anything , and yet he is respected by everyone . 
I may be only a soup-maker , but with luck I could open a cafe restaurant in Petrovka , in Moscow , for my cookery is something special , and there 's no one in Moscow , except the foreigners , whose cookery is anything special . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar , but if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country , he 'd fight him . 
Though in what way is he better than I am ? 
For he is ever so much stupider than I am .
