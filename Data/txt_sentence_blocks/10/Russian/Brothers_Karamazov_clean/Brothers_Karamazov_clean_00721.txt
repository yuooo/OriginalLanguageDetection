Have you seen Dmitri to-day ? '' 
`` No , but I saw Smerdyakov , '' and Alyosha rapidly , though minutely , described his meeting with Smerdyakov . 
Ivan began listening anxiously and questioned him . 
`` But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him , '' added Alyosha . 
Ivan frowned and pondered . 
`` Are you frowning on Smerdyakov 's account ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , on his account . 
Damn him , I certainly did want to see Dmitri , but now there 's no need , '' said Ivan reluctantly . 
`` But are you really going so soon , brother ? ''
