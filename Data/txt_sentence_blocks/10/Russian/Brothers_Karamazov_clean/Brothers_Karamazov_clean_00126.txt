`` Oh , how you speak ! 
What bold and lofty words '' cried the lady . 
`` You seem to pierce with your words . 
And yet - happiness , happiness - where is it ? 
Who can say of himself that he is happy ? 
Oh , since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day , let me tell you what I could not utter last time , what I dared not say , all I am suffering and have been for so long ! 
I am suffering ! 
Forgive me ! 
I am suffering ! '' 
And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him .
