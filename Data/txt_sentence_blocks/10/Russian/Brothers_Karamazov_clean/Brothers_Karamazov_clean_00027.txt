Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his second wife was buried , for he had never visited her grave since he had thrown earth upon her coffin , and in the course of years had entirely forgotten where she was buried . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch , by the way , had for some time previously not been living in our town . 
Three or four years after his wife 's death he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa , where he spent several years . 
He made the acquaintance at first , in his own words , `` of a lot of low Jews , Jewesses , and Jewkins , '' and ended by being received by `` Jews high and low alike . '' 
It may be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money . 
He finally returned to our town only three years before Alyosha 's arrival . 
His former acquaintances found him looking terribly aged , although he was by no means an old man . 
He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more effrontery . 
The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making buffoons of others . 
His depravity with women was not as it used to be , but even more revolting .
