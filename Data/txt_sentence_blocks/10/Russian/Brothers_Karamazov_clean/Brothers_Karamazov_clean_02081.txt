`` That anecdote about the quadrillion years , I made up myself ! 
I was seventeen then , I was at the high school . 
I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin , it was at Moscow ... . 
The anecdote is so characteristic that I could n't have taken it from anywhere . 
I thought I 'd forgotten it ... but I 've unconsciously recalled it - I recalled it myself - it was not you telling it ! 
Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that even when people are being taken to execution ... it 's come back to me in a dream . 
You are that dream ! 
You are a dream , not a living creature ! '' 
`` From the vehemence with which you deny my existence , '' laughed the gentleman , `` I am convinced that you believe in me . '' 
`` Not in the slightest !
