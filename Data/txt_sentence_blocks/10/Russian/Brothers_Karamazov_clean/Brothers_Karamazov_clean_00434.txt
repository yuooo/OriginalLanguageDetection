There were pictures on the walls , vases and lamps on the tables , masses of flowers , and even an aquarium in the window . 
It was twilight and rather dark . 
Alyosha made out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa , where people had evidently just been sitting ; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate , cakes , a glass saucer with blue raisins , and another with sweetmeats . 
Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors , and frowned . 
But at that instant the portiere was raised , and with rapid , hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in , holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight . 
At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table . 
`` Thank God ! 
At last you have come too ! 
I 've been simply praying for you all day ! 
Sit down . ''
