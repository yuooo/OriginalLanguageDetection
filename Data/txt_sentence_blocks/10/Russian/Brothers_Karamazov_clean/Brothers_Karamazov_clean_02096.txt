Ivan sat with his eyes on the floor , and his hands pressed to his ears , but he began trembling all over . 
The voice continued . 
`` The question now is , my young thinker reflected , is it possible that such a period will ever come ? 
If it does , everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever . 
But as , owing to man 's inveterate stupidity , this can not come about for at least a thousand years , everyone who recognises the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases , on the new principles . 
In that sense , ` all things are lawful ' for him . 
What 's more , even if this period never comes to pass , since there is anyway no God and no immortality , the new man may well become the man-god , even if he is the only one in the whole world , and promoted to his new position , he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slaveman , if necessary . 
There is no law for God . 
Where God stands , the place is holy . 
Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ... ` all things are lawful ' and that 's the end of it !
