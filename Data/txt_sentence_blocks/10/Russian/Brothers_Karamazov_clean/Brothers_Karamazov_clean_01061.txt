How has he shown it , that you make such a fuss about it ? '' 
Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room ; she spoke with heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice . 
`` Hush , Rakitin , you know nothing about us !

And now , Alyosha , I 'll tell you the whole truth , that you may see what a wretch I am ! 
I am not talking to Rakitin , but to you . 
I wanted to ruin you , Alyosha , that 's the holy truth ; I quite meant to .
