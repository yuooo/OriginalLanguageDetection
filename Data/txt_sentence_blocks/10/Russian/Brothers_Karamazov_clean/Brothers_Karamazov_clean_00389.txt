`` It 's a pity . 
Damn it all , what would n't I do to the man who first invented God ! 
Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for , him . '' 
`` There would have been no civilisation if they had n't invented God . '' 
`` Would n't there have been ? 
Without God ? '' 
`` No . 
And there would have been no brandy either . 
But I must take your brandy away from you , anyway . ''
