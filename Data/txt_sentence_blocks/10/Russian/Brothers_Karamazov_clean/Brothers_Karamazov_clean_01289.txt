`` Polish women ? '' 
repeated Mitya , perfectly ecstatic . 
Kalgonov was well aware of Mitya 's attitude to Grushenka , and he guessed about the Pole , too , but that did not so much interest him , perhaps did not interest him at all ; what he was interested in was Maximov . 
He had come here with Maximov by chance , and he met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in his life . 
Grushenka he knew before , and had once been with someone to see her ; but she had not taken to him . 
But here she looked at him very affectionately : before Mitya 's arrival , she had been making much of him , but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it . 
He was a boy , not over twenty , dressed like a dandy , with a very charming fair-skinned face , and splendid thick , fair hair . 
From his fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes , with an intelligent and sometimes even deep expression , beyond his age indeed , although the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child , and was not at all ashamed of it , even when he was aware of it himself . 
As a rule he was very wilful , even capricious , though always friendly . 
Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his expression .
