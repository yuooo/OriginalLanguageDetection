And what is suffering ? 
I am not afraid of it , even if it were beyond reckoning . 
I am not afraid of it now . 
I was afraid of it before . 
Do you know , perhaps I wo n't answer at the trial at all ... . 
And I seem to have such strength in me now , that I think I could stand anything , any suffering , only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment , ' I exist . ' 
In thousands of agonies - I exist . 
I 'm tormented on the rack - but I exist ! 
Though I sit alone on a pillar - I exist ! 
I see the sun , and if I do n't see the sun , I know it 's there .
