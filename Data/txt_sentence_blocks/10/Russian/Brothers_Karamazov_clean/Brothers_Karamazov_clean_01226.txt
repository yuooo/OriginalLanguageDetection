`` Fifty roubles for vodka if we 're only an hour behind them . '' 
`` I warrant the time , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
Ech , they wo n't be half an hour before us , let alone an hour . '' 
Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things , he gave his orders strangely , as it were , disconnectedly , and inconsecutively . 
He began a sentence and forgot the end of it .

`` Four hundred roubles ' worth , not less than four hundred roubles ' worth , just as it was then , '' commanded Mitya .
