Yet I must give some preliminary account of him , if only to explain one queer fact , which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice . 
Yes , he had been for the last year in our monastery , and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest of his life . 
The Third Son , Alyosha HE was only twenty , his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at the time , while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven . 
First of all , I must explain that this young man , Alyosha , was not a fanatic , and , in my opinion at least , was not even a mystic . 
I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning . 
He was simply an early lover of humanity , and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him , so to say , as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love . 
And the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time , as he thought an extrordinary being , our celebrated elder , Zossima , to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart . 
But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that time , and had been so indeed from his cradle . 
I have mentioned already , by the way , that though he lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life her face , her caresses , `` as though she stood living before me . '' 
Such memories may persist , as everyone knows , from an even earlier age , even from two years old , but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out of darkness , like a corner torn out of a huge picture , which has all faded and disappeared except that fragment .
