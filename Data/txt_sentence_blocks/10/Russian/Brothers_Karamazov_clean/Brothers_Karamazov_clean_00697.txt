`` Poetry is rubbish ! '' 
said Smerdyakov curtly . 
`` Oh , no ! 
I am very fond of poetry . '' 
`` So far as it 's poetry , it 's essential rubbish . 
Consider yourself , who ever talks in rhyme ? 
And if we were all to talk in rhyme , even though it were decreed by government , we should n't say much , should we ? 
Poetry is no good , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` How clever you are ! 
How is it you 've gone so deep into everything ? ''
