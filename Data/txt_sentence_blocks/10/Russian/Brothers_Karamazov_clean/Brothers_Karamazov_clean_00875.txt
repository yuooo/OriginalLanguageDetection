I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though his whole future were expressed in his eyes . 
A look came into his eyes - so that I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing for himself . 
Once or twice in my life I 've seen such a look in a man 's face ... reflecting as it were his future fate , and that fate , alas , came to pass . 
I sent you to him , Alexey , for I thought your brotherly face would help him . 
But everything and all our fates are from the Lord . 
` Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone ; but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . ' 
Remember that . 
You , Alexey , I 've many times silently blessed for your face , know that , '' added the elder with a gentle smile . 
`` This is what I think of you , you will go forth from these walls , but will live like a monk in the world . 
You will have many enemies , but even your foes will love you .
