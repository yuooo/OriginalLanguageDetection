He gathered loose women into his house , and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife 's presence . 
To show what a pass things had come to , I may mention that Grigory , the gloomy , stupid , obstinate , argumentative servant , who had always hated his first mistress , Adelaida Ivanovna , took the side of his new mistress . 
He championed her cause , abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant , and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house . 
In the end this unhappy young woman , kept in terror from her childhood , fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be `` possessed by devils . '' 
At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason . 
Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons , Ivan and Alexey , the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later . 
When she died , little Alexey was in his fourth year , and , strange as it seems , I know that he remembered his mother all his life , like a dream , of course . 
At her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother , Mitya . 
They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father . 
They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage , where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother .
