`` Yes , yes . 
I was telling lies just now . 
I was lying against my honour and my conscience , but I wanted to save him , for he has hated and despised me so ! '' 
Katya cried madly . 
`` Oh , he has despised me horribly , he has always despised me , and do you know , he has despised me from the very moment that I bowed down to him for that money . 
I saw that ... . 
I felt it at once at the time , but for a long time I would n't believe it . 
How often I have read it in his eyes , ` You came of yourself , though . ' 
Oh , he did n't understand , he had no idea why I ran to him , he can suspect nothing but baseness , he judged me by himself , he thought everyone was like himself ! '' 
Katya hissed furiously , in a perfect frenzy .
