`` You are not a fool , '' said Ivan , seeming struck . 
The blood rushed to his face . 
`` You are serious now ! '' 
he observed , looking suddenly at Smerdyakov with a different expression . 
`` It was your pride made you think I was a fool . 
Take the money . '' 
Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without wrapping them in anything . 
`` I shall show them at the court to-morrow , '' he said . 
`` Nobody will believe you , as you 've plenty of money of your own ; you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court . ''
