` No Ilusha , ' said I , ' I would not take money from him for anything . ' 
he began trembling all over , took my hand in both his and kissed it again . 
` Father , ' he said , ` father , challenge him to a duel , at school they say you are a coward and wo n't challenge him , and that you 'll accept ten roubles from him . ' ' 
I ca n't challenge him to a duel , Ilusha , ' I answered . 
And I told briefly what I 've just told you . 
He listened . 
` Father , ' he said , anyway do n't forgive it . 
When I grow up I 'll call him out myself and kill him . ' 
His eyes shone and glowed . 
And of course I am his father , and I had to put in a word : ` It 's a sin to kill , ' I said , ` even in a duel . '
