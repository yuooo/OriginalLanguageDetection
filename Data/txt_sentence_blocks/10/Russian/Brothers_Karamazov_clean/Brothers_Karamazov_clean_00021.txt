That is how it was with him . 
He remembered one still summer evening , an open window , the slanting rays of the setting sun -LRB- that he recalled most vividly of all -RRB- ; in a corner of the room the holy image , before it a lighted lamp , and on her knees before the image his mother , sobbing hysterically with cries and moans , snatching him up in both arms , squeezing him close till it hurt , and praying for him to the Mother of God , holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put him under the Mother 's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror . 
That was the picture ! 
And Alyosha remembered his mother 's face at that minute . 
He used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered . 
But he rarely cared to speak of this memory to anyone . 
In his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive , and talked little indeed , but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability ; quite the contrary , from something different , from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people , but so important to him that he seemed , as it were , to forget others on account of it . 
But he was fond of people : he seemed throughout his life to put implicit trust in people : yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton or naive person . 
There was something about him which made one feel at once -LRB- and it was so all his life afterwards -RRB- that he did not care to be a judge of others that he would never take it upon himself to criticise and would never condemn anyone for anything . 
He seemed , indeed , to accept everything without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly : and this was so much so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth .
