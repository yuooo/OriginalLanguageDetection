`` I say this in case we become bad , '' Alyosha went on , `` but there 's no reason why we should become bad , is there , boys ? 
Let us be , first and above all , kind , then honest and then let us never forget each other ! 
I say that again . 
I give you my word for my part that I 'll never forget one of you . 
Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty years . 
Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not . 
But I can not forget that Kartashov exists and that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of Troy , but is looking at me with his jolly , kind , dear little eyes . 
Boys , my dear boys , let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha , clever , brave and generous like Kolya -LRB- though he will be ever so much cleverer when he is grown up -RRB- , and let us all be as modest , as clever and sweet as Kartashov . 
But why am I talking about those two ? 
You are all dear to me , boys ; from this day forth , I have a place in my heart for you all , and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me !
