asked Father Ferapont , suddenly . 
`` Mushrooms ? '' 
repeated the surprised monk . 
`` Yes . 
I can give up their bread , not needing it at all , and go away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries , but they ca n't give up their bread here , wherefore they are in bondage to the devil . 
Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting . 
Haughty and unclean is their judgment . '' 
`` Och , true , '' sighed the monk . 
`` And have you seen devils among them ? '' 
asked Ferapont .
