And I am told that his son , a boy , quite a child , who is at the school here , saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for his father , appealing to everyone to defend him , while everyone laughed . 
You must forgive me , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I can not think without indignation of that disgraceful action of his ... one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger ... and in his passions ! 
I ca n't describe it even ... . 
I ca n't find my words . 
I 've made inquiries about his victim , and find he is quite a poor man . 
His name is Snegiryov . 
He did something wrong in the army and was discharged . 
I ca n't tell you what . 
And now he has sunk into terrible destitution , with his family - an unhappy family of sick children , and , I believe , an insane wife . 
He has been living here a long time ; he used to work as a copying clerk , but now he is getting nothing .
