I say to Nikita , my husband , ` let me go on a pilgrimage , master . ' 
He is a driver . 
We 're not poor people , Father , not poor ; he drives our own horse . 
It 's all our own , the horse and the carriage . 
And what good is it all to us now ? 
My Nikita has begun drinking while I am away . 
He 's sure to . 
It used to be so before . 
As soon as I turn my back he gives way to it . 
But now I do n't think about him .
