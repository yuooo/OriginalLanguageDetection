He 'll be drunk , you know . '' 
`` Perhaps he will . 
Let us come together , you and I , that will be enough , to spend an hour with them , with the mother and Nina . 
If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again , '' Alyosha suggested . 
`` The landlady is laying the table for them now - there 'll be a funeral dinner or something , the priest is coming ; shall we go back to it , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Of course , '' said Alyosha . 
`` It 's all so strange , Karamazov , such sorrow and then pancakes after it , it all seems so unnatural in our religion . '' 
`` They are going to have salmon , too , '' the boy who had discovered about Troy observed in a loud voice . 
`` I beg you most earnestly , Kartashov , not to interrupt again with your idiotic remarks , especially when one is not talking to you and does n't care to know whether you exist or not ! '' 
Kolya snapped out irritably .
