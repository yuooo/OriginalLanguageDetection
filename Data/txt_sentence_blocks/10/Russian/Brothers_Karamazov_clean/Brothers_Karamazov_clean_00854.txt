Sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he is doing it . 
He told me the year before last that his wife was dead and that he had married another , and would you believe it , there was not a word of truth in it ? 
His wife has never died at all , she is alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week .

`` I shall be no use in such a business . 
I have no eye either . '' 
`` Stay , wait a bit ! 
You will be of use , for I will tell you the signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin . 
I 've done business with him a long time .
