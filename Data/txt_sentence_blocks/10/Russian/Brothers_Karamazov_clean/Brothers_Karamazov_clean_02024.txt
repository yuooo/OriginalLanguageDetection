That I persuaded you to go to Tcherinashnya ? 
That 's all nonsense . 
Besides , after our conversation you would either have gone away or have stayed . 
If you had stayed , nothing would have happened . 
I should have known that you did n't want it done , and should have attempted nothing . 
As you went away , it meant you assured me that you would n't dare to inform against me at the trial , and that you 'd overlook my having the three thousand . 
And , indeed , you could n't have prosecuted me afterwards , because then I should have told it all in the court ; that is , not that I had stolen the money or killed him - I should n't have said that - but that you 'd put me up to the theft and the murder , though I did n't consent to it . 
That 's why I needed your consent , so that you could n't have cornered me afterwards , for what proof could you have had ? 
I could always have cornered you , revealing your eagerness for your father 's death , and I tell you the public would have believed it all , and you would have been ashamed for the rest of your life . '' 
`` Was I then so eager , was I ? ''
