After he had ceased to visit her , he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through the garden by the roof , at great risk of discovery . 
But , as often happens , a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than others . 
Entering the garret through the skylight , he went down the ladder , knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes , through the negligence of the servants , left unlocked .

Then with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall on the servants .
