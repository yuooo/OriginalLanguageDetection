`` What should I forgive you for , sir ? 
You 've never done me any harm . '' 
`` No , for everyone , for everyone , you here alone , on the road , will you forgive me for everyone ? 
Speak , simple peasant heart ! '' 
`` Oh , sir ! 
I feel afraid of driving you , your talk is so strange . '' 
But Mitya did not hear . 
He was frantically praying and muttering to himself . 
`` Lord , receive me , with all my lawlessness , and do not condemn me . 
Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me , for I have condemned myself , do not condemn me , for I love Thee , O Lord .
