I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way , for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses . 
I had a presentiment of it ; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in . 
I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and did n't say who was the author . 
But I am convinced that he guessed , though he wo n't own it to this day , and declares he had no idea . 
But he says that on purpose . 
Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once , and fell to criticising it . 
` Wretched doggerel , ' he said they were , ` some divinity student must have written them , ' and with such vehemence , such vehemence ! 
Then , instead of laughing , your friend flew into a rage . 
` Good gracious ! ' 
I thought , ` they 'll fly at each other . '
