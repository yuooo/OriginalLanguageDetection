It was a late Easter , and the days were bright , fine , and full of fragrance . 
I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly , but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair . 
That 's how I remember him sitting , sweet and gentle , smiling , his face bright and joyous , in spite of his illness . 
A marvellous change passed over him , his spirit seemed transformed . 
The old nurse would come in and say , `` Let me light the lamp before the holy image , my dear . '' 
And once he would not have allowed it and would have blown it out . 
`` Light it , light it , dear , I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it . 
You are praying when you light the lamp , and I am praying when I rejoice seeing you . 
So we are praying to the same God . '' 
Those words seemed strange to us , and mother would go to her room and weep , but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked cheerful .
