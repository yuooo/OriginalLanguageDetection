shouted Mitya . 
`` A ` double ' on the seven ! '' 
The seven too was trumped . 
`` Stop ! '' 
cried Kalganov suddenly . 
`` Double ! 
Double ! '' 
Mitya doubled his stakes , and each time he doubled the stake , the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles . 
The rouble stakes kept winning . 
`` On the double ! ''
