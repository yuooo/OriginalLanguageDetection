Need I confess , need I ? 
I am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I have shed , if only my wife and children may be spared . 
Will it be just to ruin them with me ? 
Are n't we making a mistake ? 
What is right in this case ? 
And will people recognise it , will they appreciate it , will they respect it ? '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
I thought to myself , `` he is thinking of other people 's respect at such a moment ! '' 
And I felt so sorry for him then , that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him . 
I saw he was beside himself .
