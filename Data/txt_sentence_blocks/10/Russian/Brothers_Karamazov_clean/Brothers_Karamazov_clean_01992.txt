Katya , do n't look disdainful . 
Dmitri is not a thief ! 
but a murderer ! 
He has murdered his father and ruined himself to hold his ground , rather than endure your pride . 
And he does n't love you . 
P.P.S. - I kiss your feet , farewel ! 
P.P.P.S. - Katya , pray to God that someone 'll give me the money . 
Then I shall not be steeped in gore , and if no one does - I shall ! 
Kill me ! 
Your slave and enemy , D. KARAMAZOV When Ivan read this `` document '' he was convinced .
