There was so to speak , a discordant note in the general harmony . 
`` Troy was founded by Teucer , Dardanus , Ilius and Tros , '' the boy rapped out at once , and in the same instant he blushed , blushed so , that it was painful to look at him . 
But the boys stared at him , stared at him for a whole minute , and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya , who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure . 
`` In what sense did they found it ? '' 
he deigned to comment at last . 
`` And what is meant by founding a city or a state ? 
What do they do ? 
Did they go and each lay a brick , do you suppose ? '' 
There was laughter . 
The offending boy turned from pink to crimson .
