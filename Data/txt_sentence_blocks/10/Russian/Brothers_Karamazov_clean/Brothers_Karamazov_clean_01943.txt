I beg you to leave me at this turning . 
It 's the way to your lodgings , too . 
You 'd better be particularly careful not to come to me to-day ! 
Do you hear ? '' 
He turned and walked on with a firm step , not looking back . 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha called after him , `` if anything happens to you to-day , turn to me before anyone ! '' 
But Ivan made no reply . 
Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross roads , till Ivan had vanished into the darkness . 
Then he turned and walked slowly homewards . 
Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings ; neither of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's empty house .
