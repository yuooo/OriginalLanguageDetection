It 's my character , my awful , unhappy character ! 
Oh , you will see , I shall end by driving him , too , to abandon me for another with whom he can get on better , like Dmitri . 
But ... no , I could not bear it , I should kill myself . 
And when you came in then , and when I called to you and told him to come back , I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred he turned on me that do you remember ? 
- I cried out to you that it was he , he alone who had persuaded me that his brother Dmitri was a murderer ! 
I said that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again . 
He had never , never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer . 
On the contrary , it was I who persuaded him ! 
Oh , my vile temper was the cause of everything ! 
I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial .
