shouted Mitya furiously . 
`` You 've lost two hundred , panie . 
Will you stake another hundred ? '' 
the Pole on the sofa inquired . 
`` What ? 
Lost two hundred already ? 
Then another two hundred ! 
All doubles ! '' 
And pulling his money out of his pocket , Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen , but Kalgonov covered it with his hand . 
`` That 's enough ! ''
