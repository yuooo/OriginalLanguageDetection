Take your cards . 
Make the bank . '' 
`` We 'll have cards from the landlord , panie , '' said the little Pole , gravely and emphatically . 
`` That 's much the best way , '' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` From the landlord ? 
Very good , I understand , let 's get them from him . 
Cards ! '' 
Mitya shouted to the landlord . 
The landlord brought in a new , unopened pack , and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready , and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon ; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived . 
Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders , but only three girls had arrived , and Marya was not there yet .
