Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it , and he could not even put it sensibly , for on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder 's cell , so that he could not have seen anything of the kind . 
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders . 
But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade , he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense , and at once longed to prove to his audience , and above all to himself , that he had not been talking nonsense . 
And , though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would be adding more and more absurdity , he could not restrain himself , and plunged forward blindly . 
`` How disgraceful ! '' 
cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
`` Pardon me ! '' 
said the Father Superior . 
`` It was said of old , ` Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me . 
And hearing it I have said to myself : it is the correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul . '
