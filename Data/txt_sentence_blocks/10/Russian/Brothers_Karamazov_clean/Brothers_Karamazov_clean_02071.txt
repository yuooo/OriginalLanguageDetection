I have naturally a kind and merry heart . ' 
I also write vaudevilles of all sorts . ' 
You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old , but my fate is a far more serious one . 
Before time was , by some decree which I could never make out , I was predestined ` to deny ' and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not at all inclined to negation . 
` No , you must go and deny , without denial there 's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of criticism ? ' 
Without criticism it would be nothing but one ` hosannah . ' 
But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life , the hosannah must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on , in the same style . 
But I do n't meddle in that , I did n't create it , I am not answerable for it . 
Well , they 've chosen their scapegoat , they 've made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible . 
We understand that comedy ; I , for instance , simply ask for annihilation .
