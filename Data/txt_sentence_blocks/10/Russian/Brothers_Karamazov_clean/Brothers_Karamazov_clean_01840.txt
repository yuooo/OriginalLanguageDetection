`` Why did you send for me to-day , Lise ? '' 
`` I wanted to tell you of a longing I have . 
I should like some one to torture me , marry me and then torture me , deceive me and go away . 
I do n't want to be happy . '' 
`` You are in love with disorder ? '' 
`` Yes , I want disorder . 
I keep wanting to set fire to the house . 
I keep imagining how I 'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly ; it must be on the sly . 
They 'll try to put it out , but it 'll go on burning . 
And I shall know and say nothing .
