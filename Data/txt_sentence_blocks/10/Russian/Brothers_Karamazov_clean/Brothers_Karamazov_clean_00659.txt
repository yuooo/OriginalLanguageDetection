Besides , I 've forgotten it . 
Well , good-bye ! 
I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind . 
Ah ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , I 've been out of my mind twice in my life . 
Go to Lise , cheer her up , as you always can so charmingly . 
Lise , '' she cried , going to her door , `` here I 've brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch , whom you insulted so . 
He is not at all angry , I assure you ; on the contrary , he is surprised that you could suppose so . '' 
`` Merci , maman . 
Come in , Alexey Fyodorovitch . ''
