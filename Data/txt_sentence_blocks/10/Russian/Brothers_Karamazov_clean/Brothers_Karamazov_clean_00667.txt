` On a higher footing ' is charming , Alexey Fyodorovitch ; but go on , go on ! '' 
`` You mean there is n't such an expression as ` on a higher footing ' ; but that does n't matter because - '' `` Oh , no , of course it does n't matter . 
Forgive me , Alyosha , dear ... . 
You know , I scarcely respected you till now - that is I respected you but on an equal footing ; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing . 
Do n't be angry , dear , at my joking , '' she put in at once , with strong feeling . 
`` I am absurd and small , but you , you ! 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
Is n't there in all our analysis - I mean your analysis ... no , better call it ours - are n't we showing contempt for him , for that poor man - in analysing his soul like this , as it were , from above , eh ? 
In deciding so certainly that he will take the money ? ''
