Think only of repentance , continual repentance , but dismiss fear altogether . 
Believe that God loves you as you can not conceive ; that He loves you with your sin , in your sin . 
It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men . 
Go , and fear not . 
Be not bitter against men . 
Be not angry if you are wronged . 
Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you . 
Be reconciled with him in truth . 
If you are penitent , you love . 
And if you love you are of God .
