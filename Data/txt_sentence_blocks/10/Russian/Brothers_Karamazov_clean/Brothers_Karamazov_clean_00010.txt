But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's other two sons , and of their origin . 
The Second Marriage and the Second Family VERY shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time . 
His second marriage lasted eight years . 
He took this second wife , Sofya Ivanovna , also a very young girl , from another province , where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew . 
Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital , and managed his business affairs very successfully , though , no doubt , not over-scrupulously . 
Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon , and was left from childhood an orphan without relations . 
She grew up in the house of a general 's widow , a wealthy old lady of good position , who was at once her benefactress and tormentor . 
I do not know the details , but I have only heard that the orphan girl , a meek and gentle creature , was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft , so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman , who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer ; inquiries were made about him and he was refused . 
But again , as in his first marriage , he proposed an elopement to the orphan girl .
