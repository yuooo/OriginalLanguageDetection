It may be wondered why , if he felt so certain , he had not gone to her at first , one of his own sort , so to speak , instead of to Samsonov , a man he did not know , who was not of his own class , and to whom he hardly knew how to speak . 
But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well , and had seen nothing of her for the last month , and that he knew she could not endure him . 
She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna , while she had , for some reason , suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over , and marry the `` charming , chivalrously refined Ivan , who had such excellent manners . '' 
Mitya 's manners she detested . 
Mitya positively laughed at her , and had once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated . 
But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him : `` If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna '' -LRB- and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject -RRB- `` why should she refuse me now that three thousand , just to enable me to leave Katya and get away from her for ever . 
These spoilt fine ladies , if they set their hearts on anything , will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice . 
Besides , she 's so rich , '' Mitya argued . 
As for his `` plan '' it was just the same as before ; it consisted of the offer of his rights to Tchermashnya - but not with a commercial object , as it had been with Samsonov , not trying to allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand - but simply as a security for the debt . 
As he worked out this new idea , Mitya was enchanted with it , but so it always was with him in all his undertakings , in all his sudden decisions .
