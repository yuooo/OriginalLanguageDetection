An answer came , but not at once , after an interval of perhaps ten seconds .

Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold .

On the left was a large Russian stove . 
From the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the room , and on it there were rags hanging . 
There was a bedstead against the wall on each side , right and left , covered with knitted quilts .
