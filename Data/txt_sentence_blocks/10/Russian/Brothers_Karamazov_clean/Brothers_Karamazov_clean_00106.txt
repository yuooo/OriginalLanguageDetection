My Nikita , my Nikita , you are waiting for me , '' the woman began in a sing-song voice ; but the elder had already turned away to a very old woman , dressed like a dweller in the town , not like a pilgrim . 
Her eyes showed that she had come with an object , and in order to say something . 
She said she was the widow of a non-commissioned officer , and lived close by in the town . 
Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat service , and had gone to Irkutsk in Siberia . 
He had written twice from there , but now a year had passed since he had written . 
She did inquire about him , but she did not know the proper place to inquire . 
`` Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna - she 's a rich merchant 's wife - said to me , ` You go , Prohorovna , and put your son 's name down for prayer in the church , and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead . 
His soul will be troubled , ' she said , ` and he will write you a letter . ' 
And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many times tried . 
Only I am in doubt ... .
