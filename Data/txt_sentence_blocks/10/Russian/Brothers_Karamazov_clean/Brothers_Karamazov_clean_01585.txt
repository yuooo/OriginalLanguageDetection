`` Did he never say before you ... casually , or in a moment of irritation , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly , `` that he intended to make an attempt on his father 's life ? '' 
`` Ach , he did say so , '' sighed Grushenka . 
`` Once or several times ? ''

`` I had faith in his noble heart . '' 
`` Gentlemen , allow me , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna , in your presence . ''
