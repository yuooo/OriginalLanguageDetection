Please remind me of it yourself . 
As soon as my tongue runs away with me , you just say ` the important thing ? ' 
Ach ! 
how do I know now what is of most importance ? 
Ever since Lise took back her promise - her childish promise , Alexey Fyodorovitch - to marry you , you 've realised , of course , that it was only the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair - thank God , she can walk now ! 
... that-new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother , who will to-morrow - but why speak of to-morrow ? 
I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow . 
Ready to die of curiosity ... . 
That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise ... . 
I paid him fifty roubles for the visit .
