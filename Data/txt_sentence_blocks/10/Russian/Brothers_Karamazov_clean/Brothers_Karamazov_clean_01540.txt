No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me .
