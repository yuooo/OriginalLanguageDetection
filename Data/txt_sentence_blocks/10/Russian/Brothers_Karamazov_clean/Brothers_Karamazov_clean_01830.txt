And , besides , who is n't suffering from aberration nowadays ? 
- you , I , all of us , are in a state of aberration , and there are ever so many examples of it : a man sits singing a song , suddenly something annoys him , he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across , and no one blames him for it . 
I read that lately , and all the doctors confirm it . 
The doctors are always confirming ; they confirm , - anything . 
Why , my Lise is in a state of aberration . 
She made me cry again yesterday , and the day before , too , and to-day I suddenly realised that it 's all due to aberration . 
Oh , Lise grieves me so ! 
I believe she 's quite mad . 
Why did she send for you ? 
Did she send for you or did you come of yourself ? ''
