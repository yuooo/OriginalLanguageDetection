He went to the other end of the table , moved up a chair and sat down on it . 
`` Why do you look at me without speaking ? 
We only come with one question , and I swear I wo n't go without an answer . 
Has the young lady , Katerina Ivanovna , been with you ? '' 
Smerdyakov still remained silent , looking quietly at Ivan as before . 
Suddenly , with a motion of his hand , he turned his face away . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Nothing . ''
