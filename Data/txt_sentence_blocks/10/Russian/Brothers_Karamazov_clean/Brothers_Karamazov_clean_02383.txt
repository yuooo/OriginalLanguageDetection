Rakitin had tried to force his way in twice , but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky not to admit him . 
Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing gown , rather feverish , with a towel , soaked in vinegar and water , on his head . 
He looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression , but there was a shade of something like dread discernible in it . 
He had become terribly preoccupied since the trial ; sometimes he would be silent for half an hour together , and seemed to be pondering something heavily and painfully , oblivious of everything about him . 
If he roused himself from his brooding and began to talk , he always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never of what he really wanted to say . 
He looked sometimes with a face of suffering at his brother . 
He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka than with Alyosha . 
It is true , he scarcely spoke to her at all , but as soon as she came in , his whole face lighted up with joy . 
Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence . 
This time Mitya was waiting for Alyosha in suspense , but he did not dare ask him a question .
