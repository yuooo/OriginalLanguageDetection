I could take you in my arms , Alyosha , and press you to my bosom till I crush you , for in the whole world - in reality - in real-i-ty - -LRB- can you take it in ? -RRB- 
I love no one but you ! 
He uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation . 
`` No one but you and one ` jade ' I have fallen in love with , to my ruin . 
But being in love does n't mean loving . 
You may be in love with a woman and yet hate her . 
Remember that ! 
I can talk about it gaily still . 
Sit down here by the table and I 'll sit beside you and look at you , and go on talking . 
You shall keep quiet and I 'll go on talking , for the time has come .
