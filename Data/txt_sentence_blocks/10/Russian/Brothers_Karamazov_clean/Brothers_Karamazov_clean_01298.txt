He 's awfully low , but it 's natural to him , eh ? 
Do n't you think so ? 
Some people are low from self-interest , but he 's simply so , from nature . 
Only fancy , he claims -LRB- he was arguing about it all the way yesterday -RRB- that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him . 
Do you remember , there 's a landowner called Maximov in it , whom Nozdryov thrashed . 
He was charged , do you remember , ` for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition . ' 
Would you believe it , he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten ! 
Now can it be so ? 
Tchitchikov made his journey , at the very latest , at the beginning of the twenties , so that the dates do n't fit . 
He could n't have been thrashed then , he could n't , could he ? ''
