I got up at last , I felt afraid . 
`` Well ? '' 
He looked at me . 
`` Go ! '' 
said I , `` confess . 
Everything passes , only the truth remains . 
Your children will understand , when they grow up , the nobility of your resolution . '' 
He left me that time as though he had made up his mind . 
Yet for more than a fortnight afterwards , he came to me every evening , still preparing himself , still unable to bring himself to the point . 
He made my heart ache .
