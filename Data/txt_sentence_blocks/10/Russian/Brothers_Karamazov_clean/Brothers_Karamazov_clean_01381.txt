Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips . 
`` Do n't touch me ... '' she faltered , in an imploring voice . 
`` Do n't touch me , till I 'm yours ... . 
I 've told you I 'm yours , but do n't touch me ... spare me ... . 
With them here , with them close , you must n't . 
He 's here . 
It 's nasty here ... '' `` I 'll obey you ! 
I wo n't think of it ... I worship you ! '' 
muttered Mitya . 
`` Yes , it 's nasty here , it 's abominable . ''
