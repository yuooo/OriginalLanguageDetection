She was still alive , and had not , all those eight years , forgotten the insult done her . 
All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya 's manner of life , and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers : `` It serves her right . 
God has punished her for her ingratitude . '' 
Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna 's death the general 's widow suddenly appeared in our town , and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's house . 
She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal . 
It was evening . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch , whom she had not seen for those eight years , came in to her drunk . 
The story is that instantly upon seeing him , without any sort of explanation , she gave him two good , resounding slaps on the face , seized him by a tuft of hair , and shook him three times up and down . 
Then , without a word , she went straight to the cottage to the two boys . 
Seeing , at the first glance , that they were unwashed and in dirty linen , she promptly gave Grigory , too , a box on the ear , and announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them just as they were in a rug , put them in the carriage , and drove off to her own town .
