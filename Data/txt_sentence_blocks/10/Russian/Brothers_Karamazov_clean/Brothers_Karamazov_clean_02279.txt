When we told him that Grigory saw the door was open before he fell down , and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of his bedroom - Karamazov was positively crushed . 
My esteemed and witty colleague , Nikolay Parfenovitch , told me afterwards that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him . 
And to improve matters , the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little bag - so be it , you shall hear this romance ! 
`` Gentlemen of the jury , I have told you already why I consider this romance not only an absurdity , but the most improbable invention that could have been brought forward in the circumstances . 
If one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story , one could hardly find anything more incredible . 
The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary storytellers neglect as insignificant trifles . 
Oh , they have no thought to spare for such details , their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole , and fancy anyone daring to pull them up for a trifle ! 
But that 's how they are caught . 
The prisoner was asked the question , ` Where did you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you ? ' ' 
I made it myself . '
