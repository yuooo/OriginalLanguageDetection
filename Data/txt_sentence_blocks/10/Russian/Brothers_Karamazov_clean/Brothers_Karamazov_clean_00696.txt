`` I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds , if they rhyme , '' the woman 's voice continued . 
`` Why do n't you go on ? ''

On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
`` It was even better last time , '' observed the woman 's voice . 
`` You sang ` If my darling be in health ' ; it sounded more tender . 
I suppose you 've forgotten to-day . ''
