I do n't know whether he saw her , but in the evening he was at the Metropolis , where he got thoroughly drunk . 
Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself . 
It was a wordy , disconnected , frantic letter , a drunken letter , in fact . 
It was like the talk of a drunken man , who , on his return home , begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted , what a rascal had just insulted him , what a fine fellow he is on the other hand , and how he will pay that scoundrel out ; and all that at great length , with great excitement and incoherence , with drunken tears and blows on the table . 
The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind . 
It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it . 
There was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest . 
The letter ran as follows : FATAL KATYA : To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell , woman of great wrath , but farewell , too , my love ! 
Let us make an end ! 
To-morrow I shall try and get it from everyone , and if I ca n't borrow it , I give you my word of honour I shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from under the pillow , if only Ivan has gone .
