Above all , he knew where to draw the line . 
He could restrain himself on occasion , and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline . 
But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school , and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation , inventing something , something effective and conspicuous . 
He was extremely vain . 
He knew how to make even his mother give way to him ; he was almost despotic in his control of her . 
She gave way to him , oh , she had given way to him for years . 
The one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her . 
She was always fancying that Kolya was `` unfeeling '' to her , and at times , dissolving into hysterical tears , she used to reproach him with his coldness . 
The boy disliked this , and the more demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him , the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them . 
Yet it was not intentional on his part but instinctive - it was his character .
