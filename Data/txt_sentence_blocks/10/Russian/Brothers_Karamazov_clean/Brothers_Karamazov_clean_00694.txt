There was a circle on the table , left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before . 
Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind , as they always do in a time of tedious waiting . 
He wondered , for instance , why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before , why not in the other seat . 
At last he felt very depressed - depressed by suspense and uncertainty . 
But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour , when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close . 
People were sitting , or had only just sat down , somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away . 
Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before , he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the bushes on the left , by the fence . 
The people must be sitting on it now . 
Who were they ? 
A man 's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto , accompanying himself on the guitar : With invincible force I am bound to my dear .
