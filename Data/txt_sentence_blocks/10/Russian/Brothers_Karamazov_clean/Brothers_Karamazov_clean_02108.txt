He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not Satan , with scorched wings , in thunder and lightning . 
But he is not Satan : that 's a lie . 
He is an impostor . 
He is simply a devil - a paltry , trivial devil . 
He goes to the baths . 
If you undressed him , you 'd be sure to find he had a tail , long and smooth like a Danish dog 's , a yard long , dun colour ... . 
Alyosha , you are cold . 
You 've been in the snow . 
Would you like some tea ? 
What ?
