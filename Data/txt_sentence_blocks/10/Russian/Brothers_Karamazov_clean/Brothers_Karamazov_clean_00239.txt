Bethink yourselves Fathers , I will go . 
But I will take my son , Alexey , away from here for ever , on my parental authority . 
Ivan Fyodorovitch , my most dutiful son , permit me to order you to follow me . 
Von Sohn , what have you to stay for ? 
Come and see me now in the town . 
It is fun there . 
It is only one short verst ; instead of lenten oil , I will give you sucking-pig and kasha . 
We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it ... . 
I 've cloudberry wine . 
Hey , von Sohn , do n't lose your chance . ''
