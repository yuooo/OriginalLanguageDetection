Behold what Thou didst further . 
And all again in the name of freedom ! 
I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born . 
But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom . 
In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner ; give bread , and man will worship thee , for nothing is more certain than bread . 
But if someone else gains possession of his conscience - Oh ! 
then he will cast away Thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience . 
In that Thou wast right . 
For the secret of man 's being is not only to live but to have something to live for . 
Without a stable conception of the object of life , man would not consent to go on living , and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth , though he had bread in abundance .
