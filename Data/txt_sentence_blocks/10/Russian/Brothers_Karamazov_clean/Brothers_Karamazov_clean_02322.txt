I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself . 
His conception of culture was limited to good clothes , clean shirt-fronts and polished boots . 
Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch -LRB- there is evidence of this -RRB- , he might well have resented his position , compared with that of his master 's legitimate sons . 
They had everything , he nothing . 
They had all the rights , they had the inheritance , while he was only the cook . 
He told me himself that he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope . 
The destination of that sum - a sum which would have made his career - must have been hateful to him . 
Moreover , he saw three thousand roubles in new rainbow-coloured notes . 
-LRB- I asked him about that on purpose . -RRB- 
Oh , beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once !
