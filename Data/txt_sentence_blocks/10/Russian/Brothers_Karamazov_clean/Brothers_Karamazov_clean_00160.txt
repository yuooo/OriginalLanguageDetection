Even when he was excited and talking irritably , his eyes somehow did not follow his mood , but betrayed something else , sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing . 
`` It 's hard to tell what he 's thinking , '' those who talked to him sometimes declared . 
People who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh , which bore witness to mirthful and light-hearted thoughts at the very time when his eyes were so gloomy . 
A certain strained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment . 
Everyone knew , or had heard of , the extremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading of late , as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused in his quarrels with his father . 
There were several stories current in the town about it . 
It is true that he was irascible by nature , `` of an unstable and unbalanced mind , '' as our justice of the peace , Katchalnikov , happily described him . 
He was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned frock-coat . 
He wore black gloves and carried a top hat . 
Having only lately left the army , he still had moustaches and no beard .
