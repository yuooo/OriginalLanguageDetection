Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully . 
`` Whom have you been beating now ... or killing , perhaps ? '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
said Mitya . 
`` Do n't worry , '' said Mitya , and he suddenly laughed . 
`` I smashed an old woman in the market-place just now . '' 
`` Smashed ? 
An old woman ? '' 
`` An old man ! '' 
cried Mitya , looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face , laughing , and shouting at him as though he were deaf .
