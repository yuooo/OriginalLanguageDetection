`` Do you see ? '' 
he shrieked again , pointing to them . 
`` Look there ! '' 
And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel , gasping and exclaiming as he did so : `` So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! '' 
Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha , and his whole figure expressed unutterable pride . 
`` Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honour , '' he cried , raising his arm in the air . 
Then he turned quickly and began to run ; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and kissed his hand to Alyosha .
