He relapsed into gloomy silence . 
`` Could n't you , without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point , could you not , at the same time , give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer , at a crisis so full of danger to you ? '' 
Mitya smiled mournfully , almost dreamily . 
`` I 'm much more good-natured than you think , gentlemen . 
I 'll tell you the reason why and give you that hint , though you do n't deserve it . 
I wo n't speak of that , gentlemen , because it would be a stain on my honour . 
The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father , if I had murdered and robbed him . 
That 's why I ca n't tell you . 
I ca n't for fear of disgrace . 
What , gentlemen , are you going to write that down ? ''
