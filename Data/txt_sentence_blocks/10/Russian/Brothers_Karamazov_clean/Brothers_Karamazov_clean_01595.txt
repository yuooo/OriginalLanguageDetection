I warn you of that . 
I 'll fight it out with you to the end , and then God will decide . 
Good-bye , gentlemen , do n't be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the examination .

His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand , but Nikolay Parfenovitch , who happened to stand nearest to him , with a sudden , almost nervous movement , hid his hands behind his back .
