Miusov asked Ivan abruptly . 
`` Why not ? 
I was especially invited yesterday . '' 
`` Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner , '' said Miusov with the same irritability , regardless of the fact that the monk was listening . 
`` We ought , at least , to apologise for the disturbance , and explain that it was not our doing . 
What do you think ? '' 
`` Yes , we must explain that it was n't our doing . 
Besides , father wo n't be there , '' observed Ivan . 
`` Well , I should hope not ! 
Confound this dinner ! ''
