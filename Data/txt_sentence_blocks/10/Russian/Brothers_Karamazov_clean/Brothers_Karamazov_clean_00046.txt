He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word . 
Alyosha noticed that many , almost all , went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness , but came out with bright and happy faces . 
Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern . 
On the contrary , he was always almost gay . 
The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful , and the greater the sinner the more he loved him . 
There were , no doubt , up to the end of his life , among the monks some who hated and envied him , but they were few in number and they were silent , though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery , one , for instance , of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence . 
But the majority were on Father Zossima 's side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts , warmly and sincerely . 
Some were almost fanatically devoted to him , and declared , though not quite aloud , that he was a saint , that there could be no doubt of it , and , seeing that his end was near , they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics . 
Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder , just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church . 
He saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them , return shortly after - some the next day - and , falling in tears at the elder 's feet , thank him for healing their sick .
