`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . ''
