What is the meaning of that great word ? 
What is the great idea in that name ? 
We have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be . 
In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching - in the present case , the father , Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov , did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we have just referred . 
That 's the misfortune . 
And indeed some fathers are a misfortune . 
Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely : we must shrink from nothing , gentlemen of the jury , considering the importance of the decision you have to make . 
It 's our particular duty not to shrink from any idea , like children or frightened women , as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it . 
`` But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent -LRB- and he was my opponent before I opened my lips -RRB- exclaimed several times , ` Oh , I will not yield the defence of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from Petersburg . 
I accuse , but I defend also ! '
