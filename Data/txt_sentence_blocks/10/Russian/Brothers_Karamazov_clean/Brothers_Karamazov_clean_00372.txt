`` You lie , accursed one ! '' 
hissed Grigory . 
`` Consider yourself , Grigory Vassilyevitch , '' Smerdyakov went on , staid and unruffled , conscious of his triumph , but , as it were , generous to the vanquished foe . 
`` Consider yourself , Grigory Vassilyevitch ; it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith , even as a mustard seed , and bid a mountain move into the sea , it will move without the least delay at your bidding . 
Well , Grigory Vassilyevitch , if I 'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me , you try yourself telling this mountain , not to move into the sea for that 's a long way off , but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden . 
You 'll see for yourself that it wo n't budge , but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it , and that shows , Grigory Vassilyevitch , that you have n't faith in the proper manner , and only abuse others about it . 
Again , taking into consideration that no one in our day , not only you , but actually no one , from the highest person to the lowest peasant , can shove mountains into the sea - except perhaps some one man in the world , or , at most , two , and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert , so you would n't find them - if so it be , if all the rest have no faith , will God curse all the rest ? 
that is , the population of the whole earth , except about two hermits in the desert , and in His well-known mercy will He not forgive one of them ? 
And so I 'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance . '' 
`` Stay ! ''
