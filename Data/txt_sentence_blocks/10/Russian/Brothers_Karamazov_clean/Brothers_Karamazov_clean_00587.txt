You love him just as he is ; you love him for insulting you . 
If he reformed , you 'd give him up at once and cease to love him . 
But you need him so as to contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity . 
And it all comes from your pride . 
Oh , there 's a great deal of humiliation and self-abasement about it , but it all comes from pride ... . 
I am too young and I 've loved you too much . 
I know that I ought not to say this , that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you , and it would be less offensive for you . 
But I am going far away , and shall never come back ... . 
It is for ever . 
I do n't want to sit beside a ` laceration . '
