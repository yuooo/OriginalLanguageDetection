`` I will tell you instead , gentlemen , another interesting and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself . 
Only five days ago , in a gathering here , principally of ladies , he solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their neighbours . 
That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind , and that , if there had been any love on earth hitherto , it was not owing to a natural law , but simply because men have believed in immortality . 
Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that faith , and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality , not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried up . 
Moreover , nothing then would be immoral , everything would be lawful , even cannibalism . 
That 's not all . 
He ended by asserting that for every individual , like ourselves , who does not believe in God or immortality , the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact contrary of the former religious law , and that egoism , even to crime , must become not only lawful but even recognised as the inevitable , the most rational , even honourable outcome of his position . 
From this paradox , gentlemen , you can judge of the rest of our eccentric and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch 's theories . '' 
`` Excuse me , '' Dmitri cried suddenly ; `` if I 've heard aright , crime must not only be permitted but even recognised as the inevitable and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel ! 
Is that so or not ? ''
