cried Mitya , `` wo n't you drink it ? '' 
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass , raised it and said with a resonant voice : `` To Russia as she was before 1772 . '' 
`` Come , that 's better ! '' 
cried the other Pole , and they both emptied their glasses at once . 
`` You 're fools , you Panovie , '' broke suddenly from Mitya . 
`` Panie ! '' 
shouted both the Poles , menacingly , setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks . 
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious . 
`` Can one help loving one 's own country ? '' 
he shouted .
