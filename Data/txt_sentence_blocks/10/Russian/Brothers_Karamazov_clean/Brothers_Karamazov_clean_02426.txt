Let us make a compact here , at Ilusha 's stone , that we will never forget Ilusha and one another . 
And whatever happens to us later in life , if we do n't meet for twenty years afterwards , let us always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones , do you remember , by the bridge ? 
and afterwards we all grew so fond of him . 
He was a fine boy , a kindhearted , brave boy , he felt for his father 's honour and resented the cruel insult to him and stood up for him . 
And so in the first place , we will remember him , boys , all our lives . 
And even if we are occupied with most important things , if we attain to honour or fall into great misfortune - still let us remember how good it was once here , when we were all together , united by a good and kind feeling which made us , for the time we were loving that poor boy , better perhaps than we are . 
My little doves let me call you so , for you are very like them , those pretty blue birds , at this minute as I look at your good dear faces . 
My dear children , perhaps you wo n't understand what I am saying to you , because I often speak very unintelligibly , but you 'll remember all the same and will agree with my words some time . 
You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory , especially a memory of childhood , of home . 
People talk to you a great deal about your education , but some good , sacred memory , preserved from childhood , is perhaps the best education .
