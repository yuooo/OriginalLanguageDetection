They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps , that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard . 
My mother hesitated for a long time , it was awful to part with her only child , but she made up her mind to it at last , though not without many tears , believing she was acting for my happiness . 
She brought me to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps , and I never saw her again . 
For she too died three years afterwards . 
She spent those three years mourning and grieving for both of us . 
From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious memories , for there are no memories more precious than those of early childhood in one 's first home . 
And that is almost always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all . 
Indeed , precious memories may remain even of a bad home , if only the heart knows how to find what is precious . 
With my memories of home I count , too , my memories of the Bible , which , child as I was , I was very eager to read at home . 
I had a book of Scripture history then with excellent pictures , called A Hundred and Four Stories from the Old and New Testament , and I learned to read from it .
