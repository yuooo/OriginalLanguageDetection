We 've everything you have , I am revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you ; though it 's forbidden . 
This legend is about Paradise . 
There was , they say , here on earth a thinker and philosopher . 
He rejected everything , ` laws , conscience , faith , ' and , above all , the future life . 
He died ; he expected to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before him . 
He was astounded and indignant . 
` This is against my principles ! ' 
he said . 
And he was punished for that ... that is , you must excuse me , I am just repeating what I heard myself , it 's only a legend ... he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometres in the dark -LRB- we 've adopted the metric system , you know -RRB- : and when he has finished that quadrillion , the gates of heaven would be opened to him and he 'll be forgiven - '' `` And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion kilometres ? '' 
asked Ivan , with a strange eagerness .
