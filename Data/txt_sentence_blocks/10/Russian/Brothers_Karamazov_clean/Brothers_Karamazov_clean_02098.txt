* But after all , that 's stupid . 
A loud , persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window . 
Ivan jumped up from the sofa . 
`` Do you hear ? 
You 'd better open , '' cried the visitor ; `` it 's your brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news , I 'll be bound ! '' 
`` Be silent , deceiver , I knew it was Alyosha , I felt he was coming , and of course he has not come for nothing ; of course he brings ` news , ' '' Ivan exclaimed frantically . 
`` Open , open to him . 
There 's a snowstorm and he is your brother . 
Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait ? 
C'est a ne pas mettre un chien dehors . ''
