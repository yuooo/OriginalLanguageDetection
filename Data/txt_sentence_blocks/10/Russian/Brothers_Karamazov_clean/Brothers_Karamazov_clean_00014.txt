Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave , without a word , and when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that , `` God would repay her for orphans . ''

Fyodor Pavlovitch , thinking it over , decided that it was a good thing , and did not refuse the general 's widow his formal consent to any proposition in regard to his children 's education . 
As for the slaps she had given him , he drove all over the town telling the story . 
It happened that the old lady died soon after this , but she left the boys in her will a thousand roubles each `` for their instruction , and so that all be spent on them exclusively , with the condition that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one , for it is more than adequate provision for such children .

He became especially fond of the younger , Alexey , who lived for a long while as one of his family .
