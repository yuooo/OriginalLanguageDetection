What 's more , I believe they would have been mortified if his guilt had not been so firmly established , as that would have lessened the effect of the closing scene of the criminal 's acquittal . 
That he would be acquitted , all the ladies , strange to say , were firmly persuaded up to the very last moment . 
`` He is guilty , but he will be acquitted , from motives of humanity , in accordance with the new ideas , the new sentiments that had come into fashion , '' and so on , and so on . 
And that was why they had crowded into the court so impatiently . 
The men were more interested in the contest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch . 
All were wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like Fetyukovitch 's make of such a desperate case ; and so they followed his achievements , step by step , with concentrated attention . 
But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end , up to his speech . 
Persons of experience suspected that he had some design , that he was working towards some object , but it was almost impossible to guess what it was . 
His confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable , however . 
Everyone noticed with pleasure , moreover , that he , after so short a stay , not more than three days , perhaps , among us , had so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the case and `` had studied it to a nicety . ''
