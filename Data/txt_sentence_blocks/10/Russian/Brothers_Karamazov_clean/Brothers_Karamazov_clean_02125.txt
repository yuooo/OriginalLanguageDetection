I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume , even a very large one . 
And so I trust I may not be reproached , for confining myself to what struck me . 
I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance , and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details . 
But I see I shall do better not to apologise . 
I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can . 
And , to begin with , before entering the court , I will mention what surprised me most on that day . 
Indeed , as it appeared later , everyone was surprised at it , too . 
We all knew that the affair had aroused great interest , that everyone was burning with impatience for the trial to begin , that it had been a subject of talk , conjecture , exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society . 
Everyone knew , too , that the case had become known throughout Russia , but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning , such intense , interest in everyone , not only among ourselves , but all over Russia . 
This became evident at the trial this day .
