Grigory stood with a perplexed face , looking straight at his tormentor . 
Strange to say , it appeared he really did not know what year it was . 
`` But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands ? '' 
`` I am a servant , '' Grigory said suddenly , in a loud and distinct voice . 
`` If my betters think fit to make game of me , it is my duty to suffer it . '' 
Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback , and the President intervened , reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions . 
Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness . 
The public and the jury , of course , were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might , while undergoing a certain cure , have seen `` the gates of heaven , '' and who did not even know what year he was living in . 
But before Grigory left the box another episode occurred .
