Then I wonder - hooks ? 
Where would they get them ? 
What of ? 
Iron hooks ? 
Where do they forge them ? 
Have they a foundry there of some sort ? 
The monks in the monastery probably believe that there 's a ceiling in hell , for instance . 
Now I 'm ready to believe in hell , but without a ceiling . 
It makes it more refined , more enlightened , more Lutheran that is . 
And , after all , what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or has n't ?
