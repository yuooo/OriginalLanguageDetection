yelled Mitya , `` she 's pure and shining , and I have never been her lover ! 
That 's a lie ... '' `` How dare you defend me to him ? '' 
shrieked Grushenka . 
`` It was n't virtue kept me pure , and it was n't that I was afraid of Kuzma , but that I might hold up my head when I met him , and tell him he 's a scoundrel . 
And he did actually refuse the money ? '' 
`` He took it ! 
He took it ! '' 
cried Mitya ; `` only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once , and I could only give him seven hundred straight off . '' 
`` I see : he heard I had money , and came here to marry me ! '' 
`` Pani Agrippina ! ''
