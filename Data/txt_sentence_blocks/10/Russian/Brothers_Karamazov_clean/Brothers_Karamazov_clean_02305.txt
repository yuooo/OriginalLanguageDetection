`` I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen hundred that he had . 
and everyone knew that he was without money before that night . 
Who knew it , pray ? 
The prisoner has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that money , and if you will have it so , gentlemen of the jury , nothing can be more probable than that statement , and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner . 
The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance . 
A man of weak will , who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his betrothed , could not , we are told , have set aside half and sewn it up , but would , even if he had done so , have unpicked it every two days and taken out a hundred , and so would have spent it all in a month . 
All this , you will remember , was put forward in a tone what brooked no contradiction . 
But what if the thing happened quite differently ? 
What if you 've been weaving a romance , and about quite a different kind of man ? 
That 's just it , you have invented quite a different man !
