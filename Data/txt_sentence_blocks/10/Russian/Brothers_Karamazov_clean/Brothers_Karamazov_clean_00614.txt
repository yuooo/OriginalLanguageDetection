said the captain , suddenly turning to Alyosha , as though he were going to attack him . 
`` I am sorry about your finger , sir ; but instead of thrashing Ilusha , would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath ? 
I should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance . 
You wo n't ask for the fifth one too ? '' 
He stopped short with a catch in his throat . 
Every feature in his face was twitching and working ; he looked extremely defiant . 
He was in a sort of frenzy . 
`` I think I understand it all now , '' said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully , still keeping his seat . 
`` So your boy is a good boy , he loves his father , and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant ... . 
Now I understand it , '' he repeated thoughtfully .
