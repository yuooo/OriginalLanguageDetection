`` But how can I possibly be responsible for all ? '' 
everyone would laugh in my face . 
`` Can I , for instance , be responsible for you ? '' 
`` You may well not know it , '' I would answer , `` since the whole world has long been going on a different line , since we consider the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others . 
Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and , well , you all look upon me as a madman . 
Though you are friendly to me , yet , you see , you all laugh at me . '' 
`` But how can we help being friendly to you ? '' 
said my hostess , laughing . 
The room was full of people .
