Here I must mention that Smerdyakov , oppressed by terror and despair of a sort , had felt during those last few days that one of the fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain , might be coming upon him again . 
The day and hour of such an attack can not , of course , be foreseen , but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one . 
So the doctors tell us . 
And so , as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard , Smerdyakov , depressed by his lonely and unprotected position , went to the cellar . 
He went down the stairs wondering if he would have a fit or not , and what if it were to come upon him at once . 
And that very apprehension , that very wonder , brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks , and he fell unconscious into the cellar . 
And in this perfectly natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion , a hint that he was shamming an attack on purpose . 
But , if it were on purpose , the question arises at once , what was his motive ? 
What was he reckoning on ? 
What was he aiming at ?
