`` It 's easy enough to thrust them upon one . 
And who wrote them ? 
Can they have been written by men ? '' 
`` The Holy Spirit wrote them , '' said I. `` It 's easy for you to prate , '' he smiled again , this time almost with hatred . 
I took the book again , opened it in another place and showed him the Epistle to the Hebrews , chapter 10 , verse 31 . 
He read : `` It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . '' 
He read it and simply flung down the book . 
He was trembling all over . 
`` An awful text , '' he said . 
`` There 's no denying you 've picked out fitting ones . ''
