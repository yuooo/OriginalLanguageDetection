No sort of scientific teaching , no kind of common interest , will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all . 
Everyone will think his share too small and they will be always envying , complaining and attacking one another . 
You ask when it will come to pass ; it will come to pass , but first we have to go though the period of isolation . '' 
`` What do you mean by isolation ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` Why , the isolation that prevails everywhere , above all in our age - it has not fully developed , it has not reached its limit yet . 
For everyone strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible , wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself ; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction , for instead of self-realisation he ends by arriving at complete solitude . 
All mankind in our age have split up into units , they all keep apart , each in his own groove ; each one holds aloof , hides himself and hides what he has , from the rest , and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them . 
He heaps up riches by himself and thinks , ` How strong I am now and how secure , ' and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up , the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence . 
For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole ; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others , in men and in humanity , and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself .
