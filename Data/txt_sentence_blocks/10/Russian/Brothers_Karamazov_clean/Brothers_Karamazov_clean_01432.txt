All this is horribly upsetting , horribly . 
A man is not a drum , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Drink a little more water , '' murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed . 
His eyes were confident . 
He seemed completely transformed in a moment . 
His whole bearing was changed ; he was once more the equal of these men , with all of whom he was acquainted , as though they had all met the day before , when nothing had happened , at some social gathering . 
We may note in passing that , on his first arrival , Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captain 's , but later , during the last month especially , Mitya had hardly called at all , and when the police captain met him , in the street , for instance , Mitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness . 
His acquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate , though he sometimes paid his wife , a nervous and fanciful lady , visits of politeness , without quite knowing why , and she always received him graciously and had , for some reason , taken an interest in him up to the last . 
He had not had time to get to know the investigating lawyer , though he had met him and talked to him twice , each time about the fair sex .
