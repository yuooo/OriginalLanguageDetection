Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the triviality , the incompleteness , and the fantastic character of the evidence , if you examine each part of it separately ; or , at least , you would have hesitated to ruin a man 's life simply from the prejudice against him which he has , alas ! 
only too well deserved . 
But it 's not an ordinary case of murder , it 's a case of parricide . 
That impresses men 's minds , and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind . 
How can such a prisoner be acquitted ? 
What if he committed the murder and gets off unpunished ? 
That is what everyone , almost involuntarily , instinctively , feels at heart . 
`` Yes , it 's a fearful thing to shed a father 's blood - the father who has begotten me , loved me , not spared his life for me , grieved over my illnesses from childhood up , troubled all his life for my happiness , and has lived in my joys , in my successes . 
To murder such a father - that 's inconceivable . 
Gentlemen of the jury , what is a father - a real father ?
