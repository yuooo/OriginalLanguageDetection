cried Mitya . 
`` The famous French writer , Piron . 
We were all drinking then , a big party of us , in a tavern at that very fair . 
They 'd invited me , and first of all I began quoting epigrams . 
` Is that you , Boileau ? 
What a funny get-up ! ' 
and Boileau answers that he 's going to a masquerade , that is to the baths , he he ! 
And they took it to themselves , so I made haste to repeat another , very sarcastic , well known to all educated people : Yes , Sappho and Phaon are we ! 
But one grief is weighing on me . 
You do n't know your way to the sea !
