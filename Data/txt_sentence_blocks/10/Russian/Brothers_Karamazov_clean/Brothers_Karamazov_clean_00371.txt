He must have been with the Jesuits , somewhere , Ivan . 
Oh , you stinking Jesuit , who taught you ? 
But you 're talking nonsense , you casuist , nonsense , nonsense , nonsense . 
Do n't cry , Grigory , we 'll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment . 
Tell me this , O ass ; you may be right before your enemies , but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart , and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed . 
And if once you 're anathema they wo n't pat you on the head for it in hell . 
What do you say to that , my fine Jesuit ? '' 
`` There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart , but there no special sin in that . 
Or if there was sin , it was the most ordinary . '' 
`` How 's that the most ordinary ? ''
