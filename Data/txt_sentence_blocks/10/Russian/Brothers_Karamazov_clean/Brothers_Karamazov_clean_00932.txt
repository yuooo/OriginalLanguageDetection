At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim , by the young life he had destroyed , by the blood that cried out for vengeance . 
He had begun to have awful dreams . 
But , being a man of fortitude , he bore his suffering a long time , thinking : `` I shall expiate everything by this secret agony . '' 
But that hope , too , was vain ; the longer it went on , the more intense was his suffering . 
He was respected in society for his active benevolence , though everyone was overawed by his stern and gloomy character . 
But the more he was respected , the more intolerable it was for him . 
He confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself . 
But he began to be haunted by another idea - an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable , though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off . 
He dreamed of rising up , going out and confessing in the face of all men that he had committed murder . 
For three years this dream had pursued him , haunting him in different forms .
