He sat without moving , and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat . 
He seemed to have slept for two hours or more . 
He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have screamed . 
There was a hammering in his temples , and the top of his head ached . 
It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him . 
At last he realised that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove , and that he might die of suffocation . 
And the drunken peasant still lay snoring . 
The candle guttered and was about to go out . 
Mitya cried out , and ran staggering across the passage into the forester 's room . 
The forester waked up at once , but hearing that the other room was full of fumes , to Mitya 's surprise and annoyance , accepted the fact with strange unconcern , though he did go to see to it .
