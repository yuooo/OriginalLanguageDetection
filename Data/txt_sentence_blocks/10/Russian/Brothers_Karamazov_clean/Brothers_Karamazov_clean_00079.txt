Almost everyone admitted to the cell felt that a great favour was being shown him . 
Many remained kneeling during the whole visit . 
Of those visitors , many had been men of high rank and learning , some even free thinkers , attracted by curiosity , but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy , for here there was no question of money , but only , on the one side love and kindness , and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some spiritual problem or crisis .

Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin , the divinity student , whom he knew almost intimately . 
He alone in the monastery knew Rakitin 's thoughts .
