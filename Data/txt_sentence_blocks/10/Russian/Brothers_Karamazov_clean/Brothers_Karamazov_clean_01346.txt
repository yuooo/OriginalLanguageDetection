`` How was it you came just now , eh ? 
Have you walked in ! 
... I was frightened . 
So you wanted to give me up to him , did you ? 
Did you really want to ? '' 
`` I did n't want to spoil your happiness ! '' 
Mitya faltered blissfully . 
But she did not need his answer . 
`` Well , go and enjoy yourself ... '' she sent him away once more . 
`` Do n't cry , I 'll call you back again . ''
