As though she were not worth it , when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness . 
Without her , without her gentle word it would be hell among us ! 
She softens even Varvara . 
And do n't judge Varvara harshly either , she is an angel too , she , too , has suffered wrong . 
She came to us for the summer , and she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up , to go back with to Petersburg in September , that is now . 
But we took her money and lived on it , so now she has nothing to go back with . 
Though indeed she could n't go back , for she has to work for us like a slave . 
She is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back . 
She waits on us all , mends and washes , sweeps the floor , puts mamma to bed . 
And mamma is capricious and tearful and insane !
