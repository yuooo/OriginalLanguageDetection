But we must one day begin life in sober earnest , we must look at ourselves as a society ; it 's time we tried to grasp something of our social position , or at least to make a beginning in that direction . 
`` A great writer * of the last epoch , comparing Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal , exclaims , ` Oh , troika , birdlike troika , who invented thee ! ' 
and adds , in proud ecstasy , that all the peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping troika to pass . 
That may be , they may stand aside , respectfully or no , but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in an excess of childish and naive optimism , or simply in fear of the censorship of the day . 
For if the troika were drawn by his heroes , Sobakevitch , Nozdryov , Tchitchikov , it could reach no rational goal , whoever might be driving it . 
And those were the heroes of an older generation , ours are worse specimens still ... '' * Gogol . 
At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch 's speech was interrupted by applause . 
The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated . 
The applause was , it 's true , of brief duration , so that the President did not think it necessary to caution the public , and only looked severely in the direction of the offenders . 
But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged ; he had never been applauded before !
