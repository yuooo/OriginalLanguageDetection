said Mitya . 
But before he had uttered the words , Vrublevsky , with a confused and infuriated face , shook his fist at Grushenka , shouting : `` You low harlot ! '' 
Mitya flew at him at once , clutched him in both hands , lifted him in the air , and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right , from which they had just come . 
`` I 've laid him on the floor , there , '' he announced , returning at once , gasping with excitement . 
`` He 's struggling , the scoundrel ! 
But he wo n't come back , no fear of that ! 
... '' He closed one half of the folding doors , and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole : `` Most illustrious , will you please to retire as well ? '' 
`` My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' said Trifon Borissovitch , `` make them give you back the money you lost . 
It 's as good as stolen from you . '' 
`` I do n't want my fifty roubles back , '' Kalgonov declared suddenly .
