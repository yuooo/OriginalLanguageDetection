Oh , I do not venture to repeat the details ; you have only just heard them . 
Honour , self-sacrifice were shown there , and I will be silent . 
The figure of the young officer , frivolous and profligate , doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal , was shown in a very sympathetic light before us . 
But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very court . 
Again I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so , but there were causes . 
The same lady , bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation , alleged that he , he of all men , had despised her for her action , which , though incautious , reckless perhaps , was still dictated by lofty and generous motives . 
He , he , the girl 's betrothed , looked at her with that smile of mockery , which was more insufferable from him than from anyone . 
And knowing that he had already deceived her -LRB- he had deceived her , believing that she was bound to endure everything from him , even treachery -RRB- , she intentionally offered him three thousand roubles , and clearly , too clearly , let him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her . 
` Well , will you take it or not , are you so lost to shame ? '
