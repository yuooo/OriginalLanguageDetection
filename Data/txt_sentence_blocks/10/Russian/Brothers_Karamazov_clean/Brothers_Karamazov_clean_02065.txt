`` You are angry with me even for being able to catch cold , though it happened in a most natural way . 
I was hurrying then to a diplomatic soiree at the house of a lady of high rank in Petersburg , who was aiming at influence in the Ministry . 
Well , an evening suit , white tie , gloves , though I was God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth ... . 
Of course , it took only an instant , but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight minutes , and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat . 
Spirits do n't freeze , but when one 's in fleshly form , well ... in brief , I did n't think , and set off , and you know in those ethereal spaces , in the water that is above the firmament , there 's such a frost ... at least one ca n't call it frost , you fancy , 150 degrees below zero ! 
You know the game the village girls play - they invite the unwary to lick an axe in thirty degrees of frost , the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off , so it bleeds . 
But that 's only in 30 degrees , in 150 degrees I imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the axe and it would be the end of it ... if only there could be an axe there . '' 
`` And can there be an axe there ? '' 
Ivan interrupted , carelessly and disdainfully . 
He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity `` An axe ? ''
