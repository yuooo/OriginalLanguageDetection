Smerdyakov sighed again and again . 
A trace of colour came into his face . 
`` If I was pleased , '' he articulated rather breathlessly , `` it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya . 
For it was nearer , anyway . 
Only when I said these words to you , it was not by way of praise , but of reproach . 
You did n't understand it . '' 
`` What reproach ? '' 
`` Why , that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father , and would not protect us , for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand . '' 
`` Damn you ! '' 
Ivan swore again .
