My mother began weeping , and , careful not to alarm my brother , she entreated him to go to church , to confess and take the sacrament , as he was still able to move about . 
This made him angry , and he said something profane about the church . 
He grew thoughtful , however ; he guessed at once that he was seriously ill , and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament . 
He had been aware , indeed , for a long time past , that he was far from well , and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to your mother and me , `` My life wo n't be long among you , I may not live another year , '' which seemed now like a prophecy . 
Three days passed and Holy Week had come . 
And on Tuesday morning my brother began going to church . 
`` I am doing this simply for your sake , mother , to please and comfort you , '' he said . 
My mother wept with joy and grief . 
`` His end must be near , '' she thought , `` if there 's such a change in him . '' 
But he was not able to go to church long , he took to his bed , so he had to confess and take the sacrament at home .
