When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell , he was struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it . 
This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety , in others by devout solemnity . 
All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately after the elder 's death . 
Their suspense was , from one point of view , almost frivolous , but even the most austere of the monks were affected by it . 
Father Paissy 's face looked the gravest of all . 
Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin , who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov . 
In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident . 
It appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima 's blessing , there had been an old woman from the town , a sergeant 's widow , called Prohorovna . 
She had inquired whether she might pray for the rest of the soul of her son , Vassenka , who had gone to Irkutsk , and had sent her no news for over a year . 
To which Father Zossima had answered sternly , forbidding her to do so , and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery .
