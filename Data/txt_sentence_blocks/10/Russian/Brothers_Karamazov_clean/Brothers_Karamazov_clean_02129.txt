And if he defended them , such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over Russia . 
There were stories , too , about our prosecutor and about the President of the Court . 
It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch , and that they had been enemies from the beginning of their careers in Petersburg , that though our sensitive prosecutor , who always considered that he had been aggrieved by someone in Petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated , was keenly excited over the Karamazov case , and was even dreaming of rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it , Fetyukovitch , they said , was his one anxiety . 
But these rumours were not quite just . 
Our prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger . 
On the contrary , his self-confidence increased with the increase of danger . 
It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly impressionable . 
He would put his whole soul into some case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result . 
This was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world , for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected from his modest position . 
People laughed particularly at his passion for psychology .
