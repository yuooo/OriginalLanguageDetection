The search angered , but encouraged him , the whole three thousand had not been found on him , only half of it . 
And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence , the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him . 
No doubt he was conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more likely , to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible . 
In such cases the first duty , the chief task of the investigating lawyers , is to prevent the criminal being prepared , to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity , improbability and inconsistency . 
The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact , of some circumstance of great importance in the case , of which he had no previous idea and could not have foreseen . 
We had such a fact in readiness - that was Grigory 's evidence about the open door through which the prisoner had run out . 
He had completely forgotten about that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it . 
`` The effect of it was amazing . 
He leapt up and shouted to us , ` Then Smerdyakov murdered him , it was Smerdyakov ! ' 
and so betrayed the basis of the defence he was keeping back , and betrayed it in its most improbable shape , for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had knocked Grigory down and run away .
