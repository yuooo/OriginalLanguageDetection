I love the people myself . 
I want to love them . 
And who could help loving them , our splendid Russian people , so simple in their greatness ! '' 
`` How is your daughter 's health ? 
You wanted to talk to me again ? '' 
`` Oh , I have been urgently begging for it , I have prayed for it ! 
I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until you let me in . 
We have come , great healer , to express our ardent gratitude . 
You have healed my Lise , healed her completely , merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her . 
We have hastened here to kiss those hands , to pour out our feelings and our homage . ''
