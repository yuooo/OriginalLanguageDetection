`` N - not particularly , '' answered Kolya carelessly . 
`` What 's blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose , '' he said , turning again to Ilusha - but though he assumed an unconcerned air as he talked , he still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up . 
`` Ah ! 
I heard about the goose ! '' 
Ilusha laughed , beaming all over . 
`` They told me , but I did n't understand . 
Did they really take you to the court ? '' 
`` The most stupid , trivial affair , they made a mountain of a mole-hill as they always do , '' Kolya began carelessly . 
`` I was walking through the market-place here one day , just when they 'd driven in the geese . 
I stopped and looked at them .
