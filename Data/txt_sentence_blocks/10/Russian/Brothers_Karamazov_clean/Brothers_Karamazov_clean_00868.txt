The sick man did not regain consciousness ; the convulsions ceased for a time , but then began again , and everyone concluded that the same thing would happen , as had happened a year before , when he accidently fell from the garret . 
They remembered that ice been put on his head then . 
There was still ice in the cellar , and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up . 
In the evening , Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube , who arrived at once . 
He was a most estimable old man , and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the province . 
After careful examination , he concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious consequences ; that meanwhile he , Herzenstube , did not fully understand it , but that by to-morrow morning , if the present remedies were unavailing , he would venture to try something else . 
The invalid was taken to the lodge , to a room next to Grigory 's and Marfa Ignatyevna 's . 
Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with that day . 
Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner , and the soup , compared with Smerdyakov 's , was `` no better than dish-water , '' and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it . 
To her master 's bitter , though deserved , reproaches , Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with , and that she had never been trained as a cook .
