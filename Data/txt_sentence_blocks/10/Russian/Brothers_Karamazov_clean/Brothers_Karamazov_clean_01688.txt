He was taken ill the same day , though for a month afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and passage . 
But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without help from his father . 
His father was terribly concerned about him . 
He even gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die . 
And often , especially after leading him round the room on his arm and putting him back to bed , he would run to a dark corner in the passage and , leaning his head against the wall , he would break into paroxysms of violent weeping , stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha . 
Returning to the room , he would usually begin doing something to amuse and comfort his precious boy : he would tell him stories , funny anecdotes , or would mimic comic people he had happened to meet , even imitate the howls and cries of animals . 
But Ilusha could not bear to see his father fooling and playing the buffoon . 
Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked it , he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt , and he was continually haunted by the memory of the `` wisp of tow '' and that `` terrible day . '' 
Nina , Ilusha 's gentle , crippled sister , did not like her father 's buffoonery either -LRB- Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg to study at the university -RRB- . 
But the half-imbecile mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or performing something .
