`` I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything , '' cried Mitya , with a joyful laugh . 
`` So I 've caught my Alyosha being Jesuitical . 
I must kiss you for that . 
Now listen to the rest ; I 'll open the other side of my heart to you . 
This is what I planned and decided . 
If I run away , even with money and a passport , and even to America , I should be cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure , not for happiness , but to another exile as bad , perhaps , as Siberia . 
It is as bad , Alyosha , it is ! 
I hate that America , damn it , already . 
Even though Grusha will be with me . 
Just look at her ; is she an American ?
