`` I must , I must get back to-night , '' he repeated , as he was jolted along in the cart , `` and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ... to draw up the deed . '' 
So mused Mitya , with a throbbing heart , but alas ! 
his dreams were not fated to be carried out . 
To begin with , he was late , taking a short cut from Volovya station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve . 
Secondly , he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe ; he had gone off to a neighbouring village . 
While Mitya , setting off there with the same exhausted horses , was looking for him , it was almost dark . 
The priest , a shy and amiable looking little man , informed him at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first , he was now at Suhoy Possyolok , that he was staying the night in the forester 's cottage , as he was buying timber there too . 
At Mitya 's urgent request that he would take him to Lyagavy at once , and by so doing `` save him , so to speak , '' the priest agreed , after some demur , to conduct him to Suhoy Possyolok ; his curiosity was obviously aroused . 
But , unluckily , he advised their going on foot , as it would not be `` much over '' a verst . 
Mitya , of course , agreed , and marched off with his yard-long strides , so that the poor priest almost ran after him .
