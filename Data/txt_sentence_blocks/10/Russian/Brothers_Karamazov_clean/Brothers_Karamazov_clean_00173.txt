`` He says that to his father ! 
his father What would he be with others ? 
Gentlemen , only fancy ; there 's a poor but honourable man living here , burdened with a numerous family , a captain who got into trouble and was discharged from the army , but not publicly , not by court-martial , with no slur on his honour . 
And three weeks ago , Dmitri seized him by the beard in a tavern , dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly , and all because he is an agent in a little business of mine . '' 
`` It 's all a lie ! 
Outwardly it 's the truth , but inwardly a lie ! '' 
Dmitri was trembling with rage . 
`` Father , I do n't justify my action . 
Yes , I confess it publicly , I behaved like a brute to that captain , and I regret it now , and I 'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage .
