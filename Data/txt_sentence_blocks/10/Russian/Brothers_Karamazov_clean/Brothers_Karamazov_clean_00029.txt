To Alyosha 's amazement this tomb turned out to be Grigory 's doing . 
He had put it up on the poor `` crazy woman 's '' grave at his own expense , after Fyodor Pavlovitch , whom he had often pestered about the grave , had gone to Odessa , abandoning the grave and all his memories . 
Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother 's grave . 
He only listened to Grigory 's minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb ; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word . 
It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again . 
But this little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch - and a very original one . 
He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife ; but not for the second , Alyosha 's mother , the `` crazy woman , '' but for the first , Adelaida Ivanovna , who used to thrash him . 
In the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha . 
He himself was far from being religious ; he had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint . 
Strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types .
