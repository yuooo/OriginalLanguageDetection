There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry . 
It withdraws into itself and is still . 
But there is a grief that breaks out , and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing . 
This is particularly common with women . 
But it is no lighter a grief than the silent . 
Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more . 
Such grief does not desire consolation . 
It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness . 
Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to re-open the wound . 
`` You are of the tradesman class ? ''
