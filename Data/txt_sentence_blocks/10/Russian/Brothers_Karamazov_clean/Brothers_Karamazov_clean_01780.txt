I have to look after him , too , just as though I kept an almshouse , '' she laughed . 
`` I do n't deserve your kindness . 
I am a worthless creature , '' said Maximov , with tears in his voice . 
`` You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me . '' 
`` Ech , everyone is of use , Maximushka , and how can we tell who 's of most use ? 
If only that Pole did n't exist , Alyosha . 
He 's taken it into his head to fall ill , too , to-day . 
I 've been to see him also . 
And I shall send him some pies , too , on purpose . 
I had n't sent him any , but Mitya accused me of it , so now I shall send some !
