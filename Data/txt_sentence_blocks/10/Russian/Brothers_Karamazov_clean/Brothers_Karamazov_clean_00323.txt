How can you break off the engagement if she , your betrothed , does n't want to ? '' 
`` Yes , formally and solemnly betrothed . 
It was all done on my arrival in Moscow , with great ceremony , with ikons , all in fine style . 
The general 's wife blessed us , and - would you believe it ? 
- congratulated Katya . 
You 've made a good choice , ' she said , ' I see right through him . ' 
And - would you believe it ? 
- she did n't like Ivan , and hardly greeted him . 
I had a lot of talk with Katya in Moscow . 
I told her about myself - sincerely , honourably .
