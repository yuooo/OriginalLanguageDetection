Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature . 
Oh , we shall persuade them at last not to be proud , for Thou didst lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud . 
We shall show them that they are weak , that they are only pitiful children , but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all . 
They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear , as chicks to the hen . 
They will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us , and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions . 
They will tremble impotently before our wrath , their minds will grow fearful , they will be quick to shed tears like women and children , but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and rejoicing , to happy mirth and childish song . 
Yes , we shall set them to work , but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a child 's game , with children 's songs and innocent dance . 
Oh , we shall allow them even sin , they are weak and helpless , and they will love us like children because we allow them to sin . 
We shall tell them that every sin will be expiated , if it is done with our permission , that we allow them to sin because we love them , and the punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves . 
And we shall take it upon ourselves , and they will adore us as their saviours who have taken on themselves their sins before God .
