Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed . 
`` Ilusha , I can show you another trick . 
I 've brought you a little cannon . 
You remember , I told you about it before and you said how much you 'd like to see it . 
Well , here , I 've brought it to you . '' 
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon . 
He hurried , because he was happy himself . 
Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off , now he hurried on , regardless of all consideration .
