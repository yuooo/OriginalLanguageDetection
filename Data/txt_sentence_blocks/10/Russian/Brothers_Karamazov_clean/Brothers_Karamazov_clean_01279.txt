Forgive me , Panie , '' he cried wildly , `` I flew here and vowed - Oh , do n't be afraid , it 's my last night ! 
Let 's drink to our good understanding . 
They 'll bring the wine at once ... . 
I brought this with me . '' 
-LRB- Something made him pull out his bundle of notes . -RRB- 
`` Allow me , panie ! 
I want to have music , singing , a revel , as we had before . 
But the worm , the unnecessary worm , will crawl away , and there 'll be no more of him . 
I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night . '' 
He was almost choking .
