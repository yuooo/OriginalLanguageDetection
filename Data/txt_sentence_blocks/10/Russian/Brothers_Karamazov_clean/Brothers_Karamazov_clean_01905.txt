Will they marry us ? 
If they do n't , I shall die of jealousy . 
I imagine something every day ... . 
What did she say to you about me ? '' 
Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day . 
Mitya listened , made him repeat things , and seemed pleased . 
`` Then she is not angry at my being jealous ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` She is a regular woman ! 
` I 've a fierce heart myself ! '
