One day he would come determined and say fervently : `` I know it will be heaven for me , heaven , the moment I confess . 
Fourteen years I 've been in hell . 
I want to suffer . 
I will take my punishment and begin to live . 
You can pass through the world doing wrong , but there 's no turning back . 
Now I dare not love my neighbour nor even my own children . 
Good God , my children will understand , perhaps , what my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me ! 
God is not in strength but in truth . '' 
`` All will understand your sacrifice , '' I said to him , `` if not at once , they will understand later ; for you have served truth , the higher truth , not of the earth . '' 
And he would go away seeming comforted , but next day he would come again , bitter , pale , sarcastic .
