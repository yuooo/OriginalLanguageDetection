`` Listen , you frivolous young woman , '' Krassotkin began , getting up from the sofa , `` can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides , that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence ? 
I am going out . '' 
`` And what am I going to swear for ? '' 
laughed Agafya . 
`` I shall look after them without that . '' 
`` No , you must swear on your eternal salvation . 
Else I sha n't go . '' 
`` Well , do n't then . 
What does it matter to me ? 
It 's cold out ; stay at home . ''
