I wo n't press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand , and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep in respectfully , though he knew the signals , and beat a retreat , leaving Smerdyakov his booty . 
Gentlemen of the jury , I put this question to you in earnest : when was the moment when Smerdyakov could have committed his crime ? 
Name that moment , or you ca n't accuse him . 
`` But , perhaps , the fit was a real one , the sick man suddenly recovered , heard a shout , and went out . 
Well - what then ? 
He looked about him and said , ` Why not go and kill the master ? ' 
And how did he know what had happened , since he had been lying unconscious till that moment ? 
But there 's a limit to these flights of fancy . '' 
` Quite so , ' some astute people will tell me , ` but what if they were in agreement ? 
What if they murdered him together and shared the money - what then ? '
