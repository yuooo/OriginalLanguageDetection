-LRB- It must be noted that I report this in my own words , the doctor made use of very learned and professional language . -RRB-

He laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh at . 
He showed continual and inexplicable irritability , using strange words , ` Bernard ! ' 
` Ethics ! ' 
and others equally inappropriate . ''

According to all accounts , he had even in the past , whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on , flown into a perfect frenzy , and yet he was reported to be a disinterested and not grasping man .
