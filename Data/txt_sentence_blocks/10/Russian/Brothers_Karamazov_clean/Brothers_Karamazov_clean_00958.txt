And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people . 
We are isolated only if the people are isolated . 
The people believe as we do , and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in Russia , even if he is sincere in heart and a genius . 
Remember that ! 
The people will meet the atheist and overcome him , and Russia will be one and orthodox . 
Take care of the peasant and guard his heart . 
Go on educating him quietly . 
That 's your duty as monks , for the peasant has God in his heart . 
-LRB- f -RRB- Of Masters and Servants , and of whether it is possible for them to be Brothers in the Spirit . 
Of course , I do n't deny that there is sin in the peasants too .
