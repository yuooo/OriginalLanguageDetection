It was said that they both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna , and that she only kept them with her as chaperons . 
Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one but her benefactress , the general 's widow , who had been kept by illness in Moscow , and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account of all her doings . 
When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to him to take his name up , it was evident that they were already aware of his arrival . 
Possibly he had been noticed from the window . 
At least , Alyosha heard a noise , caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling skirts . 
Two or three women , perhaps , had run out of the room . 
Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement . 
He was conducted , however , to the drawing-room at once . 
It was a large room , elegantly and amply furnished , not at all in provincial style . 
There were many sofas , lounges , settees , big and little tables .
