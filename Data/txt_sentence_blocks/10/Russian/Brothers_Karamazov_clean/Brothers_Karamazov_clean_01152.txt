You 've heard that Father Zossima is dead ? '' 
`` No , madam , it 's the first time I 've heard of it . '' 
Mitya was a little surprised . 
The image of Alyosha rose to his mind . 
`` Last night , and only imagine - '' `` Madam , '' said Mitya , `` I can imagine nothing except that I 'm in a desperate position , and that if you do n't help me , everything will come to grief , and I first of all . 
Excuse me for the triviality of the expression , but I 'm in a fever - '' `` I know , I know that you 're in a fever . 
You could hardly fail to be , and whatever you may say to me , I know beforehand . 
I have long been thinking over your destiny , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I am watching over it and studying it ... . 
Oh , believe me , I 'm an experienced doctor of the soul , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Madam , if you are an experienced doctor , I 'm certainly an experienced patient , '' said Mitya , with an effort to be polite , `` and I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way , you will come to my help in my ruin , and so allow me , at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you ... .
