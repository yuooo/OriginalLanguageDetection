Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya , but at once obediently did his bidding . 
Leading him into the passage , he went himself into the first large room , adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting , and took the light away . 
Then he stealthily led Mitya in , and put him in a corner in the dark , whence he could freely watch the company without being seen . 
But Mitya did not look long , and , indeed , he could not see them ; he saw her , his heart throbbed violently , and all was dark before his eyes . 
She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair , and beside her , on the sofa , was the pretty youth , Kalganov . 
She was holding his hand and seemed to be laughing , while he , seeming vexed and not looking at her , was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov , who sat the other side of the table , facing Grushenka . 
Maximov was laughing violently at something . 
On the sofa sat he , and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger . 
The one on the sofa was lolling backwards , smoking a pipe , and Mitya had an impression of a stoutish , broad-faced , short little man , who was apparently angry about something . 
His friend , the other stranger , struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall , but he could make out nothing more .
