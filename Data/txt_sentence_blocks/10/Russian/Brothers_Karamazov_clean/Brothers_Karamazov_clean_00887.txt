And there was a great deal more I do n't remember . 
I remember I went once into his room when there was no one else there . 
It was a bright evening , the sun was setting , and the whole room was lighted up . 
He beckoned me , and I went up to him . 
He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly , lovingly ; he said nothing for a minute , only looked at me like that . 
`` Well , '' he said , `` run and play now , enjoy life for me too . '' 
I went out then and ran to play . 
And many times in my life afterwards I remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too . 
There were many other marvellous and beautiful sayings of his , though we did not understand them at the time . 
He died the third week after Easter .
