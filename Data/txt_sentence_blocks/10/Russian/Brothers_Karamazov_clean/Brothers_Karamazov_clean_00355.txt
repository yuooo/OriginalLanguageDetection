When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it , his attitude to the boy seemed changed at once . 
Till then he had taken no notice of him , though he never scolded him , and always gave him a copeck when he met him . 
Sometimes , when he was in good humour , he would send the boy something sweet from his table . 
But as soon as he heard of his illness , he showed an active interest in him , sent for a doctor , and tried remedies , but the disease turned out to be incurable . 
The fits occurred , on an average , once a month , but at various intervals . 
The fits varied too , in violence : some were light and some were very severe . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy , and began allowing him to come upstairs to him . 
He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a time , too . 
One day when the boy was about fifteen , Fyodor Pavlovitch noticed him lingering by the bookcase , and reading the titles through the glass . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books - over a hundred - but no one ever saw him reading .
