He was a very cautious man , though not old . 
Mitya at once began talking to him , too , of his plans , nervously and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy , and talking all the way . 
The priest listened attentively , but gave little advice . 
He turned off Mitya 's questions with : `` I do n't know . 
Ah , I ca n't say . 
How can I tell ? '' 
and so on . 
When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his father over his inheritance , the priest was positively alarmed , as he was in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
He inquired , however , with surprise , why he called the peasant-trader Gorstkin , Lyagavy , and obligingly explained to Mitya that , though the man 's name really was Lyagavy , he was never called so , as he would be grievously offended at the name , and that he must be sure to call him Gorstkin , `` or you 'll do nothing with him ; he wo n't even listen to you , '' said the priest in conclusion . 
Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment , and explained that that was what Samsonov had called him .
