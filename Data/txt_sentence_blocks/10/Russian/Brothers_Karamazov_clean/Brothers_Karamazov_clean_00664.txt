I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to another town , we would give it to him , and , indeed , I myself would give him as much as he wanted out of my own money . 
That struck him all at once . 
Why , he thought , did I put myself forward to help him ? 
You know , Lise , it 's awfully hard for a man who has been injured , when other people look at him as though they were his benefactors ... . 
I 've heard that ; Father Zossima told me so . 
I do n't know how to put it , but I have often seen it myself . 
And I feel like that myself , too . 
And the worst of it was that though he did not know , to the very last minute , that he would trample on the notes , he had a kind of presentiment of it , I am sure of that . 
That 's just what made him so ecstatic , that he had that presentiment ... . 
And though it 's so dreadful , it 's all for the best .
