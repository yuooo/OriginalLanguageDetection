All because it was Karamazov , not Smerdyakov , he did n't think , he did n't reflect , and how should he ? 
He ran away ; he heard behind him the servant cry out ; the old man caught him , stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle . 
`` The prisoner , moved by pity , leapt down to look at him . 
Would you believe it , he tells us that he leapt down out of pity , out of compassion , to see whether he could do anything for him . 
Was that a moment to show compassion ? 
No ; he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or alive . 
Any other feeling , any other motive would be unnatural . 
Note that he took trouble over Grigory , wiped his head with his handkerchief and , convincing himself he was dead , he ran to the house of his mistress , dazed and covered with blood . 
How was it he never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once detected ? 
But the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice that he was covered with blood .
