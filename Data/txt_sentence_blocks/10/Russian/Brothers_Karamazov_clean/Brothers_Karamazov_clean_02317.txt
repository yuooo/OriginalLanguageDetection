As soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her side , promising him new happiness , oh ! 
then , I protest he must have felt the impulse to suicide doubled , trebled , and must have killed himself , if he had his father 's murder on his conscience . 
Oh , no ! 
he would not have forgotten where his pistols lay ! 
I know the prisoner : the savage , stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with his character . 
He would have killed himself , that 's certain . 
He did not kill himself just because ` his mother 's prayers had saved him , ' and he was innocent of his father 's blood . 
He was troubled , he was grieving that night at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would recover , that his blow had not been fatal , and that he would not have to suffer for it . 
Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts ? 
What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying ?
