I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character , the daughter of people much respected . 
They were well-to-do people of influence and position . 
They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception . 
I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favour and my heart was aflame at such an idea . 
Later on I saw and fully realised that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all , but only recognised the elevation of her mind and character , which I could not indeed have helped doing . 
I was prevented , however , from making her an offer at the time by my selfishness ; I was loath to part with the allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my youth , and with my pockets full of money . 
I did drop some hint as to my feelings however , though I put off taking any decisive step for a time . 
Then , all of a sudden , we were ordered off for two months to another district . 
On my return two months later , I found the young lady already married to a rich neighbouring landowner , a very amiable man , still young though older than I was , connected with the best Petersburg society , which I was not , and of excellent education , which I also was not . 
I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded .
