Why do you trouble his happiness ? 
He is living , for the soul lives for ever , and though he is not in the house he is near you , unseen . 
How can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to you ? 
To whom is he to go if he find you not together , his father and mother ? 
He comes to you in dreams now , and you grieve . 
But then he will send you gentle dreams . 
Go to your husband , mother ; go this very day . '' 
`` I will go , Father , at your word . 
I will go . 
You 've gone straight to my heart .
