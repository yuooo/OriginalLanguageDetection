He will be horror-stricken ; he will be crushed by remorse and the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth . 
And he will not say then , ' I am quits , ' but will say , ' I am guilty in the sight of all men and am more unworthy than all . ' 
With tears of penitence and poignant , tender anguish , he will exclaim : ` Others are better than I , they wanted to save me , not to ruin me ! ' 
Oh , this act of mercy is so easy for you , for in the absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce : ` Yes , he is guilty . ' 
`` Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man ! 
Do you hear , do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious history ? 
It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment only , but also for the salvation of the criminal ! 
Let other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law , we will cling to the spirit and the meaning - the salvation and the reformation of the lost . 
If this is true , if Russia and her justice are such , she may go forward with good cheer ! 
Do not try to scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust .
