In such cases I am always against the woman , against all these feminine tears and hysterics . 
Run and say , Yulia , that I 'll fly to her . 
As for Ivan Fyodorovitch 's going away like that , it 's her own fault . 
But he wo n't go away . 
Lise , for mercy 's sake , do n't scream ! 
Oh , yes ; you are not screaming . 
It 's I am screaming . 
Forgive your mamma ; but I am delighted , delighted , delighted ! 
Did you notice , Alexey Fyodorovitch , how young , how young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out , when he said all that and went out ? 
I thought he was so learned , such a savant , and all of a sudden he behaved so warmly , openly , and youthfully , with such youthful inexperience , and it was all so fine , like you ... .
