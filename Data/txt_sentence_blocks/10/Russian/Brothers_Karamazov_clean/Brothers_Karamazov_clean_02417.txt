he cried suddenly in dismay . 
But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his pocket . 
He instantly pulled it out and was reassured . 
`` Ilusha told me to , Ilusha , '' he explained at once to Alyosha . 
`` I was sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me : ` Father , when my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly down ; I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone . ' '' 
`` That 's a good thing , '' said Alyosha , `` we must often take some . '' 
`` Every day , every day ! '' 
said the captain quickly , seeming cheered at the thought . 
They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it . 
The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so , all through the service .
