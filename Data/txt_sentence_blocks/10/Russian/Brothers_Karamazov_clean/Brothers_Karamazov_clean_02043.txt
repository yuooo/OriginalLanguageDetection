Ivan rose from his seat . 
`` I repeat , '' he said , `` the only reason I have n't killed you is that I need you for to-morrow , remember that , do n't forget it ! '' 
`` Well , kill me . 
Kill me now , '' Smerdyakov said , all at once looking strangely at Ivan . 
`` You wo n't dare do that even ! '' 
he added , with a bitter smile . 
`` You wo n't dare to do anything , you , who used to be so bold ! '' 
`` Till to-morrow , '' cried Ivan , and moved to go out . 
`` Stay a moment ... . 
Show me those notes again . ''
