` Give me back my nose ! ' 
he said , and he beat his breast . 
` My son , ' said the priest evasively , ` all things are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence , and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary , though unapparent , benefits . 
If stern destiny has deprived you of your nose , it 's to your advantage that no one can ever pull you by your nose . ' 
` Holy father , that 's no comfort , ' cried the despairing marquis . 
` I 'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every day of my life , if it were only in its proper place . ' 
` My son , ' sighs the priest , ` you ca n't expect every blessing at once . 
This is murmuring against Providence , who even in this has not forgotten you , for if you repine as you repined just now , declaring you 'd be glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life , your desire has already been fulfilled indirectly , for when you lost your nose , you were led by the nose . ' 
`` Fool , how stupid ! '' 
cried Ivan .
