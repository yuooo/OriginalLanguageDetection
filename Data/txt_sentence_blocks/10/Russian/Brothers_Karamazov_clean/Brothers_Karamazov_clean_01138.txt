Another time Mitya might have killed the fool in a fury , but now he felt as weak as a child . 
He went quietly to the bench , took up his overcoat , put it on without a word , and went out of the hut . 
He did not find the forester in the next room ; there was no one there . 
He took fifty copecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the table for his night 's lodging , the candle , and the trouble he had given . 
Coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round . 
He walked at hazard , not knowing which way to turn out of the hut , to the right or to the left . 
Hurrying there the evening before with the priest , he had not noticed the road . 
He had no revengeful feeling for anybody , even for Samsonov , in his heart . 
He strode along a narrow forest path , aimless , dazed , without heeding where he was going . 
A child could have knocked him down , so weak was he in body and soul .
