`` You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my opponent 's forgiveness , '' I answered ; `` but I had better tell you from the beginning what I have not yet told anyone else . '' 
And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me , and how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet . 
`` From that you can see for yourself , '' I concluded , `` that at the time of the duel it was easier for me , for I had made a beginning already at home , and when once I had started on that road , to go farther along it was far from being difficult , but became a source of joy and happiness . '' 
I liked the way he looked at me as he listened . 
`` All that , '' he said , `` is exceedingly interesting . 
I will come to see you again and again . '' 
And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening . 
And we should have become greater friends , if only he had ever talked of himself . 
But about himself he scarcely ever said a word , yet continually asked me about myself .
