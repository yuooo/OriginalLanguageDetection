So you want to be a monk ? 
And do you know I 'm sorry to lose you , Alyosha ; would you believe it , I 've really grown fond of you ? 
Well , it 's a good opportunity . 
You 'll pray for us sinners ; we have sinned too much here . 
I 've always been thinking who would pray for me , and whether there 's anyone in the world to do it . 
My dear boy , I 'm awfully stupid about that . 
You would n't believe it . 
Awfully . 
You see , however stupid I am about it , I keep thinking , I keep thinking - from time to time , of course , not all the while . 
It 's impossible , I think , for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die .
