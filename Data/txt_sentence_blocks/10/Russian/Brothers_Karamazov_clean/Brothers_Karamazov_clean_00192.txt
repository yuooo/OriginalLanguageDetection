Alyosha believed that implicitly . 
But how could he go ? 
He had told him not to weep , and to leave the monastery . 
Good God ! 
It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish . 
He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage , and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts , he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path . 
He had not far to go - about five hundred paces . 
He expected to meet no one at that hour , but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin . 
He was waiting for someone . 
`` Are you waiting for me ? ''
