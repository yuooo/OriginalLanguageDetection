It took my breath away ; then I suddenly thought : ` If he comes and whistles to call me , I shall creep back to him like a beaten dog . ' 
I could n't believe myself . 
Am I so abject ? 
Shall I run to him or not ? 
And I 've been in such a rage with myself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago . 
Do you see now , Alyosha , what a violent , vindictive creature I am ? 
I have shown you the whole truth ! 
I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that other . 
Hush , Rakitin , it 's not for you to judge me , I am not speaking to you . 
Before you came in , I was lying here waiting , brooding , deciding my whole future life , and you can never know what was in my heart .
