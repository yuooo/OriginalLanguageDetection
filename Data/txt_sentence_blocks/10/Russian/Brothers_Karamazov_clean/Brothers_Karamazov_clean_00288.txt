I ca n't endure the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom . 
What 's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna , and his heart may be on fire with that ideal , genuinely on fire , just as in his days of youth and innocence . 
Yes , man is broad , too broad , indeed . 
I 'd have him narrower . 
The devil only knows what to make of it ! 
What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart . 
Is there beauty in Sodom ? 
Believe me , that for the immense mass of mankind beauty is found in Sodom . 
Did you know that secret ? 
The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible .
