After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the drawing-room , and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once . 
This younger son , a man over six foot and of exceptional physical strength , who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style , though his father still wore a kaftan and a beard , came at once without a comment . 
All the family trembled before the father . 
The old man had sent for this giant , not because he was afraid of the `` captain '' -LRB- he was by no means of a timorous temper -RRB- , but in order to have a witness in case of any emergency . 
Supported by his son and the servant lad , he waddled at last into the drawing-room . 
It may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity . 
The drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast , dreary room that laid a weight of depression on the heart . 
It had a double row of windows , a gallery , marbled walls , and three immense chandeliers with glass lustres covered with shades . 
Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance , awaiting his fate with nervous impatience . 
When the old man appeared at the opposite door , seventy feet away , Mitya jumped up at once , and with his long , military stride walked to meet him .
