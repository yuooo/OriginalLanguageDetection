`` But he was unfair to me , unfair to me about lots of things . 
He told lies about me to my face . 
` Oh , you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue : to confess you murdered your father , that the valet murdered him at your instigation . ' '' 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha interposed , `` restrain yourself . 
It was not you murdered him . 
It 's not true ! '' 
`` That 's what he says , he , and he knows it . 
` You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue , and you do n't believe in virtue ; that 's what tortures you and makes you angry , that 's why you are so vindictive . ' 
He said that to me about me and he knows what he says . '' 
`` It 's you say that , not he , '' exclaimed Alyosha mournfully , `` and you say it because you are ill and delirious , tormenting yourself . ''
