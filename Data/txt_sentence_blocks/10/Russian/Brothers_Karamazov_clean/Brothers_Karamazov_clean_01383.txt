`` Grusha , you wanted to be honest , but I 'm a thief . 
But I 've stolen money from Katya ... . 
Disgrace , a disgrace ! '' 
`` From Katya , from that young lady ? 
No , you did n't steal it . 
Give it back to her , take it from me ... . 
Why make a fuss ? 
Now everything of mine is yours . 
What does money matter ? 
We shall waste it anyway ... .
