Of things beside which the present case grows pale , and seems almost commonplace . 
But what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil , now so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it . 
`` One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society , at the very outset of his career , in a cowardly underhand way , without a pang of conscience , murdering an official who had once been his benefactor , and the servant girl , to steal his own I O U and what ready money he could find on him ; ` it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future . ' 
After murdering them , he puts pillows under the head of each of his victims ; he goes away . 
Next , a young hero ` decorated for bravery ' kills the mother of his chief and benefactor , like a highwayman , and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that ` she loves him like a son , and so will follow all his directions and take no precautions . ' 
Granted that he is a monster , yet I dare not say in these days that he is unique . 
Another man will not commit the murder , but will feel and think like him , and is as dishonourable in soul . 
In silence , alone with his conscience , he asks himself perhaps , ` What is honour , and is n't the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice ? ' 
`` Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid , hysterical , that it is a monstrous slander , that I am exaggerating . 
Let them say so - and heavens !
