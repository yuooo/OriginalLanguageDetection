`` And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness herself ? ' 
Mitya exclaimed bitterly again . 
`` Mitya , do n't dare to blame her ; you have no right to ! '' 
Alyosha cried hotly . 
`` Her proud lips spoke , not her heart , '' Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust . 
`` If she saves you I 'll forgive her everything - '' She stopped speaking , as though suppressing something . 
She could not yet recover herself . 
She had come in , as appeared afterwards , accidentally , with no suspicion of what she would meet . 
`` Alyosha , run after her ! '' 
Mitya cried to his brother ; `` tell her ... I do n't know ... do n't let her go away like this ! ''
