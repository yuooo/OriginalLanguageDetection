`` It 's incomprehensible . '' 
`` I wonder at you . 
But I 'll make it clearer . 
Perhaps it really is incomprehensible . 
You see , attend to what I say . 
I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honour ; I spend it on a spree , say I spend it all , and next morning I go to her and say , ` Katya , I 've done wrong , I 've squandered your three thousand ' ; well , is that right ? 
No , it 's not right - it 's dishonest and cowardly ; I 'm a beast , with no more self-control than a beast , that 's so , is n't it ? 
But still I 'm not a thief ? 
Not a downright thief , you 'll admit ! 
I squandered it , but I did n't steal it .
