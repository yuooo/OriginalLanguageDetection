She , too , was dressed entirely in black , with her magnificent black shawl on her shoulders . 
She walked to the witness-box with her smooth , noiseless tread , with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure . 
She looked steadily at the President , turning her eyes neither to the right nor to the left . 
To my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment , and not at all pale , as the ladies alleged afterwards . 
They declared , too , that she had a concentrated and spiteful expression . 
I believe that she was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public . 
She was proud and could not stand contempt . 
She was one of those people who flare up , angry and eager to retaliate , at the mere suggestion of contempt . 
There was an element of timidity , too , of course , and inward shame at her own timidity , so it was not strange that her tone kept changing . 
At one moment it was angry , contemptuous and rough , and at another there was a sincere note of self-condemnation .
