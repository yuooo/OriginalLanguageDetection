The prosecutor struck me and the others , too , as looking particularly pale , almost green . 
His face seemed to have grown suddenly thinner , perhaps in a single night , for I had seen him looking as usual only two days before . 
The President began with asking the court whether all the jury were present . 
But I see I ca n't go on like this , partly because some things I did not hear , others I did not notice , and others I have forgotten , but most of all because , as I have said before , I have literally no time or space to mention everything that was said and done . 
I only know that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen . 
I remember the twelve jurymen - four were petty officials of the town , two were merchants , and six peasants and artisans of the town . 
I remember , long before the trial , questions were continually asked with some surprise , especially by ladies : `` Can such a delicate , complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to petty officials and even peasants ? '' 
and `` What can an official , still more a peasant , understand in such an affair ? '' 
All the four officials in the jury were , in fact , men of no consequence and of low rank . 
Except one who was rather younger , they were grey-headed men , little known in society , who had vegetated on a pitiful salary , and who probably had elderly , unpresentable wives and crowds of children , perhaps even without shoes and stockings .
