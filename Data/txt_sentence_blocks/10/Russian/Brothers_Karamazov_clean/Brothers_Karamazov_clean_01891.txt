Alyosha , my angel , all these philosophies are the death of me . 
Damn them ! 
Brother Ivan - '' `` What of brother Ivan ? ''

`` You see , I never had any of these doubts before , but it was all hidden away in me . 
It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were surging up in me , that I used to drink and fight and rage . 
It was to stifle them in myself , to still them , to smother them . 
Ivan is not Rakitin , there is an idea in him . 
Ivan is a sphinx and is silent ; he is always silent .
