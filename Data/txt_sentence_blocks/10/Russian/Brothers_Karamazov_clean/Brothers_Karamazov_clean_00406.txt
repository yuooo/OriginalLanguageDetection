Damn it ! 
My mind has never been so darkened before . 
Excuse me , why , I was thinking Ivan ... He he he ! '' 
He stopped . 
A broad , drunken , half senseless grin overspread his face . 
At that moment a fearful noise , and clamour was heard in the hall , there were violent shouts , the door was flung open , and Dmitri burst into the room . 
The old man rushed to Ivan in terror . 
`` He 'll kill me ! 
He 'll kill me ! 
Do n't let him get at me ! ''
