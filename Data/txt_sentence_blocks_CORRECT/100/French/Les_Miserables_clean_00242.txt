leave us alone ! '' 
`` It 's the hour for foxes , not for chickens , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` You see the job we have on hand here , '' added Babet . 
Eponine caught Montparnasse 's hand . 
`` Take care , '' said he , `` you 'll cut yourself , I 've a knife open . '' 
`` My little Montparnasse , '' responded Eponine very gently , `` you must have confidence in people . 
I am the daughter of my father , perhaps . 
Monsieur Babet , Monsieur Guelemer , I 'm the person who was charged to investigate this matter . '' 
It is remarkable that Eponine did not talk slang . 
That frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she had known Marius . 
She pressed in her hand , small , bony , and feeble as that of a skeleton , Guelemer 's huge , coarse fingers , and continued : -- `` You know well that I 'm no fool . 
Ordinarily , I am believed . 
I have rendered you service on various occasions . 
Well , I have made inquiries ; you will expose yourselves to no purpose , you see . 
I swear to you that there is nothing in this house . '' 
`` There are lone women , '' said Guelemer . 
`` No , the persons have moved away . '' 
`` The candles have n't , anyway ! '' 
ejaculated Babet . 
And he pointed out to Eponine , across the tops of the trees , a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion . 
It was Toussaint , who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry . 
Eponine made a final effort . 
`` Well , '' said she , `` they 're very poor folks , and it 's a hovel where there is n't a sou . '' 
`` Go to the devil ! '' 
cried Thenardier . 
`` When we 've turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below , we 'll tell you what there is inside , and whether it 's francs or sous or half-farthings . '' 
And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering . 
`` My good friend , Mr. Montparnasse , '' said Eponine , `` I entreat you , you are a good fellow , do n't enter . '' 
`` Take care , you 'll cut yourself , '' replied Montparnasse . 
Thenardier resumed in his decided tone : -- `` Decamp , my girl , and leave men to their own affairs ! '' 
Eponine released Montparnasse 's hand , which she had grasped again , and said : -- `` So you mean to enter this house ? '' 
`` Rather ! '' 
grinned the ventriloquist . 
Then she set her back against the gate , faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth , and to whom the night lent the visages of demons , and said in a firm , low voice : -- `` Well , I do n't mean that you shall . '' 
They halted in amazement . 
The ventriloquist , however , finished his grin . 
She went on : -- `` Friends ! 
Listen well . 
This is not what you want . 
Now I 'm talking . 
In the first place , if you enter this garden , if you lay a hand on this gate , I 'll scream , I 'll beat on the door , I 'll rouse everybody , I 'll have the whole six of you seized , I 'll call the police . '' 
`` She 'd do it , too , '' said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon and the ventriloquist . 
She shook her head and added : -- `` Beginning with my father ! '' 
Thenardier stepped nearer . 
`` Not so close , my good man ! '' 
said she . 
He retreated , growling between his teeth : -- `` Why , what 's the matter with her ? '' 
And he added : -- `` Bitch ! '' 
She began to laugh in a terrible way : -- `` As you like , but you shall not enter here . 
I 'm not the daughter of a dog , since I 'm the daughter of a wolf . 
There are six of you , what matters that to me ? 
You are men . 
Well , I 'm a woman . 
You do n't frighten me . 
I tell you that you sha n't enter this house , because it does n't suit me . 
If you approach , I 'll bark . 
I told you , I 'm the dog , and I do n't care a straw for you . 
Go your way , you bore me ! 
Go where you please , but do n't come here , I forbid it ! 
You can use your knives . 
I 'll use kicks ; it 's all the same to me , come on ! '' 
She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians , she was terrible , she burst out laughing : -- `` Pardine ! 
I 'm not afraid . 
I shall be hungry this summer , and I shall be cold this winter . 
Are n't they ridiculous , these ninnies of men , to think they can scare a girl ! 
What ! 
Scare ? 
Oh , yes , much ! 
Because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice , forsooth ! 
I ai n't afraid of anything , that I ai n't ! '' 
She fastened her intent gaze upon Thenardier and said : -- `` Not even of you , father ! '' 
Then she continued , as she cast her blood-shot , spectre-like eyes upon the ruffians in turn : -- `` What do I care if I 'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of the Rue Plumet , killed by the blows of my father 's club , or whether I 'm found a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs ? '' 
She was forced to pause ; she was seized by a dry cough , her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle . 
She resumed : -- `` I have only to cry out , and people will come , and then slap , bang ! 
There are six of you ; I represent the whole world . '' 
Thenardier made a movement towards her . 
`` Do n't approach ! '' 
she cried . 
He halted , and said gently : -- `` Well , no ; I wo n't approach , but do n't speak so loud . 
So you intend to hinder us in our work , my daughter ? 
But we must earn our living all the same . 
Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father ? '' 
`` You bother me , '' said Eponine . 
`` But we must live , we must eat -- '' `` Burst ! '' 
So saying , she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed : -- `` Mon bras si dodu , `` My arm so plump , Ma jambe bien faite My leg well formed , Et le temps perdu . '' 
And time wasted . '' 
She had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand , and she swung her foot with an air of indifference . 
Her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder-blades . 
The neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude . 
Nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen . 
The six rascals , speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl , retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern , and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs . 
In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air . 
`` There 's something the matter with her , '' said Babet . 
`` A reason . 
Is she in love with the dog ? 
It 's a shame to miss this , anyway . 
Two women , an old fellow who lodges in the back-yard , and curtains that ai n't so bad at the windows . 
The old cove must be a Jew . 
I think the job 's a good one . '' 
`` Well , go in , then , the rest of you , '' exclaimed Montparnasse .
