If I remain a moment longer , I shall most likely faint . 
I request your majesty 's permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes . '' 
`` Indeed , you are in a shiver ; it is painful to behold ! 
Come , Monsieur Fouquet , begone ! 
I will send to inquire after you . '' 
`` Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness . 
In an hour I shall be better . '' 
`` I will call some one to reconduct you , '' said the king . 
`` As you please , sire ; I would gladly take the arm of any one . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , ringing his little bell . 
`` Oh , sire , '' interrupted Fouquet , laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold , `` would you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings ? 
An equivocal honor that , sire ! 
A simple footman , I beg . '' 
`` And why , M. Fouquet ? 
M. d'Artagnan conducts me often , and extremely well ! '' 
`` Yes , but when he conducts you , sire , it is to obey you ; whilst me - '' `` Go on ! '' 
`` If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers , it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
replied the king , who became paler than Fouquet himself , - `` arrested ! 
oh ! '' 
`` And why should they not say so ? '' 
continued Fouquet , still laughing ; `` and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it . '' 
This sally disconcerted the monarch . 
Fouquet was skillful enough , or fortunate enough , to make Louis XIV . 
recoil before the appearance of the deed he meditated . 
M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed , without at all comprehending what was going on . 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment , affecting all the slowness of a man who walks with difficulty . 
When once out of the castle , `` I am saved ! '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , disloyal king , you shall see Belle-Isle , but it shall be when I am no longer there . '' 
He disappeared , leaving D'Artagnan with the king . 
`` Captain , '' said the king , `` you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` He is going to his lodgings again . 
You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . '' 
`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed . 
`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . '' 
`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by . 
So much the worse ! 
Now I have orders , I will obey those orders , and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested . 
He is at the castle of Angers , this very M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you have not got him yet , captain . '' 
`` That concerns me ; every one to his trade , sire ; only , once more , reflect ! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet , sire ? '' 
`` Yes , a thousand times , yes ! '' 
`` In writing , sire , then . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
D'Artagnan read it , bowed to the king , and left the room . 
From the height of the terrace he perceived Gourville , who went by with a joyous air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
: The White Horse and the Black . 
`` That is rather surprising , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` Gourville running about the streets so gayly , when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger ; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace , and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant . 
Gourville is rubbing his hands ; that is because he has done something clever . 
Whence comes M. Gourville ? 
Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes . 
Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead ? '' 
And D'Artagnan followed , along the tops of the houses of Nantes , dominated by the castle , the line traced by the streets , as he would have done upon a topographical plan ; only , instead of the dead , flat paper , the living chart rose in relief with the cries , the movements , and the shadows of men and things . 
Beyond the inclosure of the city , the great verdant plains stretched out , bordering the Loire , and appeared to run towards the pink horizon , which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of the marshes .
