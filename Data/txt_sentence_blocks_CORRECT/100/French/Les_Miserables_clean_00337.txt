And you wo n't live with us ! 
And you wo n't have my chamber ! 
What have I done to you ? 
Has anything happened ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Well then ? '' 
`` Everything is as usual . '' 
`` Why do you change your name ? '' 
`` You have changed yours , surely . '' 
He smiled again with the same smile as before and added : `` Since you are Madame Pontmercy , I certainly can be Monsieur Jean . '' 
`` I do n't understand anything about it . 
All this is idiotic . 
I shall ask permission of my husband for you to be ` Monsieur Jean . ' 
I hope that he will not consent to it . 
You cause me a great deal of pain . 
One does have freaks , but one does not cause one 's little Cosette grief . 
That is wrong . 
You have no right to be wicked , you who are so good . '' 
He made no reply . 
She seized his hands with vivacity , and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement , she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin , which is a gesture of profound tenderness . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she said to him , `` be good ! '' 
And she went on : `` This is what I call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father . '' 
He loosed her hands . 
`` You no longer need a father , you have a husband . '' 
Cosette became angry . 
`` I no longer need a father ! 
One really does not know what to say to things like that , which are not common sense ! '' 
`` If Toussaint were here , '' resumed Jean Valjean , like a person who is driven to seek authorities , and who clutches at every branch , `` she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own . 
There is nothing new in this . 
I always have loved my black corner . '' 
`` But it is cold here . 
One can not see distinctly . 
It is abominable , that it is , to wish to be Monsieur Jean ! 
I will not have you say ` you ' to me . 
`` Just now , as I was coming hither , '' replied Jean Valjean , `` I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis . 
It was at a cabinet-maker 's . 
If I were a pretty woman , I would treat myself to that bit of furniture . 
A very neat toilet table in the reigning style . 
What you call rosewood , I think . 
It is inlaid . 
The mirror is quite large . 
There are drawers . 
It is pretty . '' 
`` Hou ! 
the villainous bear ! '' 
replied Cosette . 
And with supreme grace , setting her teeth and drawing back her lips , she blew at Jean Valjean . 
She was a Grace copying a cat . 
`` I am furious , '' she resumed . 
`` Ever since yesterday , you have made me rage , all of you . 
I am greatly vexed . 
I do n't understand . 
You do not defend me against Marius . 
Marius will not uphold me against you . 
I am all alone . 
I arrange a chamber prettily . 
If I could have put the good God there I would have done it . 
My chamber is left on my hands . 
My lodger sends me into bankruptcy . 
I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette . 
We will have nothing to do with your dinner , Madame . 
And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him ` Monsieur Jean , ' and to receive him in a frightful , old , ugly cellar , where the walls have beards , and where the crystal consists of empty bottles , and the curtains are of spiders ' webs ! 
You are singular , I admit , that is your style , but people who get married are granted a truce . 
You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly . 
So you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme . 
I was very desperate indeed there , that I was . 
What have you against me ? 
You cause me a great deal of grief . 
Fi ! '' 
And , becoming suddenly serious , she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and added : `` Are you angry with me because I am happy ? '' 
Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep . 
This question , which was simple for Cosette , was profound for Jean Valjean . 
Cosette had meant to scratch , and she lacerated . 
Jean Valjean turned pale . 
He remained for a moment without replying , then , with an inexpressible intonation , and speaking to himself , he murmured : `` Her happiness was the object of my life . 
Now God may sign my dismissal . 
Cosette , thou art happy ; my day is over . '' 
`` Ah , you have said thou to me ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette . 
And she sprang to his neck . 
Jean Valjean , in bewilderment , strained her wildly to his breast . 
It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back . 
`` Thanks , father ! '' 
said Cosette . 
This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean Valjean . 
He gently removed Cosette 's arms , and took his hat . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Cosette . 
`` I leave you , Madame , they are waiting for you . '' 
And , from the threshold , he added : `` I have said thou to you . 
Tell your husband that this shall not happen again . 
Pardon me . '' 
Jean Valjean quitted the room , leaving Cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell . 
ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS On the following day , at the same hour , Jean Valjean came . 
Cosette asked him no questions , was no longer astonished , no longer exclaimed that she was cold , no longer spoke of the drawing-room , she avoided saying either `` father '' or `` Monsieur Jean . '' 
She allowed herself to be addressed as you . 
She allowed herself to be called Madame . 
Only , her joy had undergone a certain diminution . 
She would have been sad , if sadness had been possible to her .
