A little , ' I replied , bending a little in my hands , ` but I could hold out for an hour or so longer . ' '' 
` No , no , I will not allow it ; the willing fellows will make it a duty to support your arms , as of old , men supported those of the prophet . ' '' 
` Very good , ' I answered . '' 
` That will not be humiliating to you ? ' '' 
` My friend , ' said I , ` there is , I think , a great difference between being supported and being measured . ' '' 
`` The distinction is full of the soundest sense , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Then , '' continued Porthos , `` he made a sign : two lads approached ; one supported my left arm , while the other , with infinite address , supported my right . '' '' 
` Another , my man , ' cried he . 
A third approached . 
` Support monsieur by the waist , ' said he . 
The garcon complied . '' 
`` So that you were at rest ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Perfectly ; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass . '' 
`` Poquelin , my friend . '' 
`` Poquelin - you are right . 
Stay , decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere . '' 
`` Yes ; and then it was over , was n't it ? '' 
`` During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror . '' '' 
'T was delicate in him . '' 
`` I much like the plan ; it is respectful , and keeps every one in his place . '' 
`` And there it ended ? '' 
`` Without a soul having touched me , my friend . '' 
`` Except the three garcons who supported you . '' 
`` Doubtless ; but I have , I think , already explained to you the difference there is between supporting and measuring . '' '' 
'T is true , '' answered D'Artagnan ; who said afterwards to himself , `` I ` faith , I greatly deceive myself , or I have been the means of a good windfall to that rascal Moliere , and we shall assuredly see the scene hit off to the life in some comedy or other . '' 
Porthos smiled . 
`` What are you laughing at ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Must I confess ? 
Well , I was laughing over my good fortune . '' 
`` Oh , that is true ; I do n't know a happier man than you . 
But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you ? ' 
`` Well , my dear fellow , congratulate me . '' 
`` I desire nothing better . '' 
`` It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that manner . '' 
`` Are you so sure of it ? ' 
`` Nearly so . 
Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere and the other garcons showed me the fact . '' 
`` Well , my friend , that does not surprise me from Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . '' 
`` Wo n't it be of use to him , indeed ? 
I believe you , it will , and that in the highest degree ; - for you see my friend Moliere is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons , comtes , and marquises - according to their measure . '' 
On this observation , neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss , D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin 's house and rejoined their carriages , wherein we will leave them , in order to look after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande . 
: The Bee-Hive , the Bees , and the Honey . 
The bishop of Vannes , much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin 's , returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor . 
Moliere , on the other hand , quite delighted at having made such a capital rough sketch , and at knowing where to find his original again , whenever he should desire to convert his sketch into a picture , Moliere arrived in the merriest of moods . 
All the first story of the left wing was occupied by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris , and those on the freest footing in the house - every one in his compartment , like the bees in their cells , employed in producing the honey intended for that royal cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV . 
during the fete at Vaux . 
Pelisson , his head leaning on his hand , was engaged in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the `` Facheux , '' a comedy in three acts , which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere , as D'Artagnan called him , or Coquelin de Voliere , as Porthos styled him . 
Loret , with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer , - the gazetteers of all ages have always been so artless ! 
- Loret was composing an account of the fetes at Vaux , before those fetes had taken place . 
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other , a peripatetic , absent - minded , boring , unbearable dreamer , who kept buzzing and humming at everybody 's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions . 
He so often disturbed Pelisson , that the latter , raising his head , crossly said , `` At least , La Fontaine , supply me with a rhyme , since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus . '' 
`` What rhyme do you want ? '' 
asked the Fabler as Madame de Sevigne used to call him . 
`` I want a rhyme to lumiere . '' 
`` Orniere , '' answered La Fontaine . 
`` Ah , but , my good friend , one can not talk of wheel-ruts when celebrating the delights of Vaux , '' said Loret . 
`` Besides , it does n't rhyme , '' answered Pelisson . 
`` What ! 
does n't rhyme ! '' 
cried La Fontaine , in surprise . 
`` Yes ; you have an abominable habit , my friend , - a habit which will ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order . 
You rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , oh , you think so , do you , Pelisson ? '' 
`` Yes , I do , indeed . 
Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can find a better . '' 
`` Then I will never write anything again save in prose , '' said La Fontaine , who had taken up Pelisson 's reproach in earnest . 
`` Ah ! 
I often suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet ! 
Yes , 't is the very truth . '' 
`` Do not say so ; your remark is too sweeping , and there is much that is good in your ` Fables . ' '' 
`` And to begin , '' continued La Fontaine , following up his idea , `` I will go and burn a hundred verses I have just made . '' 
`` Where are your verses ? '' 
`` In my head . '' 
`` Well , if they are in your head you can not burn them . '' 
`` True , '' said La Fontaine ; `` but if I do not burn them - '' `` Well , what will happen if you do not burn them ? '' 
`` They will remain in my mind , and I shall never forget them ! '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
cried Loret ; `` what a dangerous thing ! 
One would go mad with it ! '' 
`` The deuce ! 
the deuce ! '' 
repeated La Fontaine ; `` what can I do ? '' 
`` I have discovered the way , '' said Moliere , who had entered just at this point of the conversation . 
`` What way ? '' 
`` Write them first and burn them afterwards . '' 
`` How simple ! 
Well , I should never have discovered that . 
What a mind that devil of a Moliere has ! '' 
said La Fontaine . 
Then , striking his forehead , `` Oh , thou wilt never be aught but an ass , Jean La Fontaine ! '' 
he added . 
`` What are you saying there , my friend ? '' 
broke in Moliere , approaching the poet , whose aside he had heard .
