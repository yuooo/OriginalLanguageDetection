`` It was His Majesty 's beast . '' 
The hair-dresser felt , that after this observation , a short silence would be fitting , so he conformed himself to it , and then went on : -- `` The Emperor was never wounded but once , was he , sir ? '' 
The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there : -- `` In the heel . 
At Ratisbon . 
I never saw him so well dressed as on that day . 
He was as neat as a new sou . '' 
`` And you , Mr. Veteran , you must have been often wounded ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
said the soldier , `` ah ! 
not to amount to anything . 
At Marengo , I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck , a bullet in the right arm at Austerlitz , another in the left hip at Jena . 
At Friedland , a thrust from a bayonet , there , -- at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts , no matter where , at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers . 
Ah ! 
and then at Waterloo , a ball from a biscaien in the thigh , that 's all . '' 
`` How fine that is ! '' 
exclaimed the hair-dresser , in Pindaric accents , `` to die on the field of battle ! 
On my word of honor , rather than die in bed , of an illness , slowly , a bit by bit each day , with drugs , cataplasms , syringes , medicines , I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in my belly ! '' 
`` You 're not over fastidious , '' said the soldier . 
He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop . 
The show-window had suddenly been fractured . 
The wig-maker turned pale . 
`` Ah , good God ! '' 
he exclaimed , `` it 's one of them ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` A cannon-ball . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said the soldier . 
And he picked up something that was rolling about the floor . 
It was a pebble . 
The hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeing at the full speed , towards the Marche Saint-Jean . 
As he passed the hair-dresser 's shop Gavroche , who had the two brats still in his mind , had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him , and had flung a stone through his panes . 
`` You see ! '' 
shrieked the hair-dresser , who from white had turned blue , `` that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it . 
What has any one done to that gamin ? '' 
THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN In the meantime , in the Marche Saint-Jean , where the post had already been disarmed , Gavroche had just `` effected a junction '' with a band led by Enjolras , Courfeyrac , Combeferre , and Feuilly . 
They were armed after a fashion . 
Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the group . 
Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun , Combeferre the gun of a National Guard bearing the number of his legion , and in his belt , two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen , Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket , Bahorel a rifle ; Courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane . 
Feuilly , with a naked sword in his hand , marched at their head shouting : `` Long live Poland ! '' 
They reached the Quai Morland . 
Cravatless , hatless , breathless , soaked by the rain , with lightning in their eyes . 
Gavroche accosted them calmly : -- `` Where are we going ? '' 
`` Come along , '' said Courfeyrac . 
Behind Feuilly marched , or rather bounded , Bahorel , who was like a fish in water in a riot . 
He wore a scarlet waistcoat , and indulged in the sort of words which break everything . 
His waistcoat astounded a passer-by , who cried in bewilderment : -- `` Here are the reds ! '' 
`` The reds , the reds ! '' 
retorted Bahorel . 
`` A queer kind of fear , bourgeois . 
For my part I do n't tremble before a poppy , the little red hat inspires me with no alarm . 
Take my advice , bourgeois , let 's leave fear of the red to horned cattle . '' 
He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world , a permission to eat eggs , a Lenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his `` flock . '' 
Bahorel exclaimed : -- '' ` Flock ' ; a polite way of saying geese . '' 
And he tore the charge from the nail . 
This conquered Gavroche . 
From that instant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel . 
`` Bahorel , '' observed Enjolras , `` you are wrong . 
You should have let that charge alone , he is not the person with whom we have to deal , you are wasting your wrath to no purpose . 
Take care of your supply . 
One does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun . '' 
`` Each one in his own fashion , Enjolras , '' retorted Bahorel . 
`` This bishop 's prose shocks me ; I want to eat eggs without being permitted . 
Your style is the hot and cold ; I am amusing myself . 
Besides , I 'm not wasting myself , I 'm getting a start ; and if I tore down that charge , Hercle ! 
't was only to whet my appetite . '' 
This word , Hercle , struck Gavroche . 
He sought all occasions for learning , and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem . 
He inquired of him : -- `` What does Hercle mean ? '' 
Bahorel answered : -- `` It means cursed name of a dog , in Latin . '' 
Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed , probably a Friend of the A B C . 
He shouted to him : -- `` Quick , cartridges , para bellum . '' 
`` A fine man ! 
that 's true , '' said Gavroche , who now understood Latin . 
A tumultuous retinue accompanied them , -- students , artists , young men affiliated to the Cougourde of Aix , artisans , longshoremen , armed with clubs and bayonets ; some , like Combeferre , with pistols thrust into their trousers . 
An old man , who appeared to be extremely aged , was walking in the band . 
He had no arms , and he made great haste , so that he might not be left behind , although he had a thoughtful air . 
Gavroche caught sight of him : -- `` Keksekca ? '' 
said he to Courfeyrac . 
`` He 's an old duffer . '' 
It was M. Mabeuf . 
THE OLD MAN Let us recount what had taken place . 
Enjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon , near the public storehouses , at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge . 
Enjolras , Courfeyrac , and Combeferre were among those who had taken to the Rue Bassompierre , shouting : `` To the barricades ! '' 
In the Rue Lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along . 
What had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag , as though he were intoxicated . 
Moreover , he had his hat in his hand , although it had been raining all the morning , and was raining pretty briskly at the very time . 
Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf . 
He knew him through having many times accompanied Marius as far as his door . 
As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector , and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar , a couple of paces from the cavalry charges , almost in the midst of a fusillade , hatless in the rain , and strolling about among the bullets , he had accosted him , and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian : -- `` M. Mabeuf , go to your home . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` There 's going to be a row . '' 
`` That 's well . '' 
`` Thrusts with the sword and firing , M. Mabeuf . '' 
`` That is well . '' 
`` Firing from cannon . '' 
`` That is good . 
Where are the rest of you going ? '' 
`` We are going to fling the government to the earth . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
And he had set out to follow them . 
From that moment forth he had not uttered a word .
