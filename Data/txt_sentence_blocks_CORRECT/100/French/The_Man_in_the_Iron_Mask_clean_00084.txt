`` Ah ! 
in what respect ? '' 
`` You have friends in Belle-Isle , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; and it is not an easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to obtain success . '' 
D'Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought , whilst Colbert returned to the king . 
A quarter of an hour after , the captain received the written order from the king , to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle , in case of resistance , with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or refugees , and an injunction not to allow one to escape . 
`` Colbert was right , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` for me the baton of a marechal of France will cost the lives of my two friends . 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds , and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings . 
I will show them that hand so plainly , that they will have quite time enough to see it . 
Poor Porthos ! 
Poor Aramis ! 
No ; my fortune should shall not cost your wings a feather . '' 
Having thus determined , D'Artagnan assembled the royal army , embarked it at Paimboeuf , and set sail , without the loss of an unnecessary minute . 
: Belle-Ile-en-Mer . 
At the extremity of the mole , against which the furious sea beats at the evening tide , two men , holding each other by the arm , were conversing in an animated and expansive tone , without the possibility of any other human being hearing their words , borne away , as they were , one by one , by the gusts of wind , with the white foam swept from the crests of the waves . 
The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned ocean , like a gigantic crucible . 
From time to time , one of these men , turning towards the east , cast an anxious , inquiring look over the sea . 
The other , interrogating the features of his companion , seemed to seek for information in his looks . 
Then , both silent , busied with dismal thoughts , they resumed their walk . 
Every one has already perceived that these two men were our proscribed heroes , Porthos and Aramis , who had taken refuge in Belle-Isle , since the ruin of their hopes , since the discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d'Herblay . 
`` If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary , my dear Aramis , '' repeated Porthos , inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he charged his massive chest , `` It is of no use , Aramis . 
The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary circumstance . 
There has been no storm at sea ; the weather has been constantly calm , not even the lightest gale ; and even if we had had a tempest , all our boats would not have foundered . 
I repeat , it is strange . 
This complete disappearance astonishes me , I tell you . '' 
`` True , '' murmured Aramis . 
`` You are right , friend Porthos ; it is true , there is something strange in it . '' 
`` And further , '' added Porthos , whose ideas the assent of the bishop of Vannes seemed to enlarge ; `` and , further , do you not observe that if the boats have perished , not a single plank has washed ashore ? '' 
`` I have remarked it as well as yourself . '' 
`` And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in the whole island , and which I sent in search of the others - '' Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry , and by so sudden a movement , that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied . 
`` What do you say , Porthos ? 
What ! 
- You have sent the two boats - '' `` In search of the others ! 
Yes , to be sure I have , '' replied Porthos , calmly . 
`` Unhappy man ! 
What have you done ? 
Then we are indeed lost , '' cried the bishop . 
`` Lost ! 
- what did you say ? '' 
exclaimed the terrified Porthos . 
`` How lost , Aramis ? 
How are we lost ? '' 
Aramis bit his lips . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
Your pardon , I meant to say - '' `` What ? '' 
`` That if we were inclined - if we took a fancy to make an excursion by sea , we could not . '' 
`` Very good ! 
and why should that vex you ? 
A precious pleasure , ma foi ! 
For my part , I do n't regret it at all . 
What I regret is certainly not the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle : what I regret , Aramis , is Pierrefonds ; Bracieux ; le Vallon ; beautiful France ! 
Here , we are not in France , my dear friend ; we are - I know not where . 
Oh ! 
I tell you , in full sincerity of soul , and your affection will excuse my frankness , but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle . 
No ; in good truth , I am not happy ! '' 
Aramis breathed a long , but stifled sigh . 
`` Dear friend , '' replied he : `` that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago . 
If you had not sent them away , we would have departed . '' '' 
` Departed ! ' 
And the orders , Aramis ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
Why , the orders you have been constantly , in and out of season , repeating to me - that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper . 
You know very well ! '' 
`` That is true ! '' 
murmured Aramis again . 
`` You see , then , plainly , my friend , that we could not depart ; and that the sending away of the boats in search of the others can not prove prejudicial to us in the very least . '' 
Aramis was silent ; and his vague glances , luminous as that of an albatross , hovered for a long time over the sea , interrogating space , seeking to pierce the very horizon . 
`` With all that , Aramis , '' continued Porthos , who adhered to his idea , and that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it , - `` with all that , you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these unfortunate boats . 
I am assailed by cries and complaints whichever way I go . 
The children cry to see the desolation of the women , as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers . 
What do you suppose , my friend , and how ought I to answer them ? '' 
`` Think all you like , my good Porthos , and say nothing . '' 
This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all . 
He turned away grumbling something in ill-humor . 
Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer . 
`` Do you remember , '' said he , in a melancholy tone , kneading the two hands of the giant between his own with affectionate cordiality , `` do you remember , my friend , that in the glorious days of youth - do you remember , Porthos , when we were all strong and valiant - we , and the other two - if we had then had an inclination to return to France , do you think this sheet of salt water would have stopped us ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` but six leagues . '' 
`` If you had seen me get astride of a plank , would you have remained on land , Porthos ? '' 
`` No , pardieu ! 
No , Aramis . 
But , nowadays , what sort of a plank should we want , my friend ! 
I , in particular . '' 
And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh . 
`` And do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little , and that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling - of your episcopal palace , at Vannes ? 
Come , confess . '' 
`` No , '' replied Aramis , without daring to look at Porthos . 
`` Let us stay where we are , then , '' said his friend , with a sigh , which , in spite of the efforts he made to restrain it , escaped his echoing breast . 
`` Let us remain ! 
- let us remain ! 
And yet , '' added he , `` and yet , if we seriously wished , but that decidedly - if we had a fixed idea , one firmly taken , to return to France , and there were not boats - '' `` Have you remarked another thing , my friend - that is , since the disappearance of our barks , during the last two days ' absence of fishermen , not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the isle ? '' 
`` Yes , certainly ! 
you are right . 
I , too , have remarked it , and the observation was the more naturally made , for , before the last two fatal days , barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps . '' 
`` I must inquire , '' said Aramis , suddenly , and with great agitation . 
`` And then , if we had a raft constructed - '' `` But there are some canoes , my friend ; shall I board one ? '' 
`` A canoe ! 
- a canoe ! 
Can you think of such a thing , Porthos ?
