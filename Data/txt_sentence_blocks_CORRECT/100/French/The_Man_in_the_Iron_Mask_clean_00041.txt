With me , it is my sword that warns me . 
Well , it told me of nothing this morning . 
But , stay a moment - look here , it has just fallen of its own accord into the last hole of the belt . 
Do you know what that is a warning of ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well , that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very day . '' 
`` Well , '' said the surintendant , more astonished than annoyed by this frankness , `` if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your sword , I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me . '' 
`` You ! 
arrest you ! '' 
`` Of course . 
The warning - '' `` Does not concern you , since you have been arrested ever since yesterday . 
It is not you I shall have to arrest , be assured of that . 
That is the reason why I am delighted , and also the reason why I said that my day will be a happy one . '' 
And with these words , pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness of manner , the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the king . 
He was on the point of leaving the room , when Fouquet said to him , `` One last mark of kindness . '' 
`` What is it , monseigneur ? '' 
`` M. d'Herblay ; let me see Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` I am going to try and get him to come to you . '' 
D'Artagnan did not think himself so good a prophet . 
It was written that the day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been made in the morning . 
He had accordingly knocked , as we have seen , at the king 's door . 
The door opened . 
The captain thought that it was the king who had just opened it himself ; and this supposition was not altogether inadmissible , considering the state of agitation in which he had left Louis XIV . 
the previous evening ; but instead of his royal master , whom he was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect , he perceived the long , calm features of Aramis . 
So extreme was his surprise that he could hardly refrain from uttering a loud exclamation . 
`` Aramis ! '' 
he said . 
`` Good morning , dear D'Artagnan , '' replied the prelate , coldly . 
`` You here ! '' 
stammered out the musketeer . 
`` His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping , after having been greatly fatigued during the whole night . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , who could not understand how the bishop of Vannes , who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening , had become in half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune that had ever sprung up in a sovereign 's bedroom . 
In fact , to transmit the orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch 's room , to serve as an intermediary of Louis XIV . 
so as to be able to give a single order in his name at a couple paces from him , he must have become more than Richelieu had ever been to Louis XIII . 
D'Artagnan 's expressive eye , half - opened lips , his curling mustache , said as much indeed in the plainest language to the chief favorite , who remained calm and perfectly unmoved . 
`` Moreover , '' continued the bishop , `` you will be good enough , monsieur le capitaine des mousquetaires , to allow those only to pass into the king 's room this morning who have special permission . 
His majesty does not wish to be disturbed just yet . '' 
`` But , '' objected D'Artagnan , almost on the point of refusing to obey this order , and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions which the king 's silence had aroused - `` but , monsieur l'eveque , his majesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning . '' 
`` Later , later , '' said the king 's voice , from the bottom of the alcove ; a voice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer 's veins . 
He bowed , amazed , confused , and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis seemed to overwhelm him , as soon as these words had been pronounced . 
`` And then , '' continued the bishop , `` as an answer to what you were coming to ask the king , my dear D'Artagnan , here is an order of his majesty , which you will be good enough to attend to forthwith , for it concerns M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan took the order which was held out to him . 
`` To be set at liberty ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` Ah ! '' 
and he uttered a second `` ah ! '' 
still more full of intelligence than the former ; for this order explained Aramis 's presence with the king , and that Aramis , in order to have obtained Fouquet 's pardon , must have made considerable progress in the royal favor , and that this favor explained , in its tenor , the hardly conceivable assurance with which M. d'Herblay issued the order in the king 's name . 
For D'Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood something of the matter in hand to order to understand the rest . 
He bowed and withdrew a couple of paces , as though he were about to leave . 
`` I am going with you , '' said the bishop . 
`` Where to ? '' 
`` To M. Fouquet ; I wish to be a witness of his delight . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Aramis , how you puzzled me just now ! '' 
said D'Artagnan again . 
`` But you understand now , I suppose ? '' 
`` Of course I understand , '' he said aloud ; but added in a low tone to himself , almost hissing the words between his teeth , `` No , no , I do not understand yet . 
But it is all the same , for here is the order for it . '' 
And then he added , `` I will lead the way , monseigneur , '' and he conducted Aramis to Fouquet 's apartments . 
: The King 's Friend . 
Fouquet was waiting with anxiety ; he had already sent away many of his servants and friends , who , anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary receptions , had called at his door to inquire after him . 
Preserving the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair above his head , he only asked them , as he did every one , indeed , who came to the door , where Aramis was . 
When he saw D'Artagnan return , and when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him , he could hardly restrain his delight ; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness . 
The mere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest . 
The prelate was silent and grave ; D'Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of events . 
`` Well , captain , so you have brought M. d'Herblay to me . '' 
`` And something better still , monseigneur . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Liberty . '' 
`` I am free ! '' 
`` Yes ; by the king 's order . '' 
Fouquet resumed his usual serenity , that he might interrogate Aramis with a look . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , you can thank M. l'eveque de Vannes , '' pursued D'Artagnan , `` for it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the king . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Fouquet , more humiliated at the service than grateful at its success . 
`` But you , '' continued D'Artagnan , addressing Aramis - `` you , who have become M. Fouquet 's protector and patron , can you not do something for me ? '' 
`` Anything in the wide world you like , my friend , '' replied the bishop , in his calmest tones . 
`` One thing only , then , and I shall be perfectly satisfied . 
How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king , you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life ? '' 
`` From a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis , `` I can not conceal anything . '' 
`` Ah ! 
very good , tell me , then . '' 
`` Very well . 
You think that I have seen the king only twice , whilst the fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times ; only we have kept it very secret , that is all . '' 
And without trying to remove the color which at this revelation made D'Artagnan 's face flush scarlet , Aramis turned towards M. Fouquet , who was as much surprised as the musketeer . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , `` the king desires me to inform you that he is more than ever your friend , and that your beautiful fete , so generously offered by you on his behalf , has touched him to the very heart . '' 
And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner , that the latter , incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so prodigious a character , remained incapable of uttering a single syllable , and equally incapable of thought or movement . 
D'Artagnan fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to each other , and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door , when he feels his presence is an inconvenience for others ; but his eager curiosity , spurred on by so many mysteries , counseled him to remain . 
Aramis thereupon turned towards him , and said , in a quiet tone , `` You will not forget , my friend , the king 's order respecting those whom he intends to receive this morning on rising . '' 
These words were clear enough , and the musketeer understood them ; he therefore bowed to Fouquet , and then to Aramis , - to the latter with a slight admixture of ironical respect , - and disappeared . 
No sooner had he left , than Fouquet , whose impatience had hardly been able to wait for that moment , darted towards the door to close it , and then returning to the bishop , he said , `` My dear D'Herblay , I think it now high time you should explain all that has passed , for , in plain and honest truth , I do not understand anything . '' 
`` We will explain all that to you , '' said Aramis , sitting down , and making Fouquet sit down also . 
`` Where shall I begin ? '' 
`` With this first of all . 
Why does the king set me at liberty ? '' 
`` You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you arrested . '' 
`` Since my arrest , I have had time to think over it , and my idea is that it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy . 
My fete put M. Colbert out of temper , and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint against me ; Belle-Isle , for instance . ''
