`` Ah ! 
gentlemen and friends ! 
it is because by speaking I betray the watchword . 
But , hark ! 
I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it . '' 
`` Cannon ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Cannon and musketry , too ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
On hearing at a distance , among the rocks , these sinister reports of a combat which they thought had ceased : `` What can that be ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
Pardieu ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` that is just what I expected . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint ; is not that true , monsieur ? 
And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed , you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the island . '' 
`` Oh ! 
several , monsieur . '' 
`` We are lost , then , '' said the bishop of Vannes , quietly . 
`` Lost ! 
that is possible , '' replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , `` but we are not taken or hung . '' 
And so saying , he rose from the table , went to the wall , and coolly took down his sword and pistols , which he examined with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle , and who feels that life , in a great measure , depends upon the excellence and right conditions of his arms . 
At the report of the cannon , at the news of the surprise which might deliver up the island to the royal troops , the terrified crowd rushed precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their leaders . 
Aramis , pale and downcast , between two flambeaux , showed himself at the window which looked into the principal court , full of soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor . 
`` My friends , '' said D'Herblay , in a grave and sonorous voice , `` M. Fouquet , your protector , your friend , you father , has been arrested by an order of the king , and thrown into the Bastile . '' 
A sustained yell of vengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood , and enveloped him in a magnetic field . 
`` Avenge Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
cried the most excited of his hearers , `` death to the royalists ! '' 
`` No , my friends , '' replied Aramis , solemnly ; `` no , my friends ; no resistance . 
The king is master in his kingdom . 
The king is the mandatory of God . 
The king and God have struck M. Fouquet . 
Humble yourselves before the hand of God . 
Love God and the king , who have struck M. Fouquet . 
But do not avenge your seigneur , do not think of avenging him . 
You would sacrifice yourselves in vain - you , your wives and children , your property , your liberty . 
Lay down your arms , my friends - lay down your arms ! 
since the king commands you so to do - and retire peaceably to your dwellings . 
It is I who ask you to do so ; it is I who beg you to do so ; it is I who now , in the hour of need , command you to do so , in the name of M. Fouquet . '' 
The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and terror . 
`` The soldiers of Louis XIV . 
have reached the island , '' continued Aramis . 
`` From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them and you - it would be a massacre . 
Begone , then , begone , and forget ; this time I command you , in the name of the Lord of Hosts ! '' 
The mutineers retired slowly , submissive , silent . 
`` Ah ! 
what have you just been saying , my friend ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Biscarrat to the bishop , `` you may save all these inhabitants , but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend . '' 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said the bishop of Vannes , with a singular accent of nobility and courtesy , `` Monsieur de Biscarrat , be kind enough to resume your liberty . '' 
`` I am very willing to do so , monsieur ; but - '' `` That would render us a service , for when announcing to the king 's lieutenant the submission of the islanders , you will perhaps obtain some grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has been effected . '' 
`` Grace ! '' 
replied Porthos with flashing eyes , `` what is the meaning of that word ? '' 
Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly , as he had been accustomed to do in the days of their youth , when he wanted to warn Porthos that he had committed , or was about to commit , a blunder . 
Porthos understood him , and was silent immediately . 
`` I will go , messieurs , '' replied Biscarrat , a little surprised likewise at the word `` grace '' pronounced by the haughty musketeer , of and to whom , but a few minutes before , he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic exploits with which his father had delighted him . 
`` Go , then , Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said Aramis , bowing to him , `` and at parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude . '' 
`` But you , messieurs , you whom I think it an honor to call my friends , since you have been willing to accept that title , what will become of you in the meantime ? '' 
replied the officer , very much agitated at taking leave of the two ancient adversaries of his father . 
`` We will wait here . '' 
`` But , mon Dieu ! 
- the order is precise and formal . '' 
`` I am bishop of Vannes , Monsieur de Biscarrat ; and they no more shoot a bishop than they hang a gentleman . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , monsieur - yes , monseigneur , '' replied Biscarrat ; `` it is true , you are right , there is still that chance for you . 
Then , I will depart , I will repair to the commander of the expedition , the king 's lieutenant . 
Adieu ! 
then , messieurs , or rather , to meet again , I hope . '' 
The worthy officer , jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis , departed in the direction of the sound of cannon , which , by surging the crowd into the fort , had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their prisoner . 
Aramis watched the departure , and when left alone with Porthos : `` Well , do you comprehend ? '' 
said he . 
`` Ma foi ! 
no . '' 
`` Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here ? '' 
`` No ; he is a brave fellow . '' 
`` Yes ; but the grotto of Locmaria - is it necessary all the world should know it ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is true , that is true ; I comprehend . 
We are going to escape by the cavern . '' 
`` If you please , '' cried Aramis , gayly . 
`` Forward , friend Porthos ; our boat awaits us . 
King Louis has not caught us - yet . '' 
: The Grotto of Locmaria . 
The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it . 
Besides , night was advancing ; midnight had struck at the fort . 
Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms . 
They walked , then , across the heath , which stretched between the mole and the cavern , listening to every noise , in order better to avoid an ambush . 
From time to time , on the road which they had carefully left on their left , passed fugitives coming from the interior , at the news of the landing of the royal troops . 
Aramis and Porthos , concealed behind some projecting mass of rock , collected the words that escaped from the poor people , who fled , trembling , carrying with them their most valuable effects , and tried , whilst listening to their complaints , to gather something from them for their own interest . 
At length , after a rapid race , frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages , they reached the deep grottoes , in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season . 
`` My good friend , '' said Porthos , panting vigorously , `` we have arrived , it seems . 
But I thought you spoke of three men , three servants , who were to accompany us . 
I do n't see them - where are they ? '' 
`` Why should you see them , Porthos ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern , and , no doubt , are resting , having accomplished their rough and difficult task . '' 
Aramis stopped Porthos , who was preparing to enter the cavern . 
`` Will you allow me , my friend , '' said he to the giant , `` to pass in first ? 
I know the signal I have given to these men ; who , not hearing it , would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark . ''
