- urgent ! '' 
And Baisemeaux , shrugging his shoulders with an air of supreme disdain , flung the order on the table and began eating again . 
`` They are fond of these tricks ! '' 
he said , with his mouth full ; `` they seize a man , some fine day , keep him under lock and key for ten years , and write to you , ` Watch this fellow well , ' or ` Keep him very strictly . ' 
And then , as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a dangerous man , all of a sudden , without rhyme or reason they write - ` Set him at liberty , ' and actually add to their missive - ` urgent . ' 
You will own , my lord , 't is enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders ! '' 
`` What do you expect ? 
It is for them to write , '' said Aramis , `` for you to execute the order . '' 
`` Good ! 
good ! 
execute it ! 
Oh , patience ! 
You must not imagine that I am a slave . '' 
`` Gracious Heaven ! 
my very good M. Baisemeaux , who ever said so ? 
Your independence is well known . '' 
`` Thank Heaven ! '' 
`` But your goodness of heart is also known . '' 
`` Ah ! 
do n't speak of it ! '' 
`` And your obedience to your superiors . 
Once a soldier , you see , Baisemeaux , always a soldier . '' 
`` And I shall directly obey ; and to-morrow morning , at daybreak , the prisoner referred to shall be set free . '' 
`` To-morrow ? '' 
`` At dawn . '' 
`` Why not this evening , seeing that the lettre de cachet bears , both on the direction and inside , ` urgent ' ? '' 
`` Because this evening we are at supper , and our affairs are urgent , too ! '' 
`` Dear Baisemeaux , booted though I be , I feel myself a priest , and charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst . 
This unfortunate man has suffered long enough , since you have just told me that he has been your prisoner these ten years . 
Abridge his suffering . 
His good time has come ; give him the benefit quickly . 
God will repay you in Paradise with years of felicity . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` I entreat you . '' 
`` What ! 
in the very middle of our repast ? '' 
`` I implore you ; such an action is worth ten Benedicites . '' 
`` It shall be as you desire , only our supper will get cold . '' 
`` Oh ! 
never heed that . '' 
Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois , and by a very natural motion turned round towards the door . 
The order had remained on the table ; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to change the paper for another , folded in the same manner , which he drew swiftly from his pocket . 
`` Francois , '' said the governor , `` let the major come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere . '' 
Francois bowed and quitted the room , leaving the two companions alone . 
: The General of the Order . 
There was now a brief silence , during which Aramis never removed his eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment . 
The latter seemed only half decided to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper , and it was clear he was trying to invent some pretext , whether good or bad , for delay , at any rate till after dessert . 
And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at last . 
`` Eh ! 
but it is impossible ! '' 
he cried . 
`` How impossible ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Give me a glimpse of this impossibility . '' '' 
'T is impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour . 
Where can he go to , a man so unacquainted with Paris ? '' 
`` He will find a place wherever he can . '' 
`` You see , now , one might as well set a blind man free ! '' 
`` I have a carriage , and will take him wherever he wishes . '' 
`` You have an answer for everything . 
Francois , tell monsieur le major to go and open the cell of M. Seldon , No. 3 , Bertaudiere . '' 
`` Seldon ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis , very naturally . 
`` You said Seldon , I think ? '' 
`` I said Seldon , of course . 
'T is the name of the man they set free . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you mean to say Marchiali ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Marchiali ? 
oh ! 
yes , indeed . 
No , no , Seldon . '' 
`` I think you are making a mistake , Monsieur Baisemeaux . '' 
`` I have read the order . '' 
`` And I also . '' 
`` And I saw ` Seldon ' in letters as large as that , '' and Baisemeaux held up his finger . 
`` And I read ` Marchiali ' in characters as large as this , '' said Aramis , also holding up two fingers . 
`` To the proof ; let us throw a light on the matter , '' said Baisemeaux , confident he was right . 
`` There is the paper , you have only to read it . '' 
`` I read ` Marchiali , ' '' returned Aramis , spreading out the paper . 
`` Look . '' 
Baisemeaux looked , and his arms dropped suddenly . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he said , quite overwhelmed ; `` yes , Marchiali . 
'T is plainly written Marchiali ! 
Quite true ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
- '' `` How ? 
the man of whom we have talked so much ? 
The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of ? '' 
`` There is ` Marchiali , ' '' repeated the inflexible Aramis . 
`` I must own it , monseigneur . 
But I understand nothing about it . '' 
`` You believe your eyes , at any rate . '' 
`` To tell me very plainly there is ` Marchiali . ' '' 
`` And in a good handwriting , too . '' '' 
'T is a wonder ! 
I still see this order and the name of Seldon , Irishman . 
I see it . 
Ah !
