said Gavroche . 
He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution , then he crawled in after them , pulled the stones together , and closed the opening hermetically again . 
All three had stretched out on the mat . 
Gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` go to sleep ! 
I 'm going to suppress the candelabra . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche , pointing to the netting , `` what 's that for ? '' 
`` That , '' answered Gavroche gravely , `` is for the rats . 
Go to sleep ! '' 
Nevertheless , he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures , and he continued : -- `` It 's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes . 
It 's used for fierce animals . 
There 's a whole shopful of them there . 
All you 've got to do is to climb over a wall , crawl through a window , and pass through a door . 
You can get as much as you want . '' 
As he spoke , he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket , and the little one murmured : -- `` Oh ! 
how good that is ! 
It 's warm ! '' 
Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket . 
`` That 's from the Jardin des Plantes , too , '' said he . 
`` I took that from the monkeys . '' 
And , pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying , a very thick and admirably made mat , he added : -- `` That belonged to the giraffe . '' 
After a pause he went on : -- `` The beasts had all these things . 
I took them away from them . 
It did n't trouble them . 
I told them : ` It 's for the elephant . ' '' 
He paused , and then resumed : -- `` You crawl over the walls and you do n't care a straw for the government . 
So there now ! '' 
The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid and ingenious being , a vagabond like themselves , isolated like themselves , frail like themselves , who had something admirable and all-powerful about him , who seemed supernatural to them , and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank , mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles . 
`` Monsieur , '' ventured the elder timidly , `` you are not afraid of the police , then ? '' 
Gavroche contented himself with replying : -- `` Brat ! 
Nobody says ` police , ' they say ` bobbies . ' '' 
The smaller had his eyes wide open , but he said nothing . 
As he was on the edge of the mat , the elder being in the middle , Gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done , and heightened the mat under his head with old rags , in such a way as to form a pillow for the child . 
Then he turned to the elder : -- `` Hey ! 
We 're jolly comfortable here , ai n't we ? '' 
`` Ah , yes ! '' 
replied the elder , gazing at Gavroche with the expression of a saved angel . 
The two poor little children who had been soaked through , began to grow warm once more . 
`` Ah , by the way , '' continued Gavroche , `` what were you bawling about ? '' 
And pointing out the little one to his brother : -- `` A mite like that , I 've nothing to say about , but the idea of a big fellow like you crying ! 
It 's idiotic ; you looked like a calf . '' 
`` Gracious , replied the child , `` we have no lodging . '' 
`` Bother ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , `` you do n't say ` lodgings , ' you say ` crib . ' '' 
`` And then , we were afraid of being alone like that at night . '' 
`` You do n't say ` night , ' you say ` darkmans . ' '' 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the child . 
`` Listen , '' went on Gavroche , `` you must never bawl again over anything . 
I 'll take care of you . 
You shall see what fun we 'll have . 
In summer , we 'll go to the Glaciere with Navet , one of my pals , we 'll bathe in the Gare , we 'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz , -- that makes the laundresses raging . 
They scream , they get mad , and if you only knew how ridiculous they are ! 
We 'll go and see the man-skeleton . 
And then I 'll take you to the play . 
I 'll take you to see Frederick Lemaitre . 
I have tickets , I know some of the actors , I even played in a piece once . 
There were a lot of us fellers , and we ran under a cloth , and that made the sea . 
I 'll get you an engagement at my theatre . 
We 'll go to see the savages . 
They ai n't real , those savages ai n't . 
They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles , and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white . 
Then , we 'll go to the Opera . 
We 'll get in with the hired applauders . 
The Opera claque is well managed . 
I would n't associate with the claque on the boulevard . 
At the Opera , just fancy ! 
some of them pay twenty sous , but they 're ninnies . 
They 're called dishclouts . 
And then we 'll go to see the guillotine work . 
I 'll show you the executioner . 
He lives in the Rue des Marais . 
Monsieur Sanson . 
He has a letter-box at his door . 
Ah ! 
we 'll have famous fun ! '' 
At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche 's finger , and recalled him to the realities of life . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
said he , `` there 's the wick giving out . 
Attention ! 
I ca n't spend more than a sou a month on my lighting . 
When a body goes to bed , he must sleep . 
We have n't the time to read M. Paul de Kock 's romances . 
And besides , the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochere , and all the bobbies need to do is to see it . '' 
`` And then , '' remarked the elder timidly , -- he alone dared talk to Gavroche , and reply to him , `` a spark might fall in the straw , and we must look out and not burn the house down . '' 
`` People do n't say ` burn the house down , ' '' remarked Gavroche , `` they say ` blaze the crib . ' '' 
The storm increased in violence , and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder . 
`` You 're taken in , rain ! '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house . 
Winter is a stupid ; it wastes its merchandise , it loses its labor , it ca n't wet us , and that makes it kick up a row , old water-carrier that it is . '' 
This allusion to the thunder , all the consequences of which Gavroche , in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century , accepted , was followed by a broad flash of lightning , so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack . 
Almost at the same instant , the thunder rumbled with great fury . 
The two little creatures uttered a shriek , and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced , but Gavroche turned his bold face to them , and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh . 
`` Calm down , children . 
Do n't topple over the edifice . 
That 's fine , first-class thunder ; all right . 
That 's no slouch of a streak of lightning . 
Bravo for the good God ! 
Deuce take it ! 
It 's almost as good as it is at the Ambigu . ''
