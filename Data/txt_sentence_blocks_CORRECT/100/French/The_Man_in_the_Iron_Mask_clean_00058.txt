`` What is that ? '' 
`` Without doubt you risk much more than I do , because you love . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus ! 
Well , then , De Guiche , beware of Montalais . '' 
`` What ! 
of that kind friend ? '' 
`` She was the friend of - her you know of . 
She ruined her by pride . '' 
`` You are mistaken . '' 
`` And now , when she has ruined her , she would ravish from her the only thing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Her love . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of the king - a plot formed in the very house of Madame . '' 
`` Can you think so ? '' 
`` I am certain of it . '' 
`` By Montalais ? '' 
`` Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for - the other ! '' 
`` Explain yourself clearly , my friend ; and if I can understand you - '' `` In two words . 
Madame has been long jealous of the king . '' 
`` I know she has - '' `` Oh ! 
fear nothing - you are beloved - you are beloved , count ; do you feel the value of these three words ? 
They signify that you can raise your head , that you can sleep tranquilly , that you can thank God every minute of you life . 
You are beloved ; that signifies that you may hear everything , even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your happiness . 
You are beloved , De Guiche , you are beloved ! 
You do not endure those atrocious nights , those nights without end , which , with arid eye and fainting heart , others pass through who are destined to die . 
You will live long , if you act like the miser who , bit by bit , crumb by crumb , collects and heaps up diamonds and gold . 
You are beloved ! 
- allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever . '' 
De Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man , half mad with despair , till there passed through his heart something like remorse at his own happiness . 
Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement , to assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man . 
`` They will make her , whose name I should wish still to be able to pronounce - they will make her suffer . 
Swear to me that you will not second them in anything - but that you will defend her when possible , as I would have done myself . '' 
`` I swear I will , '' replied De Guiche . 
`` And , '' continued Raoul , `` some day , when you shall have rendered her a great service - some day when she shall thank you , promise me to say these words to her - ' I have done you this kindness , madame , at the warm request of M. de Bragelonne , whom you so deeply injured . ' '' 
`` I swear I will , '' murmured De Guiche . 
`` That is all . 
Adieu ! 
I set out to-morrow , or the day after , for Toulon . 
If you have a few hours to spare , give them to me . '' 
`` All ! 
all ! '' 
cried the young man . 
`` Thank you ! '' 
`` And what are you going to do now ? '' 
`` I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet 's residence , where we hope to find M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , I wish to embrace him before my departure . 
He is a brave man , who loves me dearly . 
Farewell , my friend ; you are expected , no doubt ; you will find me , when you wish , at the lodgings of the comte . 
Farewell ! '' 
The two young men embraced . 
Those who chanced to see them both thus , would not have hesitated to say , pointing to Raoul , `` That is the happy man ! '' 
: Planchet 's Inventory . 
Athos , during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul , had gone to Planchet 's residence to inquire after D'Artagnan . 
The comte , on arriving at the Rue des Lombards , found the shop of the grocer in great confusion ; but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale , or that of an arrival of goods . 
Planchet was not enthroned , as usual , on sacks and barrels . 
No . 
A young man with a pen behind his ear , and another with an account-book in his hand , were setting down a number of figures , whilst a third counted and weighed . 
An inventory was being taken . 
Athos , who had no knowledge of commercial matters , felt himself a little embarrassed by material obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus employed . 
He saw several customers sent away , and asked himself whether he , who came to buy nothing , would not be more properly deemed importunate . 
He therefore asked very politely if he could see M. Planchet . 
The reply , quite carelessly given , was that M. Planchet was packing his trunks . 
These words surprised Athos . 
`` What ! 
his trunks ? '' 
said he ; `` is M. Planchet going away ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , directly . '' 
`` Then , if you please , inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to speak to him for a moment . '' 
At the mention of the comte 's name , one of the young men , no doubt accustomed to hear it pronounced with respect , immediately went to inform Planchet . 
It was at this moment that Raoul , after his painful scene with Montalais and De Guiche , arrived at the grocer 's house . 
Planchet left his job directly he received the comte 's message . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte ! '' 
exclaimed he , `` how glad I am to see you ! 
What good star brings you here ? '' 
`` My dear Planchet , '' said Athos , pressing the hand of his son , whose sad look he silently observed , - `` we are come to learn of you - But in what confusion do I find you ! 
You are as white as a miller ; where have you been rummaging ? '' 
`` Ah , diable ! 
take care , monsieur ; do n't come near me till I have well shaken myself . '' 
`` What for ? 
Flour or dust only whiten . '' 
`` No , no ; what you see on my arms is arsenic . '' 
`` Arsenic ? '' 
`` Yes ; I am taking my precautions against rats . '' 
`` Ay , I suppose in an establishment like this , rats play a conspicuous part . '' 
`` It is not with this establishment I concern myself , monsieur le comte . 
The rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of again . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Why , you may have observed , monsieur , my inventory is being taken . '' 
`` Are you leaving trade , then ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
mon Dieu ! 
yes . 
I have disposed of my business to one of my young men . '' 
`` Bah ! 
you are rich , then , I suppose ? '' 
`` Monsieur , I have taken a dislike to the city ; I do n't know whether it is because I am growing old , and as M. d'Artagnan one day said , when we grow old we more often think of the adventures of our youth ; but for some time past I have felt myself attracted towards the country and gardening .
