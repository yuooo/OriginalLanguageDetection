He had stiffened himself in that coffin , and had become a little like a corpse . 
The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks . 
He had , in a manner , to thaw out , from the tomb . 
`` You are benumbed , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` It is a pity that I have a game leg , for otherwise we might step out briskly . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
replied Jean Valjean , `` four paces will put life into my legs once more . '' 
They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed . 
On arriving before the closed gate and the porter 's pavilion Fauchelevent , who held the grave-digger 's card in his hand , dropped it into the box , the porter pulled the rope , the gate opened , and they went out . 
`` How well everything is going ! '' 
said Fauchelevent ; `` what a capital idea that was of yours , Father Madeleine ! '' 
They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world . 
In the neighborhood of the cemetery , a shovel and pick are equal to two passports . 
The Rue Vaugirard was deserted . 
`` Father Madeleine , '' said Fauchelevent as they went along , and raising his eyes to the houses , `` Your eyes are better than mine . 
Show me No. 87 . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` There is no one in the street , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` Give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me . '' 
Fauchelevent entered No. 87 , ascended to the very top , guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret , and knocked in the dark , at the door of an attic . 
A voice replied : `` Come in . '' 
It was Gribier 's voice . 
Fauchelevent opened the door . 
The grave-digger 's dwelling was , like all such wretched habitations , an unfurnished and encumbered garret . 
A packing-case -- a coffin , perhaps -- took the place of a commode , a butter-pot served for a drinking-fountain , a straw mattress served for a bed , the floor served instead of tables and chairs . 
In a corner , on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet , a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap . 
The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned . 
One would have said that there had been an earthquake `` for one . '' 
The covers were displaced , the rags scattered about , the jug broken , the mother had been crying , the children had probably been beaten ; traces of a vigorous and ill-tempered search . 
It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card , and had made everybody in the garret , from the jug to his wife , responsible for its loss . 
He wore an air of desperation . 
But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success . 
He entered and said : -- `` I have brought you back your shovel and pick . '' 
Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction . 
`` Is it you , peasant ? '' 
`` And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery . '' 
And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
demanded Gribier . 
`` The meaning of it is , that you dropped your card out of your pocket , that I found it on the ground after you were gone , that I have buried the corpse , that I have filled the grave , that I have done your work , that the porter will return your card to you , and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs . 
There you have it , conscript . '' 
`` Thanks , villager ! '' 
exclaimed Gribier , radiant . 
`` The next time I will pay for the drinks . '' 
A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY An hour later , in the darkness of night , two men and a child presented themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus . 
The elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped . 
They were Fauchelevent , Jean Valjean , and Cosette . 
The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer 's in the Rue du Chemin-Vert , where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day . 
Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing . 
She trembled to such a degree that she wept . 
She had neither eaten nor slept . 
The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions , without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze . 
Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days . 
She divined that they were passing through a crisis . 
She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to `` be good . '' 
Who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words , pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being : Say nothing ! 
Fear is mute . 
Moreover , no one guards a secret like a child . 
But when , at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours , she beheld Jean Valjean again , she gave vent to such a cry of joy , that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry , would have guessed that it issued from an abyss . 
Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words . 
All the doors opened . 
Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in . 
The porter , who had received his instructions , opened the little servant 's door which connected the courtyard with the garden , and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago , in the wall at the bottom of the court , which faced the carriage entrance . 
The porter admitted all three of them through this door , and from that point they reached the inner , reserved parlor where Fauchelevent , on the preceding day , had received his orders from the prioress . 
The prioress , rosary in hand , was waiting for them . 
A vocal mother , with her veil lowered , stood beside her . 
A discreet candle lighted , one might almost say , made a show of lighting the parlor . 
The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review . 
There is nothing which examines like a downcast eye . 
Then she questioned him : -- `` You are the brother ? '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother , '' replied Fauchelevent . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Ultime Fauchelevent . '' 
He really had had a brother named Ultime , who was dead . 
`` Where do you come from ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` From Picquigny , near Amiens . '' 
`` What is your age ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Fifty . '' 
`` What is your profession ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Gardener . '' 
`` Are you a good Christian ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Every one is in the family . '' 
`` Is this your little girl ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` You are her father ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Her grandfather . '' 
The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice `` He answers well . '' 
Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word . 
The prioress looked attentively at Cosette , and said half aloud to the vocal mother : -- `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor , then the prioress turned round and said : -- `` Father Fauvent , you will get another knee-cap with a bell . 
Two will be required now . '' 
On the following day , therefore , two bells were audible in the garden , and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils . 
At the extreme end of the garden , under the trees , two men , Fauvent and another man , were visible as they dug side by side . 
An enormous event . 
Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other : `` He is an assistant gardener . '' 
The vocal mothers added : `` He is a brother of Father Fauvent . '' 
Jean Valjean was , in fact , regularly installed ; he had his belled knee-cap ; henceforth he was official . 
His name was Ultime Fauchelevent . 
The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress 's observation upon Cosette : `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The prioress , that pronounced prognosticator , immediately took a fancy to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil .
