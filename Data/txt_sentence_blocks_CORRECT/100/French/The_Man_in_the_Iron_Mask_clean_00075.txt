`` What sort of man is he ? '' 
`` He is a dark man , broad-shouldered , bull-necked . '' 
A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure , darkening the sun . 
Gourville , who was still looking , with one hand over his eyes , became able to see what he sought , and all at once , jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him : `` Colbert ! '' 
said he , in a voice broken by emotion . 
`` Colbert ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` Too strange ! 
but no , it is impossible ! '' 
`` I tell you I recognized him , and he , at the same time , so plainly recognized me , that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop . 
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track . '' 
`` In that case he would join us , instead of lying by . 
What is he doing there ? '' 
`` He is watching us , without a doubt . '' 
`` I do not like uncertainty , '' said Fouquet ; `` let us go straight up to him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , do not do that , the lighter is full of armed men . '' 
`` He wishes to arrest me , then , Gourville ? 
Why does he not come on ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin . '' 
`` But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor ! '' 
`` Nothing yet proves that they are watching you , monseigneur ; be patient ! '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` Do not stop ; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king 's order with zeal . 
Redouble the speed . 
He who lives will see ! '' 
`` That is better . 
Come ! '' 
cried Fouquet ; `` since they remain stock-still yonder , let us go on . '' 
The captain gave the signal , and Fouquet 's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested . 
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ? 
Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! ' 
Well ! 
M. Colbert takes care not to pass me . 
He is a prudent man is M. Colbert . '' 
He was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes , watching each other . 
When the surintendant landed , Gourville hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once , and have the relays prepared . 
But , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first , and Colbert , approaching Fouquet , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect - marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse . 
Fouquet was completely self-possessed ; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself . 
He wished to fall from such a height that his fall should crush some of his enemies . 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert . 
The surintendant , therefore , coming up to him , replied , with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him - `` What ! 
is that you , M. Colbert ? '' 
`` To offer you my respects , monseigneur , '' said the latter . 
`` Were you in that lighter ? '' 
- pointing to the one with twelve rowers . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Of twelve rowers ? '' 
said Fouquet ; `` what luxury , M. Colbert . 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
- and Colbert blushed . 
`` This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear , Monsieur l'Intendant ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` But you have , happily , arrived ! 
-- You see , however , '' added he , a moment after , `` that I , who had but eight rowers , arrived before you . '' 
And he turned his back towards him , leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first . 
At least he did not give him the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened . 
Colbert , so annoyingly attacked , did not give way . 
`` I have not been quick , monseigneur , '' he replied , `` because I followed your example whenever you stopped . '' 
`` And why did you do that , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
cried Fouquet , irritated by the base audacity ; `` as you had a superior crew to mine , why did you not either join me or pass me ? '' 
`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . '' 
`` Bon jour ! 
monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer ; `` how did you get through the journey ? '' 
`` Tolerably well , thank you . '' 
`` And the fever ? '' 
`` But poorly . 
I drink , as you perceive . 
I am scarcely arrived , and I have already levied a contribution of tisane upon Nantes . '' 
`` You should sleep first , monseigneur . '' 
`` Eh ! 
corbleu !
