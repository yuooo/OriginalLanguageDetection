`` Yes ; as you see . '' 
`` You have given a most charming fete to the king . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
beautiful ! '' 
`` Is the king pleased ? '' 
`` Enchanted . '' 
`` Did he desire you to say as much to me ? '' 
`` He would not choose so unworthy a messenger , monseigneur . '' 
`` You do not do yourself justice , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` Is that your bed , there ? '' 
`` Yes ; but why do you ask ? 
Are you not satisfied with your own ? '' 
`` My I speak frankly to you ? '' 
`` Most assuredly . '' 
`` Well , then , I am not . '' 
Fouquet started ; and then replied , `` Will you take my room , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` What ! 
deprive you of it , monseigneur ? 
never ! '' 
`` What am I to do , then ? '' 
`` Allow me to share yours with you . '' 
Fouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly . 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
he said , `` you have just left the king . '' 
`` I have , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room ? '' 
`` Monseigneur - '' `` Very well , Monsieur d'Artagnan , very well . 
You are the master here . '' 
`` I assure you , monseigneur , that I do not wish to abuse - '' Fouquet turned to his valet , and said , `` Leave us . '' 
When the man had left , he said to D'Artagnan , `` You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
`` A man of your superior intelligence can not have come to talk with a man like myself , at such an hour as the present , without grave motives . '' 
`` Do not interrogate me . '' 
`` On the contrary . 
What do you want with me ? '' 
`` Nothing more than the pleasure of your society . '' 
`` Come into the garden , then , '' said the superintendent suddenly , `` or into the park . '' 
`` No , '' replied the musketeer , hastily , `` no . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` The fresh air - '' `` Come , admit at once that you arrest me , '' said the superintendent to the captain . 
`` Never ! '' 
said the latter . 
`` You intend to look after me , then ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , I do , upon my honor . '' 
`` Upon your honor - ah ! 
that is quite another thing ! 
So I am to be arrested in my own house . '' 
`` Do not say such a thing . '' 
`` On the contrary , I will proclaim it aloud . '' 
`` If you do so , I shall be compelled to request you to be silent . '' 
`` Very good ! 
Violence towards me , and in my own house , too . '' 
`` We do not seem to understand one another at all . 
Stay a moment ; there is a chess-board there ; we will have a game , if you have no objections . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , I am in disgrace , then ? '' 
`` Not at all ; but - '' `` I am prohibited , I suppose , from withdrawing from your sight . '' 
`` I do not understand a word you are saying , monseigneur ; and if you wish me to withdraw , tell me so . '' 
`` My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , your mode of action is enough to drive me mad ; I was almost sinking for want of sleep , but you have completely awakened me . '' 
`` I shall never forgive myself , I am sure ; and if you wish to reconcile me with myself , why , go to sleep in your bed in my presence ; and I shall be delighted . '' 
`` I am under surveillance , I see . '' 
`` I will leave the room if you say any such thing . '' 
`` You are beyond my comprehension . '' 
`` Good night , monseigneur , '' said D'Artagnan , as he pretended to withdraw . 
Fouquet ran after him . 
`` I will not lie down , '' he said . 
`` Seriously , and since you refuse to treat me as a man , and since you finesse with me , I will try and set you at bay , as a hunter does a wild boar . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , pretending to smile . 
`` I shall order my horses , and set off for Paris , '' said Fouquet , sounding the captain of the musketeers . 
`` If that be the case , monseigneur , it is very difficult . '' 
`` You will arrest me , then ? '' 
`` No , but I shall go along with you . '' 
`` That is quite sufficient , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' returned Fouquet , coldly . 
`` It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man of intelligence and resource ; but with me all this is quite superfluous . 
Let us come to the point . 
Do me a service . 
Why do you arrest me ? 
What have I done ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know nothing about what you may have done ; but I do not arrest you - this evening , at least ! '' 
`` This evening ! '' 
said Fouquet , turning pale , `` but to-morrow ? '' 
`` It is not to-morrow just yet , monseigneur . 
Who can ever answer for the morrow ? '' 
`` Quick , quick , captain ! 
let me speak to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` Alas ! 
that is quite impossible , monseigneur . 
I have strict orders to see that you hold no communication with any one . '' 
`` With M. d'Herblay , captain - with your friend ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , is M. d'Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be prevented holding any communication ? '' 
Fouquet colored , and then assuming an air of resignation , he said : `` You are right , monsieur ; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have evoked . 
A fallen man can not assert his right to anything , even from those whose fortunes he may have made ; for a still stronger reason , he can not claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the happiness of doing a service . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` It is perfectly true , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; you have always acted in the most admirable manner towards me - in such a manner , indeed , as most becomes the man who is destined to arrest me . 
You , at least , have never asked me anything . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the Gascon , touched by his eloquent and noble tone of grief , `` will you - I ask it as a favor - pledge me your word as a man of honor that you will not leave this room ? '' 
`` What is the use of it , dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , since you keep watch and ward over me ?
