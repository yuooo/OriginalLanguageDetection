my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , I should be very glad to sleep . '' 
`` Who hinders you ? '' 
`` Why , you in the first place . '' 
`` I ? 
Oh , monseigneur ! '' 
`` No doubt you do . 
Is it at Nantes as at Paris ? 
Do you not come in the king 's name ? '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , monseigneur , '' replied the captain , `` leave the king alone ! 
The day on which I shall come on the part of the king , for the purpose you mean , take my word for it , I will not leave you long in doubt . 
You will see me place my hand on my sword , according to the ordonnance , and you will hear my say at once , in ceremonial voice , ` Monseigneur , in the name of the king , I arrest you ! ' '' 
`` You promise me that frankness ? '' 
said the superintendent . 
`` Upon my honor ! 
But we have not come to that , believe me . '' 
`` What makes you think that , M. d'Artagnan ? 
For my part , I think quite the contrary . '' 
`` I have heard speak of nothing of the kind , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Indeed , no . 
You are an agreeable man , in spite of your fever . 
The king should not , can not help loving you , at the bottom of his heart . '' 
Fouquet 's expression implied doubt . 
`` But M. Colbert ? '' 
said he ; `` does M. Colbert love me as much as you say ? '' 
`` I am not speaking of M. Colbert , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He is an exceptional man . 
He does not love you ; so much is very possible ; but , mordioux ! 
the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little trouble . '' 
`` Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend ? '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` and that , upon my life ! 
I have never met with a man of your intelligence , and heart ? '' 
`` You are pleased to say so , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Why did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment ? '' 
`` Blind that we are ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Your voice is getting hoarse , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` drink , monseigneur , drink ! '' 
And he offered him a cup of tisane , with the most friendly cordiality ; Fouquet took it , and thanked him by a gentle smile . 
`` Such things only happen to me , '' said the musketeer . 
`` I have passed ten years under your very beard , while you were rolling about tons of gold . 
You were clearing an annual pension of four millions ; you never observed me ; and you find out there is such a person in the world , just at the moment you - '' `` Just at the moment I am about to fall , '' interrupted Fouquet . 
`` That is true , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` But you thought so ; and that is the same thing . 
Well ! 
if I fall , take my word as truth , I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself , as I strike my brow , ` Fool ! 
fool ! 
- stupid mortal ! 
You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand , and you did not employ him , you did not enrich him ! ' '' 
`` You overwhelm me , '' said the captain . 
`` I esteem you greatly . '' 
`` There exists another man , then , who does not think as M. Colbert thinks , '' said the surintendant . 
`` How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination ! 
He is worse than fever ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have good cause , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Judge for yourself . '' 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters , and the hypocritical persecution of Colbert . 
`` Is not this a clear sign of my ruin ? '' 
D'Artagnan became very serious . 
`` That is true , '' he said . 
`` Yes ; it has an unsavory odor , as M. de Treville used to say . '' 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look . 
`` Am I not clearly designated in that , captain ? 
Is not the king bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris , where I have so many creatures , and to possess himself of Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` Where M. d'Herblay is , '' added D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet raised his head . 
`` As for me , monseigneur , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I can assure you the king has said nothing to me against you . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` The king commanded me to set out for Nantes , it is true ; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres . '' 
`` My friend . '' 
`` To M. de Gesvres , yes , monseigneur , '' continued the musketeer , whose eye s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips . 
`` The king , moreover , commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers , which is apparently superfluous , as the country is quite quiet . '' 
`` A brigade ! '' 
said Fouquet , raising himself upon his elbow . 
`` Ninety-six horsemen , yes , monseigneur . 
The same number as were employed in arresting MM . 
de Chalais , de Cinq-Mars , and Montmorency . '' 
Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? '' 
`` I ? 
- to what end ? 
Are you threatened ? 
Only there really is an order with respect to carriages and boats - '' `` An order ? '' 
`` Yes ; but it can not concern you - a simple measure of police . '' 
`` What is it , captain ? 
- what is it ? '' 
`` To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes , without a pass , signed by the king . '' 
`` Great God ! 
but - '' D'Artagnan began to laugh .
