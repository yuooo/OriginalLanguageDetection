`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured she . 
`` You ! '' 
replied the captain , in a stern voice , `` you here ! 
- oh ! 
madame , I should better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion of the Comte de la Fere . 
You would have wept less - and they too - and I ! '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said she , sobbing . 
`` For it was you , '' added this pitiless friend of the dead , - `` it was you who sped these two men to the grave . '' 
`` Oh ! 
spare me ! '' 
`` God forbid , madame , that I should offend a woman , or that I should make her weep in vain ; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not upon the grave of her victims . '' 
She wished to reply . 
`` What I now tell you , '' added he , coldly , `` I have already told the king . '' 
She clasped her hands . 
`` I know , '' said she , `` I have caused the death of the Vicomte de Bragelonne . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you know it ? '' 
`` The news arrived at court yesterday . 
I have traveled during the night forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte , whom I supposed to be still living , and to pray God , on the tomb of Raoul , that he would send me all the misfortunes I have merited , except a single one . 
Now , monsieur , I know that the death of the son has killed the father ; I have two crimes to reproach myself with ; I have two punishments to expect from Heaven . '' 
`` I will repeat to you , mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan , `` what M. de Bragelonne said of you , at Antibes , when he already meditated death : ` If pride and coquetry have misled her , I pardon her while despising her . 
If love has produced her error , I pardon her , but I swear that no one could have loved her as I have done . ' '' 
`` You know , '' interrupted Louise , `` that of my love I was about to sacrifice myself ; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost , dying , abandoned . 
Well ! 
never have I suffered so much as now ; because then I hoped , desired , - now I have no longer anything to wish for ; because this death drags all my joy into the tomb ; because I can no longer dare to love without remorse , and I feel that he whom I love - oh ! 
it is but just ! 
- will repay me with the tortures I have made others undergo . '' 
D'Artagnan made no reply ; he was too well convinced that she was not mistaken . 
`` Well , then , '' added she , `` dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , do not overwhelm me to-day , I again implore you ! 
I am like the branch torn from the trunk , I no longer hold to anything in this world - a current drags me on , I know not whither . 
I love madly , even to the point of coming to tell it , wretch that I am , over the ashes of the dead , and I do not blush for it - I have no remorse on this account . 
Such love is a religion . 
Only , as hereafter you will see me alone , forgotten , disdained ; as you will see me punished , as I am destined to be punished , spare me in my ephemeral happiness , leave it to me for a few days , for a few minutes . 
Now , even at the moment I am speaking to you , perhaps it no longer exists . 
My God ! 
this double murder is perhaps already expiated ! '' 
While she was speaking thus , the sound of voices and of horses drew the attention of the captain . 
M. de Saint-Aignan came to seek La Valliere . 
`` The king , '' he said , `` is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness . '' 
Saint - Aignan did not perceive D'Artagnan , half concealed by the trunk of a chestnut-tree which shaded the double grave . 
Louise thanked Saint - Aignan , and dismissed him with a gesture . 
He rejoined the party outside the inclosure . 
`` You see , madame , '' said the captain bitterly to the young woman , - `` you see your happiness still lasts . '' 
The young woman raised her head with a solemn air . 
`` A day will come , '' said she , `` when you will repent of having so misjudged me . 
On that day , it is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards me . 
Besides , I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first to pity my sufferings . 
Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; it costs me dear , and I have not paid all my debt . '' 
Saying these words , she again knelt down , softly and affectionately . 
`` Pardon me the last time , my affianced Raoul ! '' 
said she . 
`` I have broken our chain ; we are both destined to die of grief . 
It is thou who departest first ; fear nothing , I shall follow thee . 
See , only , that I have not been base , and that I have come to bid thee this last adieu . 
The Lord is my witness , Raoul , that if with my life I could have redeemed thine , I would have given that life without hesitation . 
I could not give my love . 
Once more , forgive me , dearest , kindest friend . '' 
She strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth ; then , wiping the tears from her eyes , the heavily stricken lady bowed to D'Artagnan , and disappeared . 
The captain watched the departure of the horses , horsemen , and carriage , then crossing his arms upon his swelling chest , `` When will it be my turn to depart ? '' 
said he , in an agitated voice . 
`` What is there left for man after youth , love , glory , friendship , strength , and wealth have disappeared ? 
That rock , under which sleeps Porthos , who possessed all I have named ; this moss , under which repose Athos and Raoul , who possessed much more ! '' 
He hesitated for a moment , with a dull eye ; then , drawing himself up , `` Forward ! 
still forward ! '' 
said he . 
`` When it is time , God will tell me , as he foretold the others . '' 
He touched the earth , moistened with the evening dew , with the ends of his fingers , signed himself as if he had been at the benitier in church , and retook alone - ever alone - the road to Paris . 
Epilogue . 
Four years after the scene we have just described , two horsemen , well mounted , traversed Blois early in the morning , for the purpose of arranging a hawking party the king had arranged to make in that uneven plain the Loire divides in two , which borders on the one side Meung , on the other Amboise . 
These were the keeper of the king 's harriers and the master of the falcons , personages greatly respected in the time of Louis XIII. , but rather neglected by his successor . 
The horsemen , having reconnoitered the ground , were returning , their observations made , when they perceived certain little groups of soldiers , here and there , whom the sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the inclosures . 
These were the king 's musketeers . 
Behind them came , upon a splendid horse , the captain , known by his richly embroidered uniform . 
His hair was gray , his beard turning so . 
He seemed a little bent , although sitting and handling his horse gracefully . 
He was looking about him watchfully . 
`` M. d'Artagnan does not get any older , '' said the keeper of the harriers to his colleague the falconer ; `` with ten years more to carry than either of us , he has the seat of a young man on horseback . '' 
`` That is true , '' replied the falconer . 
`` I do n't see any change in him for the last twenty years . '' 
But this officer was mistaken ; D'Artagnan in the last four years had lived a dozen . 
Age had printed its pitiless claws at each angle of his eyes ; his brow was bald ; his hands , formerly brown and nervous , were getting white , as if the blood had half forgotten them . 
D'Artagnan accosted the officers with the shade of affability which distinguishes superiors , and received in turn for his courtesy two most respectful bows . 
`` Ah ! 
what a lucky chance to see you here , Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the falconer . 
`` It is rather I who should say that , messieurs , '' replied the captain , `` for nowadays , the king makes more frequent use of his musketeers than of his falcons . '' 
`` Ah ! 
it is not as it was in the good old times , '' sighed the falconer . 
`` Do you remember , Monsieur d'Artagnan , when the late king flew the pie in the vineyards beyond Beaugence ? 
Ah ! 
dame ! 
you were not the captain of the musketeers at that time , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
-LRB- 7 -RRB- `` And you were nothing but under-corporal of the tiercelets , '' replied D'Artagnan , laughing . 
`` Never mind that , it was a good time , seeing that it is always a good time when we are young . 
Good day , monsieur the keeper of the harriers . '' 
`` You do me honor , monsieur le comte , '' said the latter . 
D'Artagnan made no reply . 
The title of comte had hardly struck him ; D'Artagnan had been a comte four years .
