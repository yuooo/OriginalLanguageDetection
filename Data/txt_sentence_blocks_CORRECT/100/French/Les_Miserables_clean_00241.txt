`` Why do you call me you ? 
Have I done anything to you ? '' 
`` No , '' he answered . 
Certainly , he had nothing against her . 
Far from it . 
Only , he felt that he could not do otherwise , now that he used thou to Cosette , than say you to Eponine . 
As he remained silent , she exclaimed : -- `` Say -- '' Then she paused . 
It seemed as though words failed that creature formerly so heedless and so bold . 
She tried to smile and could not . 
Then she resumed : -- `` Well ? '' 
Then she paused again , and remained with downcast eyes . 
`` Good evening , Mr. Marius , '' said she suddenly and abruptly ; and away she went . 
A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG The following day was the 3d of June , 1832 , a date which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds . 
Marius , at nightfall , was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening , with the same thoughts of delight in his heart , when he caught sight of Eponine approaching , through the trees of the boulevard . 
Two days in succession -- this was too much . 
He turned hastily aside , quitted the boulevard , changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur . 
This caused Eponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet , a thing which she had not yet done . 
Up to that time , she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him . 
It was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him . 
So Eponine followed him , without his suspecting the fact . 
She saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden . 
She approached the railing , felt of the bars one after the other , and readily recognized the one which Marius had moved . 
She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents : -- `` None of that , Lisette ! '' 
She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing , close beside the bar , as though she were guarding it . 
It was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall . 
There was a dim nook there , in which Eponine was entirely concealed . 
She remained thus for more than an hour , without stirring and without breathing , a prey to her thoughts . 
Towards ten o'clock in the evening , one of the two or three persons who passed through the Rue Plumet , an old , belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute , as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall , heard a dull and threatening voice saying : -- `` I 'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening . '' 
The passer-by cast a glance around him , saw no one , dared not peer into the black niche , and was greatly alarmed . 
He redoubled his pace . 
This passer-by had reason to make haste , for a very few instants later , six men , who were marching separately and at some distance from each other , along the wall , and who might have been taken for a gray patrol , entered the Rue Plumet . 
The first to arrive at the garden railing halted , and waited for the others ; a second later , all six were reunited . 
These men began to talk in a low voice . 
`` This is the place , '' said one of them . 
`` Is there a cab -LSB- dog -RSB- in the garden ? '' 
asked another . 
`` I do n't know . 
In any case , I have fetched a ball that we 'll make him eat . '' 
`` Have you some putty to break the pane with ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` The railing is old , '' interpolated a fifth , who had the voice of a ventriloquist . 
`` So much the better , '' said the second who had spoken . 
`` It wo n't screech under the saw , and it wo n't be hard to cut . '' 
The sixth , who had not yet opened his lips , now began to inspect the gate , as Eponine had done an hour earlier , grasping each bar in succession , and shaking them cautiously . 
Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened . 
As he was on the point of grasping this bar , a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness , fell upon his arm ; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast , and a hoarse voice said to him , but not loudly : -- `` There 's a dog . '' 
At the same moment , he perceived a pale girl standing before him . 
The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings . 
He bristled up in hideous wise ; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy ; their terrified air evokes terror . 
He recoiled and stammered : -- `` What jade is this ? '' 
`` Your daughter . '' 
It was , in fact , Eponine , who had addressed Thenardier . 
At the apparition of Eponine , the other five , that is to say , Claquesous , Guelemer , Babet , Brujon , and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near , without precipitation , without uttering a word , with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night . 
Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands . 
Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons . 
`` Ah , see here , what are you about there ? 
What do you want with us ? 
Are you crazy ? '' 
exclaimed Thenardier , as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low ; `` what have you come here to hinder our work for ? '' 
Eponine burst out laughing , and threw herself on his neck . 
`` I am here , little father , because I am here . 
Is n't a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays ? 
It 's you who ought not to be here . 
What have you come here for , since it 's a biscuit ? 
I told Magnon so . 
There 's nothing to be done here . 
But embrace me , my good little father ! 
It 's a long time since I 've seen you ! 
So you 're out ? '' 
Thenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponine 's arms , and grumbled : -- `` That 's good . 
You 've embraced me . 
Yes , I 'm out . 
I 'm not in . 
Now , get away with you . '' 
But Eponine did not release her hold , and redoubled her caresses . 
`` But how did you manage it , little pa ? 
You must have been very clever to get out of that . 
Tell me about it ! 
And my mother ? 
Where is mother ? 
Tell me about mamma . '' 
Thenardier replied : -- `` She 's well . 
I do n't know , let me alone , and be off , I tell you . 
`` I wo n't go , so there now , '' pouted Eponine like a spoiled child ; `` you send me off , and it 's four months since I saw you , and I 've hardly had time to kiss you . '' 
And she caught her father round the neck again . 
`` Come , now , this is stupid ! '' 
said Babet . 
`` Make haste ! '' 
said Guelemer , `` the cops may pass . '' 
The ventriloquist 's voice repeated his distich : -- `` Nous n ' sommes pas le jour de l'an , `` This is n't New Year 's day A becoter papa , maman . '' 
To peck at pa and ma . '' 
Eponine turned to the five ruffians . 
`` Why , it 's Monsieur Brujon . 
Good day , Monsieur Babet . 
Good day , Monsieur Claquesous . 
Do n't you know me , Monsieur Guelemer ? 
How goes it , Montparnasse ? '' 
`` Yes , they know you ! '' 
ejaculated Thenardier . 
`` But good day , good evening , sheer off !
