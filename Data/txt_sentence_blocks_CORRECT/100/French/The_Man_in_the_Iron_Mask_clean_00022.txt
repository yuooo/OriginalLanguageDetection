`` Oh , monsieur ! '' 
`` Your movement , monseigneur , arises from an excellent disposition . 
I thank you . 
Be well assured , I aspire to more than gratitude ! 
I am convinced that , when arrived at the summit , you will judge me still more worthy to be your friend ; and then , monseigneur , we two will do such great deeds , that ages hereafter shall long speak of them . '' 
`` Tell me plainly , monsieur - tell me without disguise - what I am to-day , and what you aim at my being to-morrow . '' 
`` You are the son of King Louis XIII. , brother of Louis XIV. , natural and legitimate heir to the throne of France . 
In keeping you near him , as Monsieur has been kept - Monsieur , your younger brother - the king reserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign . 
The doctors only could dispute his legitimacy . 
But the doctors always prefer the king who is to the king who is not . 
Providence has willed that you should be persecuted ; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of France . 
You had , then , a right to reign , seeing that it is disputed ; you had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed ; and you possess royal blood , since no one has dared to shed yours , as that of your servants has been shed . 
Now see , then , what this Providence , which you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you , has done for you . 
It has given you the features , figure , age , and voice of your brother ; and the very causes of your persecution are about to become those of your triumphant restoration . 
To-morrow , after to-morrow - from the very first , regal phantom , living shade of Louis XIV. , you will sit upon his throne , whence the will of Heaven , confided in execution to the arm of man , will have hurled him , without hope of return . '' 
`` I understand , '' said the prince , `` my brother 's blood will not be shed , then . '' 
`` You will be sole arbiter of his fate . '' 
`` The secret of which they made an evil use against me ? '' 
`` You will employ it against him . 
What did he do to conceal it ? 
He concealed you . 
Living image of himself , you will defeat the conspiracy of Mazarin and Anne of Austria . 
You , my prince , will have the same interest in concealing him , who will , as a prisoner , resemble you , as you will resemble him as a king . '' 
`` I fall back on what I was saying to you . 
Who will guard him ? '' 
`` Who guarded you ? '' 
`` You know this secret - you have made use of it with regard to myself . 
Who else knows it ? '' 
`` The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse . '' 
`` What will they do ? '' 
`` Nothing , if you choose . '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
`` How can they recognize you , if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you ? '' '' 
'T is true ; but there are grave difficulties . '' 
`` State them , prince . '' 
`` My brother is married ; I can not take my brother 's wife . '' 
`` I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce ; it is in the interest of your new policy ; it is human morality . 
All that is really noble and really useful in this world will find its account therein . '' 
`` The imprisoned king will speak . '' 
`` To whom do you think he will speak - to the walls ? '' 
`` You mean , by walls , the men in whom you put confidence . '' 
`` If need be , yes . 
And besides , your royal highness - '' `` Besides ? '' 
`` I was going to say , that the designs of Providence do not stop on such a fair road . 
Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results , like a geometrical calculation . 
The king , in prison , will not be for you the cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned . 
His soul is naturally proud and impatient ; it is , moreover , disarmed and enfeebled , by being accustomed to honors , and by the license of supreme power . 
The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in the geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to your royal highness should be your ascension to the throne , and the destruction of him who is hurtful to you , has also determined that the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings . 
Therefore , his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony . 
Put into prison as a private individual , left alone with your doubts , deprived of everything , you have exhibited the most sublime , enduring principle of life in withstanding all this . 
But your brother , a captive , forgotten , and in bonds , will not long endure the calamity ; and Heaven will resume his soul at the appointed time - that is to say , soon . '' 
At this point in Aramis 's gloomy analysis , a bird of night uttered from the depths of the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes every creature tremble . 
`` I will exile the deposed king , '' said Philippe , shuddering ; '' ` twill be more human . '' 
`` The king 's good pleasure will decide the point , '' said Aramis . 
`` But has the problem been well put ? 
Have I brought out of the solution according to the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , yes ; you have forgotten nothing - except , indeed , two things . '' 
`` The first ? '' 
`` Let us speak of it at once , with the same frankness we have already conversed in . 
Let us speak of the causes which may bring about the ruin of all the hopes we have conceived . 
Let us speak of the risks we are running . '' 
`` They would be immense , infinite , terrific , insurmountable , if , as I have said , all things did not concur to render them of absolutely no account . 
There is no danger either for you or for me , if the constancy and intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that perfection of resemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon you . 
I repeat it , there are no dangers , only obstacles ; a word , indeed , which I find in all languages , but have always ill-understood , and , were I king , would have obliterated as useless and absurd . '' 
`` Yes , indeed , monsieur ; there is a very serious obstacle , an insurmountable danger , which you are forgetting . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` There is conscience , which cries aloud ; remorse , that never dies . '' 
`` True , true , '' said the bishop ; `` there is a weakness of heart of which you remind me . 
You are right , too , for that , indeed , is an immense obstacle . 
The horse afraid of the ditch , leaps into the middle of it , and is killed ! 
The man who trembling crosses his sword with that of another leaves loopholes whereby his enemy has him in his power . '' 
`` Have you a brother ? '' 
said the young man to Aramis . 
`` I am alone in the world , '' said the latter , with a hard , dry voice . 
`` But , surely , there is some one in the world whom you love ? '' 
added Philippe . 
`` No one ! 
- Yes , I love you . '' 
The young man sank into so profound a silence , that the mere sound of his respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , `` I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness ; I have not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources which I have at my disposal . 
It is useless to flash bright visions before the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness : useless , too , is it to let the magnificence of the cannon 's roar make itself heard in the ears of one who loves repose and the quiet of the country . 
Monseigneur , I have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts ; listen to my words ; precious they indeed are , in their import and their sense , for you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens , the verdant meadows , the pure air . 
I know a country instinct with delights of every kind , an unknown paradise , a secluded corner of the world - where alone , unfettered and unknown , in the thick covert of the woods , amidst flowers , and streams of rippling water , you will forget all the misery that human folly has so recently allotted you . 
Oh ! 
listen to me , my prince . 
I do not jest . 
I have a heart , and mind , and soul , and can read your own , - aye , even to its depths . 
I will not take you unready for your task , in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires , of my caprice , or my ambition . 
Let it be all or nothing . 
You are chilled and galled , sick at heart , overcome by excess of the emotions which but one hour 's liberty has produced in you . 
For me , that is a certain and unmistakable sign that you do not wish to continue at liberty . 
Would you prefer a more humble life , a life more suited to your strength ? 
Heaven is my witness , that I wish your happiness to be the result of the trial to which I have exposed you . '' 
`` Speak , speak , '' said the prince , with a vivacity which did not escape Aramis . 
`` I know , '' resumed the prelate , `` in the Bas-Poitou , a canton , of which no one in France suspects the existence . 
Twenty leagues of country is immense , is it not ? 
Twenty leagues , monseigneur , all covered with water and herbage , and reeds of the most luxuriant nature ; the whole studded with islands covered with woods of the densest foliage . 
These large marshes , covered with reeds as with a thick mantle , sleep silently and calmly beneath the sun 's soft and genial rays . 
A few fishermen with their families indolently pass their lives away there , with their great living-rafts of poplar and alder , the flooring formed of reeds , and the roof woven out of thick rushes .
