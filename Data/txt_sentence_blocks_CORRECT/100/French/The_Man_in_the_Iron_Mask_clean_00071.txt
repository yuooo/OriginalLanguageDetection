`` Since you explain yourself with such frankness , it is our duty to be frank , likewise . 
Yes , you are ruined -- yes , you are hastening to your ruin - stop . 
And , in the first place , what money have we left ? '' 
`` Seven hundred thousand livres , '' said the intendant . 
`` Bread , '' murmured Madame Fouquet . 
`` Relays , '' said Pelisson , `` relays , and fly ! '' 
`` Whither ? '' 
`` To Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly ! '' 
`` If monseigneur flies , '' said Madame Belliere , `` it will be said that he was guilty - was afraid . '' 
`` More than that , it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with me . '' 
`` We will draw up memoirs to justify you , '' said La Fontaine . 
`` Fly ! '' 
`` I will remain , '' said Fouquet . 
`` And , besides , does not everything serve me ? '' 
`` You have Belle-Isle , '' cried the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` And I am naturally going there , when going to Nantes , '' replied the superintendent . 
`` Patience , then , patience ! '' 
`` Before arriving at Nantes , what a distance ! '' 
said Madame Fouquet . 
`` Yes , I know that well , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` But what is to be done there ? 
The king summons me to the States . 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me ; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness . '' 
`` Well , I have discovered the means of reconciling everything , '' cried Pelisson . 
`` You are going to set out for Nantes . '' 
Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise . 
`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened . 
In fact , you will carry your money against all chances ; and , whilst flying , you will only have obeyed the king ; then , reaching the sea , when you like , you will embark for Belle-Isle , and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please you , like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its eyrie . '' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband . 
`` Do so , '' said Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do it ! 
do it ! '' 
cried all his friends . 
`` I will do so , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` This very evening ? '' 
`` In an hour ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune , '' said the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` And , if necessary , we will go and discover a new world , '' added La Fontaine , intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm . 
A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope . 
`` A courier from the king , '' said the master of the ceremonies . 
A profound silence immediately ensued , as if the message brought by this courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment before . 
Every one waited to see what the master would do . 
His brow was streaming with perspiration , and he was really suffering from his fever at that instant . 
He passed into his cabinet , to receive the king 's message . 
There prevailed , as we have said , such a silence in the chambers , and throughout the attendance , that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet , saying , `` That is well , monsieur . '' 
This voice was , however , broken by fatigue , and trembled with emotion . 
An instant after , Fouquet called Gourville , who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation . 
At length , he himself re-appeared among his guests ; but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them ; from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . 
A breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out , his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . 
On seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards Fouquet . 
The latter , looking at Pelisson , leaned upon his wife , and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere . 
`` Well , '' said he , in a voice which had nothing human in it . 
`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . '' 
` LOUIS . '' 
` The present letter is to serve as a receipt . ' '' 
A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment . 
`` Well , '' cried Pelisson , in his turn , `` you have received that letter ? '' 
`` Received it , yes ! '' 
`` What will you do , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , since I have received it . '' 
`` But - '' `` If I have received it , Pelisson , I have paid it , '' said the surintendant , with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present . 
`` You have paid it ! '' 
cried Madame Fouquet . 
`` Then we are ruined ! '' 
`` Come , no useless words , '' interrupted Pelisson . 
`` Next to money , life . 
Monseigneur , to horse ! 
to horse ! '' 
`` What , leave us ! '' 
at once cried both the women , wild with grief . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , in saving yourself , you save us all . 
To horse ! '' 
`` But he can not hold himself on . 
Look at him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
if he takes time to reflect - '' said the intrepid Pelisson . 
`` He is right , '' murmured Fouquet . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Gourville , rushing up the stairs , four steps at once . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
`` I escorted , as you desired , the king 's courier with the money . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
when I arrived at the Palais Royal , I saw - '' `` Take breath , my poor friend , take breath ; you are suffocating . '' 
`` What did you see ? '' 
cried the impatient friends . 
`` I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback , '' said Gourville . 
`` There , then ! '' 
cried every voice at once ; `` there , then !
