The whole family was in the garret . 
Only , it had been silent in the master 's absence , like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf . 
`` It 's I , '' said he . 
`` Good evening , daddy , '' yelped the girls . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the mother . 
`` All 's going first-rate , '' responded Jondrette , `` but my feet are beastly cold . 
Good ! 
You have dressed up . 
You have done well ! 
You must inspire confidence . '' 
`` All ready to go out . '' 
`` Do n't forget what I told you . 
You will do everything sure ? '' 
`` Rest easy . '' 
`` Because -- '' said Jondrette . 
And he left the phrase unfinished . 
Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table , probably the chisel which he had purchased . 
`` By the way , '' said Jondrette , `` have you been eating here ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the mother . 
`` I got three large potatoes and some salt . 
I took advantage of the fire to cook them . '' 
`` Good , '' returned Jondrette . 
`` To-morrow I will take you out to dine with me . 
We will have a duck and fixings . 
You shall dine like Charles the Tenth ; all is going well ! '' 
Then he added : -- `` The mouse-trap is open . 
The cats are there . '' 
He lowered his voice still further , and said : -- `` Put this in the fire . '' 
Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil , and Jondrette continued : -- `` Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the mother . 
`` What time is it ? '' 
`` Nearly six . 
The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
ejaculated Jondrette ; `` the children must go and watch . 
Come you , do you listen here . '' 
A whispering ensued . 
Jondrette 's voice became audible again : -- `` Has old Bougon left ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the mother . 
`` Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor 's room ? '' 
`` He has not been in all day , and you know very well that this is his dinner hour . '' 
`` You are sure ? '' 
`` Sure . '' 
`` All the same , '' said Jondrette , `` there 's no harm in going to see whether he is there . 
Here , my girl , take the candle and go there . '' 
Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed . 
Hardly had he concealed himself , when he perceived a light through the crack of his door . 
`` P'pa , '' cried a voice , `` he is not in here . '' 
He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter . 
`` Did you go in ? '' 
demanded her father . 
`` No , '' replied the girl , `` but as his key is in the door , he must be out . '' 
The father exclaimed : -- `` Go in , nevertheless . '' 
The door opened , and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand . 
She was as she had been in the morning , only still more repulsive in this light . 
She walked straight up to the bed . 
Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety ; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall , and it was thither that she was directing her steps . 
She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it . 
In the neighboring room , the sound of iron articles being moved was audible . 
She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand , and smiled into the mirror , humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice : -- Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine , -LSB- 28 -RSB- Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts ! 
S'adorer huit jours , c ' etait bien la peine ! 
Le temps des amours devait durer toujours ! 
Devrait durer toujours ! 
devrait durer toujours ! 
-LSB- 28 -RSB- Our love has lasted a whole week , but how short are the instants of happiness ! 
To adore each other for eight days was hardly worth the while ! 
The time of love should last forever . 
In the meantime , Marius trembled . 
It seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing . 
She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she had . 
`` How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise ! '' 
said she . 
She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it , scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn . 
`` Well ! '' 
cried her father , `` what are you about there ? '' 
`` I am looking under the bed and the furniture , '' she replied , continuing to arrange her hair ; `` there 's no one here . '' 
`` Booby ! '' 
yelled her father . 
`` Come here this minute ! 
And do n't waste any time about it ! '' 
`` Coming ! 
Coming ! '' 
said she . 
`` One has no time for anything in this hovel ! '' 
She hummed : -- Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire ; -LSB- 29 -RSB- Mon triste coeur suivra partout . 
-LSB- 29 -RSB- You leave me to go to glory ; my sad heart will follow you everywhere . 
She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out , shutting the door behind her . 
A moment more , and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls ' bare feet in the corridor , and Jondrette 's voice shouting to them : -- `` Pay strict heed ! 
One on the side of the barrier , the other at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
Do n't lose sight for a moment of the door of this house , and the moment you see anything , rush here on the instant ! 
as hard as you can go ! 
You have a key to get in . '' 
The eldest girl grumbled : -- `` The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot ! '' 
`` To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots ! '' 
said the father . 
They ran down stairs , and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside . 
There now remained in the house only Marius , the Jondrettes and probably , also , the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight , behind the door of the unused attic . 
THE USE MADE OF MARIUS ' FIVE-FRANC PIECE Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory . 
In a twinkling , and with the agility of his age , he had reached the hole in the partition .
