said the governor , sharply . 
`` And yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan took it out of his hands , effacing the characters with the point of his sword . 
`` How ! '' 
cried the governor , `` what are you doing ? 
I can not read them now ! '' 
`` It is a state secret , '' replied D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and as you know that , according to the king 's orders , it is under the penalty of death any one should penetrate it , I will , if you like , allow you to read it , and have you shot immediately afterwards . '' 
During this apostrophe - half serious , half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the coolest , most unconcerned silence . 
`` But , is it possible , '' said the governor , `` that these gentlemen do not comprehend at least some words ? '' 
`` Suppose they do ! 
If they do understand a few spoken words , it does not follow that they should understand what is written . 
They can not even read Spanish . 
A noble Spaniard , remember , ought never to know how to read . '' 
The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations , but he was still tenacious . 
`` Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress , '' said he . 
`` That I will willingly do . 
I was about to propose it to you . '' 
The fact is , the captain had quite another idea , and would have wished his friends a hundred leagues off . 
But he was obliged to make the best of it . 
He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish , giving them a polite invitation , which they accepted . 
They all turned towards the entrance of the fort , and , the incident being at an end , the eight soldiers returned to their delightful leisure , for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure . 
: Captive and Jailers . 
When they had entered the fort , and whilst the governor was making some preparations for the reception of his guests , `` Come , '' said Athos , `` let us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone . '' 
`` It is simply this , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` I have conducted hither a prisoner , who the king commands shall not be seen . 
You came here , he has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window ; I was at dinner with the governor , I saw the object thrown , and I saw Raoul pick it up . 
It does not take long to understand this . 
I understood it , and I thought you in intelligence with my prisoner . 
And then - '' `` And then - you commanded us to be shot . '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I admit it ; but , if I was the first to seize a musket , fortunately , I was the last to take aim at you . '' 
`` If you had killed me , D'Artagnan , I should have had the good fortune to die for the royal house of France , and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you , its noblest and most loyal defender . '' 
`` What the devil , Athos , do you mean by the royal house ? '' 
stammered D'Artagnan . 
`` You do n't mean that you , a well-informed and sensible man , can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot ? '' 
`` I do believe in it . '' 
`` With so much the more reason , my dear chevalier , from your having orders to kill all those who do believe in it , '' said Raoul . 
`` That is because , '' replied the captain of the musketeers - `` because every calumny , however absurd it may be , has the almost certain chance of becoming popular . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , '' replied Athos , promptly ; `` but because the king is not willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people , and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` Do not talk in such a childish manner , Athos , or I shall begin to think you have lost your senses . 
Besides , explain to me how it is possible Louis XIII . 
should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite . '' 
`` A son whom you have brought hither masked , in a fishing-boat , '' said Athos . 
`` Why not ? '' 
D'Artagnan was brought to a pause . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he ; `` whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ? '' 
`` Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite 's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur . 
Oh ! 
I am acquainted with all that , '' resumed the comte . 
D'Artagnan bit his mustache . 
`` If it were true , '' said he , `` that I had brought hither in a boat and with a carriage a masked prisoner , nothing proves that this prisoner must be a prince - a prince of the house of France . '' 
`` Ask Aramis such riddles , '' replied Athos , coolly . 
`` Aramis , '' cried the musketeer , quite at a stand . 
`` Have you seen Aramis ? '' 
`` After his discomfiture at Vaux , yes ; I have seen Aramis , a fugitive , pursued , bewildered , ruined ; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan 's head sunk on his breast in some confusion . 
`` This is the way , '' said he , `` in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom ! 
A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered fragments ! 
Athos , cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face with me in this affair ! 
for now - '' `` Well , '' said Athos , with his customary mild severity , `` is your secret lost because I know it ? 
Consult your memory , my friend . 
Have I not borne secrets heavier than this ? '' 
`` You have never borne one so dangerous , '' replied D'Artagnan , in a tone of sadness . 
`` I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die , and die unhappily . '' 
`` The will of God be done ! '' 
said Athos , `` but here is your governor . '' 
D'Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . 
The governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards D'Artagnan with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . 
With respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer , and never taking his eye from them . 
Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks , or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage . 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable , if the governor did not believe it to be quite true . 
They rose from the table to repose awhile . 
`` What is this man 's name ? 
I do n't like the looks of him , '' said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish . 
`` De Saint-Mars , '' replied the captain . 
`` He is , then , I suppose , the prince 's jailer ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
how can I tell ? 
I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , not you ! '' 
`` My friend , I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a desert . 
He would like to carry it away , but he can not ; he would like to leave it , but he dares not . 
The king will not dare to recall me , for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do ; he regrets not having me near him , from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person as myself . 
But it will happen as it may please God . '' 
`` But , '' observed Raoul , `` your not being certain proves that your situation here is provisional , and you will return to Paris ? '' 
`` Ask these gentlemen , '' interrupted the governor , `` what was their purpose in coming to Saint-Marguerite ? '' 
`` They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte - Honnorat which is considered curious ; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the island . '' 
`` That is quite at their service , as well as yours , '' replied Saint-Mars . 
D'Artagnan politely thanked him . 
`` When will they depart ? '' 
added the governor . 
`` To-morrow , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds , and left D'Artagnan alone with the pretended Spaniards . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed the musketeer , `` here is a life and a society that suits me very little . 
I command this man , and he bores me , mordioux ! 
Come , let us have a shot or two at the rabbits ; the walk will be beautiful , and not fatiguing . 
The whole island is but a league and a half in length , with the breadth of a league ; a real park .
