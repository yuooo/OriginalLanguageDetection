It humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy . 
However , I criticise , but I do not insult . 
The universe is what it is . 
I speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience . 
Receive , Eternal Father , the assurance of my distinguished consideration . 
Ah ! 
by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of paradise , I was not intended to be a Parisian , that is to say , to rebound forever , like a shuttlecock between two battledores , from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers . 
I was made to be a Turk , watching oriental houris all day long , executing those exquisite Egyptian dances , as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man , or a Beauceron peasant , or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman , or a petty German prince , furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation , and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge , that is to say , his frontier . 
Those are the positions for which I was born ! 
Yes , I have said a Turk , and I will not retract . 
I do not understand how people can habitually take Turks in bad part ; Mohammed had his good points ; respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques ! 
Let us not insult Mohammedanism , the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost ! 
Now , I insist on a drink . 
The earth is a great piece of stupidity . 
And it appears that they are going to fight , all those imbeciles , and to break each other 's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer , in the month of June , when they might go off with a creature on their arm , to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows ! 
Really , people do commit altogether too many follies . 
An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a bric-a-brac merchant 's suggests a reflection to my mind ; it is time to enlighten the human race . 
Yes , behold me sad again . 
That 's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way ! 
I am growing melancholy once more . 
Oh ! 
frightful old world . 
People strive , turn each other out , prostitute themselves , kill each other , and get used to it ! '' 
And Grantaire , after this fit of eloquence , had a fit of coughing , which was well earned . 
`` A propos of revolution , '' said Joly , `` it is decidedly abberent that Barius is in lub . '' 
`` Does any one know with whom ? '' 
demanded Laigle . 
`` Do . '' 
`` No ? '' 
`` Do ! 
I tell you . '' 
`` Marius ' love affairs ! '' 
exclaimed Grantaire . 
`` I can imagine it . 
Marius is a fog , and he must have found a vapor . 
Marius is of the race of poets . 
He who says poet , says fool , madman , Tymbraeus Apollo . 
Marius and his Marie , or his Marion , or his Maria , or his Mariette . 
They must make a queer pair of lovers . 
I know just what it is like . 
Ecstasies in which they forget to kiss . 
Pure on earth , but joined in heaven . 
They are souls possessed of senses . 
They lie among the stars . '' 
Grantaire was attacking his second bottle and , possibly , his second harangue , when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs . 
It was a boy less than ten years of age , ragged , very small , yellow , with an odd phiz , a vivacious eye , an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain , and wearing a contented air . 
The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three , addressed himself to Laigle de Meaux . 
`` Are you Monsieur Bossuet ? '' 
`` That is my nickname , '' replied Laigle . 
`` What do you want with me ? '' 
`` This . 
A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me : ` Do you know Mother Hucheloup ? ' 
I said : ` Yes , Rue Chanvrerie , the old man 's widow ; ' he said to me : ` Go there . 
There you will find M. Bossuet . 
Tell him from me : `` A B C '' . ' 
It 's a joke that they 're playing on you , is n't it . 
He gave me ten sous . '' 
`` Joly , lend me ten sous , '' said Laigle ; and , turning to Grantaire : `` Grantaire , lend me ten sous . '' 
This made twenty sous , which Laigle handed to the lad . 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the urchin . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
inquired Laigle . 
`` Navet , Gavroche 's friend . '' 
`` Stay with us , '' said Laigle . 
`` Breakfast with us , '' said Grantaire , The child replied : -- `` I ca n't , I belong in the procession , I 'm the one to shout ` Down with Polignac ! ' '' 
And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him , which is the most respectful of all possible salutes , he took his departure . 
The child gone , Grantaire took the word : -- `` That is the pure-bred gamin . 
There are a great many varieties of the gamin species . 
The notary 's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter , the cook 's gamin is called a scullion , the baker 's gamin is called a mitron , the lackey 's gamin is called a groom , the marine gamin is called the cabin-boy , the soldier 's gamin is called the drummer-boy , the painter 's gamin is called paint-grinder , the tradesman 's gamin is called an errand-boy , the courtesan gamin is called the minion , the kingly gamin is called the dauphin , the god gamin is called the bambino . '' 
In the meantime , Laigle was engaged in reflection ; he said half aloud : -- `` A B C , that is to say : the burial of Lamarque . '' 
`` The tall blonde , '' remarked Grantaire , `` is Enjolras , who is sending you a warning . '' 
`` Shall we go ? '' 
ejaculated Bossuet . 
`` It 's raiding , '' said Joly . 
`` I have sworn to go through fire , but not through water . 
I do n't wand to ged a gold . '' 
`` I shall stay here , '' said Grantaire . 
`` I prefer a breakfast to a hearse . '' 
`` Conclusion : we remain , '' said Laigle . 
`` Well , then , let us drink . 
Besides , we might miss the funeral without missing the riot . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the riot , I am with you ! '' 
cried Joly . 
Laigle rubbed his hands . 
`` Now we 're going to touch up the revolution of 1830 . 
As a matter of fact , it does hurt the people along the seams . '' 
`` I do n't think much of your revolution , '' said Grantaire . 
`` I do n't execrate this Government . 
It is the crown tempered by the cotton night-cap . 
It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella . 
In fact , I think that to-day , with the present weather , Louis Philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions , he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people , and open the umbrella end against heaven . '' 
The room was dark , large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight . 
There was no one in the wine-shop , or in the street , every one having gone off `` to watch events . '' 
`` Is it mid-day or midnight ? '' 
cried Bossuet . 
`` You ca n't see your hand before your face . 
Gibelotte , fetch a light . '' 
Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way . 
`` Enjolras disdains me , '' he muttered .
