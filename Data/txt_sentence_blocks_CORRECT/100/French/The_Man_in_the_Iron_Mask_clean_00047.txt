`` You , monseigneur , who govern this kingdom , know very well that no one can see any of the prisoners without an express order from the king . '' 
`` M. d'Herblay has entered , however . '' 
`` That remains to be proved , monseigneur . '' 
`` M. de Baisemeaux , once more I warn you to pay particular attention to what you are saying . '' 
`` All the documents are there , monseigneur . '' 
`` M. d'Herblay is overthrown . '' 
`` Overthrown ? 
- M. d'Herblay ! 
Impossible ! '' 
`` You see that he has undoubtedly influenced you . '' 
`` No , monseigneur ; what does , in fact , influence me , is the king 's service . 
I am doing my duty . 
Give me an order from him , and you shall enter . '' 
`` Stay , M. le gouverneur , I give you my word that if you allow me to see the prisoner , I will give you an order from the king at once . '' 
`` Give it to me now , monseigneur . '' 
`` And that , if you refuse me , I will have you and all your officers arrested on the spot . '' 
`` Before you commit such an act of violence , monseigneur , you will reflect , '' said Baisemeaux , who had turned very pale , `` that we will only obey an order signed by the king ; and that it will be just as easy for you to obtain one to see Marchiali as to obtain one to do me so much injury ; me , too , who am perfectly innocent . '' 
`` True . 
True ! '' 
cried Fouquet , furiously ; `` perfectly true . 
M. de Baisemeaux , '' he added , in a sonorous voice , drawing the unhappy governor towards him , `` do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur ; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out of my senses ; I am trembling all over - in fact , I feel as though I were about to faint . '' 
`` You will stand a better chance of fainting outright , Monsieur Baisemeaux , when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and thirty pieces of cannon . '' 
`` Good heavens , monseigneur , you are losing your senses . '' 
`` When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your accursed towers , and have battered open the gates of this place , and hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle ! '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! 
for pity 's sake ! '' 
`` I give you ten minutes to make up your mind , '' added Fouquet , in a calm voice . 
`` I will sit down here , in this armchair , and wait for you ; if , in ten minutes ' time , you still persist , I leave this place , and you may think me as mad as you like . 
Then - you shall see ! '' 
Baisemeaux stamped his foot on the ground like a man in a state of despair , but he did not reply a single syllable ; whereupon Fouquet seized a pen and ink , and wrote : `` Order for M. le Prevot des Marchands to assemble the municipal guard and to march upon the Bastile on the king 's immediate service . '' 
Baisemeaux shrugged his shoulders . 
Fouquet wrote : `` Order for the Duc de Bouillon and M. le Prince de Conde to assume the command of the Swiss guards , of the king 's guards , and to march upon the Bastile on the king 's immediate service . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected . 
Fouquet still wrote : `` Order for every soldier , citizen , or gentleman to seize and apprehend , wherever he may be found , le Chevalier d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes , and his accomplices , who are : first , M. de Baisemeaux , governor of the Bastile , suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion - '' `` Stop , monseigneur ! '' 
cried Baisemeaux ; `` I do not understand a single jot of the whole matter ; but so many misfortunes , even were it madness itself that had set them at their awful work , might happen here in a couple of hours , that the king , by whom I must be judged , will see whether I have been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this flood of imminent catastrophes . 
Come with me to the keep , monseigneur , you shall see Marchiali . '' 
Fouquet darted out of the room , followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the perspiration from his face . 
`` What a terrible morning ! '' 
he said ; `` what a disgrace for me ! '' 
`` Walk faster , '' replied Fouquet . 
Baisemeaux made a sign to the jailer to precede them . 
He was afraid of his companion , which the latter could not fail to perceive . 
`` A truce to this child 's play , '' he said , roughly . 
`` Let the man remain here ; take the keys yourself , and show me the way . 
Not a single person , do you understand , must hear what is going to take place here . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , undecided . 
`` Again ! '' 
cried M. Fouquet . 
`` Ah ! 
say ` no ' at once , and I will leave the Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed his head , took the keys , and unaccompanied , except by the minister , ascended the staircase . 
The higher they advanced up the spiral staircase , the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become distinct appeals and fearful imprecations . 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` That is your Marchiali , '' said the governor ; `` this is the way these madmen scream . '' 
And he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious allusion , as far as Fouquet was concerned , than politeness . 
The latter trembled ; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that had preceded it , the king 's voice . 
He paused on the staircase , snatching the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux , who thought this new madman was going to dash out his brains with one of them . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he cried , `` M. d'Herblay did not say a word about that . '' 
`` Give me the keys at once ! '' 
cried Fouquet , tearing them from his hand . 
`` Which is the key of the door I am to open ? '' 
`` That one . '' 
A fearful cry , followed by a violent blow against the door , made the whole staircase resound with the echo . 
`` Leave this place , '' said Fouquet to Baisemeaux , in a threatening tone . 
`` I ask nothing better , '' murmured the latter , to himself . 
`` There will be a couple of madmen face to face , and the one will kill the other , I am sure . '' 
`` Go ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` If you place your foot on this staircase before I call you , remember that you shall take the place of the meanest prisoner in the Bastile . '' 
`` This job will kill me , I am sure it will , '' muttered Baisemeaux , as he withdrew with tottering steps . 
The prisoner 's cries became more and more terrible . 
When Fouquet had satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase , he inserted the key in the first lock . 
It was then that he heard the hoarse , choking voice of the king , crying out , in a frenzy of rage , `` Help , help ! 
I am the king . '' 
The key of the second door was not the same as the first , and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the bunch . 
The king , however , furious and almost mad with rage and passion , shouted at the top of his voice , `` It was M. Fouquet who brought me here . 
Help me against M. Fouquet ! 
I am the king ! 
Help the king against M. Fouquet ! '' 
These cries filled the minister 's heart with terrible emotions . 
They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the door with a part of the broken chair with which the king had armed himself . 
Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the key . 
The king was almost exhausted ; he could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted , `` Death to Fouquet ! 
death to the traitor Fouquet ! '' 
The door flew open . 
: The King 's Gratitude . 
The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they suddenly and abruptly stopped , as a mutual recognition took place , and each uttered a cry of horror . 
`` Have you come to assassinate me , monsieur ? '' 
said the king , when he recognized Fouquet . 
`` The king in this state ! '' 
murmured the minister . 
Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him ; his clothes were in tatters ; his shirt , open and torn to rags , was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms . 
Haggard , ghastly pale , his hair in disheveled masses , Louis XIV . 
presented the most perfect picture of despair , distress , anger and fear combined that could possibly be united in one figure . 
Fouquet was so touched , so affected and disturbed by it , that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears .
