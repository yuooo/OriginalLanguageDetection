The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . 
Sometinies the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead . 
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour . 
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless . 
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg 's departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed . 
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed . 
In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain . 
In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season . 
Passepartout said nothing ; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam . 
On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to Mr. Fogg , and began to speak earnestly with him . 
Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy . 
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying . 
He finally managed to catch a few words , and was sure he heard his master say , `` You are certain of what you tell me ? '' 
`` Certain , sir , '' replied the engineer . 
`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux , we have n't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool . '' 
`` I will consider , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
Passepartout understood it all ; he was seized with mortal anxiety . 
The coal was giving out ! 
`` Ah , if my master can get over that , '' muttered he , `` he 'll be a famous man ! '' 
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard . 
`` Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` Ass ! '' 
replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel . 
Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend ; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained . 
And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt ? 
It was difficult to imagine . 
Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . '' 
A few moments after , the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke . 
The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on ; but on the 18th , the engineer , as he had predicted , announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day . 
`` Do not let the fires go down , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` Keep them up to the last . 
Let the valves be filled . '' 
Towards noon Phileas Fogg , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy . 
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger . 
He went to the poop , saying to himself , `` He will be like a madman ! '' 
In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck . 
The bomb was Captain Speedy . 
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
were the first words his anger permitted him to utter . 
Had the poor man be an apoplectic , he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
he repeated , with purple face . 
`` Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool , '' replied Mr. Fogg , with imperturbable calmness . 
`` Pirate ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy . 
`` I have sent for you , sir -- '' `` Pickaroon ! '' '' 
-- sir , '' continued Mr. Fogg , `` to ask you to sell me your vessel . '' 
`` No ! 
By all the devils , no ! '' 
`` But I shall be obliged to burn her . '' 
`` Burn the Henrietta ! '' 
`` Yes ; at least the upper part of her . 
The coal has given out . '' 
`` Burn my vessel ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy , who could scarcely pronounce the words . 
`` A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars ! '' 
`` Here are sixty thousand , '' replied Phileas Fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills . 
This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy . 
An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars . 
The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger . 
The Henrietta was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain . 
The bomb would not go off after all . 
Mr. Fogg had taken away the match . 
`` And I shall still have the iron hull , '' said the captain in a softer tone . 
`` The iron hull and the engine . 
Is it agreed ? '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
And Andrew Speedy , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket . 
During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit . 
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft ! 
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank . 
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr. Fogg said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir . 
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December . 
I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool -- '' `` And I did well ! '' 
cried Andrew Speedy ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! '' 
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , Captain -- '' `` Fogg . '' 
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the Yankee about you . '' 
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr. Fogg said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? '' 
`` Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts -- all the wood , that is . '' 
`` Very well . 
Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . '' 
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed . 
On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires . 
Passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . 
There was a perfect rage for demolition . 
The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk . 
But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light . 
By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown . 
Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London ; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool , with all steam on . 
And the steam was about to give out altogether ! 
`` Sir , '' said Captain Speedy , who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg 's project , `` I really commiserate you . 
Everything is against you . 
We are only opposite Queenstown . '' 
`` Ah , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` is that place where we see the lights Queenstown ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Can we enter the harbour ? '' 
`` Not under three hours . 
Only at high tide . ''
