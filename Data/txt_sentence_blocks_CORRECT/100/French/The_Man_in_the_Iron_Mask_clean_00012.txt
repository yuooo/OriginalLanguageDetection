`` Admirable . '' 
`` Well , then ; this is the surprise we intend . 
M. Lebrun here is a man who draws most excellently . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Percerin ; `` I have seen his pictures , and observed that his dresses were highly elaborated . 
That is why I at once agreed to make him a costume - whether to agree with those of the Epicureans , or an original one . '' 
`` My dear monsieur , we accept your offer , and shall presently avail ourselves of it ; but just now , M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you will make for himself , but of those you are making for the king . '' 
Percerin made a bound backwards , which D'Artagnan - calmest and most appreciative of men , did not consider overdone , so many strange and startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded . 
`` The king 's dresses ! 
Give the king 's dresses to any mortal whatever ! 
Oh ! 
for once , monseigneur , your grace is mad ! '' 
cried the poor tailor in extremity . 
`` Help me now , D'Artagnan , '' said Aramis , more and more calm and smiling . 
`` Help me now to persuade monsieur , for you understand ; do you not ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! 
- not exactly , I declare . '' 
`` What ! 
you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux ; and that the portrait , which be a striking resemblance , ought to be dressed exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes , yes , '' said the musketeer , nearly convinced , so plausible was this reasoning . 
`` Yes , my dear Aramis , you are right ; it is a happy idea . 
I will wager it is one of your own , Aramis . '' 
`` Well , I do n't know , '' replied the bishop ; `` either mine or M. Fouquet 's . '' 
Then scanning Percerin , after noticing D'Artagnan 's hesitation , `` Well , Monsieur Percerin , '' he asked , `` what do you say to this ? '' 
`` I say , that - '' `` That you are , doubtless , free to refuse . 
I know well - and I by no means count upon compelling you , my dear monsieur . 
I will say more , I even understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet 's idea ; you dread appearing to flatter the king . 
A noble spirit , M. Percerin , a noble spirit ! '' 
The tailor stammered . 
`` It would , indeed , be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince , '' continued Aramis ; `` but as the surintendant told me , ` if Percerin refuse , tell him that it will not at all lower him in my opinion , and I shall always esteem him , only - ' '' '' ` Only ? ' '' 
repeated Percerin , rather troubled . '' 
` Only , ' '' continued Aramis , '' ' I shall be compelled to say to the king , ' -- you understand , my dear Monsieur Percerin , that these are M. Fouquet 's words , - ' I shall be constrained to say to the king , `` Sire , I had intended to present your majesty with your portrait , but owing to a feeling of delicacy , slightly exaggerated perhaps , although creditable , M. Percerin opposed the project . '' ' '' 
`` Opposed ! '' 
cried the tailor , terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him ; `` I to oppose the desire , the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to please the king ! 
Oh , what a hateful word you have uttered , monseigneur . 
Oppose ! 
Oh , 't is not I who said it , Heaven have mercy on me . 
I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it ! 
Is it not true , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that I have opposed nothing ? '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral . 
He felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it , whether comedy or tragedy ; he was at his wit 's end at not being able to fathom it , but in the meanwhile wished to keep clear . 
But already Percerin , goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he stood in the way of a pleasant surprise , had offered Lebrun a chair , and proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses , the fifth being still in the workmen 's hands ; and these masterpieces he successively fitted upon four lay figures , which , imported into France in the time of Concini , had been given to Percerin II . 
by Marshal d'Onore , after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their competition . 
The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses . 
But Aramis , who was closely watching all the phases of his toil , suddenly stopped him . 
`` I think you have not quite got it , my dear Lebrun , '' he said ; `` your colors will deceive you , and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance which is absolutely requisite . 
Time is necessary for attentively observing the finer shades . '' 
`` Quite true , '' said Percerin , `` but time is wanting , and on that head , you will agree with me , monseigneur , I can do nothing . '' 
`` Then the affair will fail , '' said Aramis , quietly , `` and that because of a want of precision in the colors . '' 
Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity - a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience . 
`` What in the world , now , is the meaning of this imbroglio ? '' 
the musketeer kept saying to himself . 
`` That will never do , '' said Aramis : `` M. Lebrun , close your box , and roll up your canvas . '' 
`` But , monsieur , '' cried the vexed painter , `` the light is abominable here . '' 
`` An idea , M. Lebrun , an idea ! 
If we had a pattern of the materials , for example , and with time , and a better light - '' `` Oh , then , '' cried Lebrun , `` I would answer for the effect . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing ; they want a pattern of each of the materials . 
Mordioux ! 
Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . '' 
Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes , Percerin put back the dresses into the closet , Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were secure , - and they all left the study . 
: Where , Probably , Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme . 
D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber ; but no longer an irritated Porthos , or a disappointed Porthos , but Porthos radiant , blooming , fascinating , and chattering with Moliere , who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry , and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater , but not even ever anything so great . 
Aramis went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand , which lost itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend , - an operation which Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness . 
But the friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him , the bishop of Vannes passed over to Moliere . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said he , `` will you come with me to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` I will go anywhere you like , monseigneur , '' answered Moliere . 
`` To Saint-Mande ! '' 
cried Porthos , surprised at seeing the proud bishop of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor . 
`` What , Aramis , are you going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically .
