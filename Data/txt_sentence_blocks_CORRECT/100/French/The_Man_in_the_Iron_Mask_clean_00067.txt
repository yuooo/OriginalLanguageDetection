`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . '' 
`` I will do all you may command , '' said Raoul , much agitated . 
`` It is not necessary , Raoul , that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into too hazardous enterprises . 
You have gone through your ordeal ; you are known to be a true man under fire . 
Remember that war with Arabs is a war of snares , ambuscades , and assassinations . '' 
`` So it is said , monsieur . '' 
`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults . 
Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you , Raoul ? 
God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters . '' 
`` I am naturally prudent , monsieur , and I have very good fortune , '' said Raoul , with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father ; `` for , '' the young man hastened to add , `` in twenty combats through which I have been , I have only received one scratch . '' 
`` There is in addition , '' said Athos , `` the climate to be dreaded : that is an ugly end , to die of fever ! 
King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague , rather than the fever . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
with sobriety , with reasonable exercise - '' `` I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France . 
You , as his aide - de-camp , will be charged with expediting them , and will be sure not to forget me . '' 
`` No , monsieur , '' said Raoul , almost choked with emotion . 
`` Besides , Raoul , as you are a good Christian , and I am one also , we ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels . 
Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you , on any occasion , you will think of me at once . '' 
`` First and at once ! 
Oh ! 
yes , monsieur . '' 
`` And will call upon me ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` You dream of me sometimes , do you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Every night , monsieur . 
During my early youth I saw you in my dreams , calm and mild , with one hand stretched out over my head , and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - formerly . '' 
`` We love each other too dearly , '' said the comte , `` that from this moment , in which we separate , a portion of both our souls should not travel with one and the other of us , and should not dwell wherever we may dwell . 
Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill . 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting , they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards , as if in indecision or ashamed to be seen . 
It was Grimaud , who in his anxiety had tracked his master , and was there awaiting him . 
`` Oh ! 
my good Grimaud , '' cried Raoul , `` what do you want ? 
You are come to tell us it is time to be gone , have you not ? '' 
`` Alone ? '' 
said Grimaud , addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of reproach , which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled . 
`` Oh ! 
you are right ! '' 
cried the comte . 
`` No , Raoul shall not go alone ; no , he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand to support him , some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved ! '' 
`` I ? '' 
said Grimaud . 
`` You , yes , you ! '' 
cried Raoul , touched to the inmost heart . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Athos , `` you are very old , my good Grimaud . '' 
`` So much the better , '' replied the latter , with an inexpressible depth of feeling and intelligence . 
`` But the embarkation is begun , '' said Raoul , `` and you are not prepared . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Grimaud , showing the keys of his trunks , mixed with those of his young master . 
`` But , '' again objected Raoul , `` you can not leave monsieur le comte thus alone ; monsieur le comte , whom you have never quitted ? '' 
Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul , as if to measure the strength of both . 
The comte uttered not a word . 
`` Monsieur le comte prefers my going , '' said Grimaud . 
`` I do , '' said Athos , by an inclination of the head . 
At that moment the drums suddenly rolled , and the clarions filled the air with their inspiring notes . 
The regiments destined for the expedition began to debouch from the city . 
They advanced to the number of five , each composed of forty companies . 
Royals marched first , distinguished by their white uniform , faced with blue . 
The ordonnance colors , quartered cross-wise , violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs-de - lis , left the white-colored flag , with its fleur-de-lised cross , to dominate the whole . 
Musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders ; pikemen in the center , with their lances , fourteen feet in length , marched gayly towards the transports , which carried them in detail to the ships . 
The regiments of Picardy , Navarre , Normandy , and Royal Vaisseau , followed after . 
M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops . 
He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would take a full hour before he could reach the sea . 
Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach , in order to take his place when the prince embarked . 
Grimaud , boiling with the ardor of a young man , superintended the embarkation of Raoul 's baggage in the admiral 's vessel . 
Athos , with his arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose , absorbed in melancholy meditation , was deaf to every noise around him . 
An officer came quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have him by his side . 
`` Have the kindness to tell the prince , '' said Raoul , `` that I request he will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Athos , `` an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his general . 
Please to tell the prince , monsieur , that the vicomte will join him immediately . '' 
The officer set off at a gallop . 
`` Whether we part here or part there , '' added the comte , `` it is no less a separation . '' 
He carefully brushed the dust from his son 's coat , and passed his hand over his hair as they walked along . 
`` But , Raoul , '' said he , `` you want money . 
M. de Beaufort 's train will be splendid , and I am certain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms , which are very dear things in Africa . 
Now , as you are not actually in the service of the king or M. de Beaufort , and are simply a volunteer , you must not reckon upon either pay or largesse . 
But I should not like you to want for anything at Gigelli . 
Here are two hundred pistoles ; if you would please me , Raoul , spend them . '' 
Raoul pressed the hand of his father , and , at the turning of a street , they saw M. de Beaufort , mounted on a magnificent white genet , which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city . 
The duke called Raoul , and held out his hand to the comte . 
He spoke to him for some time , with such a kindly expression that the heart of the poor father even felt a little comforted . 
It was , however , evident to both father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a punishment . 
There was a terrible moment - that at which , on quitting the sands of the shore , the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their families and friends ; a supreme moment , in which , notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens , the warmth of the sun , of the perfumes of the air , and the rich life that was circulating in their veins , everything appeared black , everything bitter , everything created doubts of Providence , nay , at the most , of God . 
It was customary for the admiral and his suite to embark last ; the cannon waited to announce , with its formidable voice , that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel .
