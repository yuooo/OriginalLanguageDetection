- To the castle , then ! '' 
He returned thither . 
M. de Lyonne was coming out . 
He gave D'Artagnan both hands , but told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening and all night , and that orders had been given that no one should be admitted . 
`` Not even the captain who takes the order ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I think that is rather too strong . '' 
`` Not even he , '' said M. de Lyonne . 
`` Since that is the case , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the heart ; `` since the captain of the musketeers , who has always entered the king 's chamber , is no longer allowed to enter it , his cabinet , or his salle-a - manger , either the king is dead , or his captain is in disgrace . 
Do me the favor , then , M. de Lyonne , who are in favor , to return and tell the king , plainly , I send him my resignation . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , beware of what you are doing ! '' 
`` For friendship 's sake , go ! '' 
and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet . 
`` Well , I will go , '' said Lyonne . 
D'Artagnan waited , walking about the corridor in no enviable mood . 
Lyonne returned . 
`` Well , what did the king say ? '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` He simply answered , '' Tis well , ' '' replied Lyonne . 
`` That it was well ! '' 
said the captain , with an explosion . 
`` That is to say , that he accepts it ? 
Good ! 
Now , then , I am free ! 
I am only a plain citizen , M. de Lyonne . 
I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye ! 
Farewell , castle , corridor , ante-chamber ! 
a bourgeois , about to breathe at liberty , takes his farewell of you . '' 
And without waiting longer , the captain sprang from the terrace down the staircase , where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville 's letter . 
Five minutes after , he was at the hostelry , where , according to the custom of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle , he had taken what was called his city-chamber . 
But when he arrived there , instead of throwing off his sword and cloak , he took his pistols , put his money into a large leather purse , sent for his horses from the castle - stables , and gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes during the night . 
Everything went on according to his wishes . 
At eight o'clock in the evening , he was putting his foot in the stirrup , when M. de Gesvres appeared , at the head of twelve guards , in front of the hostelry . 
D'Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye ; he could not fail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses . 
But he feigned not to observe anything , and was about to put his horse in motion . 
Gesvres rode up to him . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
said he , aloud . 
`` Ah , Monsieur de Gesvres ! 
good evening ! '' 
`` One would say you were getting on horseback . '' 
`` More than that , - I am mounted , - as you see . '' 
`` It is fortunate I have met with you . '' 
`` Were you looking for me , then ? '' 
`` Mon Dieu ! 
yes . '' 
`` On the part of the king , I will wager ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` As I , three days ago , went in search of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` Nonsense ! 
It is of no use being over-delicate with me ; that is all labor lost . 
Tell me at once you are come to arrest me . '' 
`` To arrest you ? 
- Good heavens ! 
no . '' 
`` Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels , then ? '' 
`` I am making my round . '' 
`` That is n't bad ! 
And so you pick me up in your round , eh ? '' 
`` I do n't pick you up ; I meet with you , and I beg you to come with me . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` To the king . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a bantering air ; `` the king is disengaged . '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , captain , '' said M. de Gesvres , in a low voice to the musketeer , `` do not compromise yourself ! 
these men hear you . '' 
D'Artagnan laughed aloud , and replied : `` March ! 
People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards and the six last . '' 
`` But as I am not arresting you , '' said M. de Gesvres , `` you will march behind , with me , if you please . '' 
`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is very polite , duke , and you are right in being so ; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your chambre-de - ville , I should have been courteous to you , I assure you , on the word of a gentleman ! 
Now , one favor more ; what does the king want with me ? '' 
`` Oh , the king is furious ! '' 
`` Very well ! 
the king , who has thought it worth while to be angry , may take the trouble to grow calm again ; that is all . 
I sha n't die of that , I will swear . '' 
`` No , but - '' `` But - I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet . 
Mordioux ! 
That is a gallant man , a worthy man ! 
We shall live very sociably together , I will be sworn . '' 
`` Here we are at our place of destination , '' said the duke . 
`` Captain , for Heaven 's sake be calm with the king ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! 
you are playing the brave man with me , duke ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres . 
`` I have been told that you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers . 
This strikes me as a splendid opportunity . '' 
`` I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it , captain . '' 
`` And why not , pray ? '' 
`` Oh , for many reasons - in the first place , for this : if I were to succeed you in the musketeers after having arrested you - '' `` Ah ! 
then you admit you have arrested me ? '' 
`` No , I do n't . '' 
`` Say met me , then . 
So , you were saying if you were to succeed me after having arrested me ? '' 
`` Your musketeers , at the first exercise with ball cartridges , would fire my way , by mistake . '' 
`` Oh , as to that I wo n't say ; for the fellows do love me a little . '' 
Gesvres made D'Artagnan pass in first , and took him straight to the cabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers , and placed himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber . 
The king could be heard distinctly , speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where Colbert might have heard , a few days before , the king speaking aloud with M. d'Artagnan . 
The guards remained as a mounted picket before the principal gate ; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city that monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order of the king .
