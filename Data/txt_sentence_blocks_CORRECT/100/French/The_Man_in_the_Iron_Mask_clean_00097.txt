`` Tell me what ? '' 
`` These people are coming down into the grotto . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` We could kill about fifteen of them , but no more . '' 
`` How many are there in all ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men . '' 
`` Seventy-five and five , eighty . 
Ah ! '' 
sighed Porthos . 
`` If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls . '' 
`` Certainly they will . '' 
`` Without reckoning , '' added Aramis , `` that the detonation might occasion a collapse of the cavern . '' 
`` Ay , '' said Porthos , `` a piece of falling rock just now grazed my shoulder . '' 
`` You see , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is nothing . '' 
`` We must determine upon something quickly . 
Our Bretons are going to continue to roll the canoe towards the sea . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
`` We two will keep the powder , the balls , and the muskets here . '' 
`` But only two , my dear Aramis - we shall never fire three shots together , '' said Porthos , innocently , `` the defense by musketry is a bad one . '' 
`` Find a better , then . '' 
`` I have found one , '' said the giant , eagerly ; `` I will place myself in ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar , and invisible , unattackable , if they come in floods , I can let my bar fall upon their skulls , thirty times in a minute . 
Hein ! 
what do you think of the project ? 
You smile ! '' 
`` Excellent , dear friend , perfect ! 
I approve it greatly ; only you will frighten them , and half of them will remain outside to take us by famine . 
What we want , my good friend , is the entire destruction of the troop . 
A single survivor encompasses our ruin . '' 
`` You are right , my friend , but how can we attract them , pray ? '' 
`` By not stirring , my good Porthos . '' 
`` Well ! 
we wo n't stir , then ; but when they are all together - '' `` Then leave it to me , I have an idea . '' 
`` If it is so , and your idea proves a good one - and your idea is most likely to be good - I am satisfied . '' 
`` To your ambuscade , Porthos , and count how many enter . '' 
`` But you , what will you do ? '' 
`` Do n't trouble yourself about me ; I have a task to perform . '' 
`` I think I hear shouts . '' 
`` It is they ! 
To your post . 
Keep within reach of my voice and hand . '' 
Porthos took refuge in the second compartment , which was in darkness , absolutely black . 
Aramis glided into the third ; the giant held in his hand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight . 
Porthos handled this lever , which had been used in rolling the bark , with marvelous facility . 
During this time , the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach . 
In the further and lighter compartment , Aramis , stooping and concealed , was busy with some mysterious maneuver . 
A command was given in a loud voice . 
It was the last order of the captain commandant . 
Twenty-five men jumped from the upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto , and having taken their ground , began to fire . 
The echoes shrieked and barked , the hissing balls seemed actually to rarefy the air , and then opaque smoke filled the vault . 
`` To the left ! 
to the left ! '' 
cried Biscarrat , who , in his first assault , had seen the passage to the second chamber , and who , animated by the smell of powder , wished to guide his soldiers in that direction . 
The troop , accordingly , precipitated themselves to the left - the passage gradually growing narrower . 
Biscarrat , with his hands stretched forward , devoted to death , marched in advance of the muskets . 
`` Come on ! 
come on ! '' 
exclaimed he , `` I see daylight ! '' 
`` Strike , Porthos ! '' 
cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis . 
Porthos breathed a heavy sigh - but he obeyed . 
The iron bar fell full and direct upon the head of Biscarrat , who was dead before he had ended his cry . 
Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds , and made ten corpses . 
The soldiers could see nothing ; they heard sighs and groans ; they stumbled over dead bodies , but as they had no conception of the cause of all this , they came forward jostling each other . 
The implacable bar , still falling , annihilated the first platoon , without a single sound to warn the second , which was quietly advancing ; only , commanded by the captain , the men had stripped a fir , growing on the shore , and , with its resinous branches twisted together , the captain had made a flambeau . 
On arriving at the compartment where Porthos , like the exterminating angel , had destroyed all he touched , the first rank drew back in terror . 
No firing had replied to that of the guards , and yet their way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies - they literally walked in blood . 
Porthos was still behind his pillar . 
The captain , illumining with trembling pine-torch this frightful carnage , of which he in vain sought the cause , drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was concealed . 
Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade , and fastened on the throat of the captain , who uttered a stifle rattle ; his stretched-out arms beating the air , the torch fell and was extinguished in blood . 
A second after , the corpse of the captain dropped close to the extinguished torch , and added another body to the heap of dead which blocked up the passage . 
All this was effected as mysteriously as though by magic . 
At hearing the rattling in the throat of the captain , the soldiers who accompanied him had turned round , caught a glimpse of his extended arms , his eyes starting from their sockets , and then the torch fell and they were left in darkness . 
From an unreflective , instinctive , mechanical feeling , the lieutenant cried : `` Fire ! '' 
Immediately a volley of musketry flamed , thundered , roared in the cavern , bringing down enormous fragments from the vaults . 
The cavern was lighted for an instant by this discharge , and then immediately returned to pitchy darkness rendered thicker by the smoke . 
To this succeeded a profound silence , broken only by the steps of the third brigade , now entering the cavern . 
: The Death of a Titan . 
At the moment when Porthos , more accustomed to the darkness than these men , coming from open daylight , was looking round him to see if through this artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal , he felt his arm gently touched , and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear , `` Come . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis , if possible , yet more softly . 
And amidst the noise of the third brigade , which continued to advance , the imprecations of the guards still left alive , the muffled groans of the dying , Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the cavern . 
Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment , and showed him , in a hollow of the rocky wall , a barrel of powder weighing from seventy to eighty pounds , to which he had just attached a fuse . 
`` My friend , '' said he to Porthos , `` you will take this barrel , the match of which I am going to set fire to , and throw it amidst our enemies ; can you do so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
replied Porthos ; and he lifted the barrel with one hand . 
`` Light it ! '' 
`` Stop , '' said Aramis , `` till they are all massed together , and then , my Jupiter , hurl your thunderbolt among them . '' 
`` Light it , '' repeated Porthos . 
`` On my part , '' continued Aramis , `` I will join our Bretons , and help them to get the canoe to the sea . 
I will wait for you on the shore ; launch it strongly , and hasten to us . '' 
`` Light it , '' said Porthos , a third time . 
`` But do you understand me ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Porthos again , with laughter that he did not even attempt to restrain , `` when a thing is explained to me I understand it ; begone , and give me the light . '' 
Aramis gave the burning match to Porthos , who held out his arm to him , his hands being engaged .
