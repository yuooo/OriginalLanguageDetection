Yves waved a white cloth at the end of a gaff . 
This was like striking their flag . 
The pursuer came on like a race-horse . 
It launched a fresh Greek fire , which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe , and threw a light upon them as white as sunshine . 
`` At the first sign of resistance , '' cried the commander of the balancelle , `` fire ! '' 
The soldiers brought their muskets to the present . 
`` Did we not say we surrendered ? '' 
said Yves . 
`` Alive , alive , captain ! '' 
cried one excited soldier , `` they must be taken alive . '' 
`` Well , yes - living , '' said the captain . 
Then turning towards the Bretons , `` Your lives are safe , my friends ! '' 
cried he , `` all but the Chevalier d'Herblay . '' 
Aramis stared imperceptibly . 
For an instant his eye was fixed upon the depths of the ocean , illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire , which ran along the sides of the waves , played on the crests like plumes , and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they covered . 
`` Do you hear , monseigneur ? '' 
said the sailors . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What are your orders ? '' 
`` Accept ! '' 
`` But you , monseigneur ? '' 
Aramis leaned still more forward , and dipped the ends of his long white fingers in the green limpid waters of the sea , to which he turned with smiles as to a friend . 
`` Accept ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` We accept , '' repeated the sailors ; `` but what security have we ? '' 
`` The word of a gentleman , '' said the officer . 
`` By my rank and by my name I swear that all except M. le Chevalier d'Herblay shall have their lives spared . 
I am lieutenant of the king 's frigate the ` Pomona , ' and my name is Louis Constant de Pressigny . '' 
With a rapid gesture , Aramis - already bent over the side of the bark towards the sea - drew himself up , and with a flashing eye , and a smile upon his lips , `` Throw out the ladder , messieurs , '' said he , as if the command had belonged to him . 
He was obeyed . 
When Aramis , seizing the rope ladder , walked straight up to the commander , with a firm step , looked at him earnestly , made a sign to him with his hand , a mysterious and unknown sign at sight of which the officer turned pale , trembled , and bowed his head , the sailors were profoundly astonished . 
Without a word Aramis then raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed him the collet of a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand . 
And while making this sign Aramis , draped in cold and haughty majesty , had the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed . 
The commandant , who for a moment had raised his head , bowed a second time with marks of the most profound respect . 
Then stretching his hand out , in his turn , towards the poop , that is to say , towards his own cabin , he drew back to allow Aramis to go first . 
The three Bretons , who had come on board after their bishop , looked at each other , stupefied . 
The crew were awed to silence . 
Five minutes after , the commander called the second lieutenant , who returned immediately , ordering the head to be put towards Corunna . 
Whilst this order was being executed , Aramis reappeared upon the deck , and took a seat near the bastingage . 
Night had fallen ; the moon had not yet risen , yet Aramis looked incessantly towards Belle-Isle . 
Yves then approached the captain , who had returned to take his post in the stern , and said , in a low and humble voice , `` What course are we to follow , captain ? '' 
`` We take what course monseigneur pleases , '' replied the officer . 
Aramis passed the night leaning upon the bastingage . 
Yves , on approaching him next morning , remarked that `` the night must have been a very damp one , for the wood on which the bishop 's head had rested was soaked with dew . '' 
Who knows ? 
- that dew was , it may be , the first tears that had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis ! 
What epitaph would have been worth that , good Porthos ? 
: M. de Gesvres 's Round . 
D'Artagnan was little used to resistance like that he had just experienced . 
He returned , profoundly irritated , to Nantes . 
Irritation , with this vigorous man , usually vented itself in impetuous attack , which few people , hitherto , were they king , were they giants , had been able to resist . 
Trembling with rage , he went straight to the castle , and asked an audience with the king . 
It might be about seven o'clock in the morning , and , since his arrival at Nantes , the king had been an early riser . 
But on arriving at the corridor with which we are acquainted , D'Artagnan found M. de Gesvres , who stopped him politely , telling him not to speak too loud and disturb the king . 
`` Is the king asleep ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Well , I will let him sleep . 
But about what o'clock do you suppose he will rise ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
in about two hours ; his majesty has been up all night . '' 
D'Artagnan took his hat again , bowed to M. de Gesvres , and returned to his own apartments . 
He came back at half-past nine , and was told that the king was at breakfast . 
`` That will just suit me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I will talk to the king while he is eating . '' 
M. de Brienne reminded D'Artagnan that the king would not see any one at meal-time . 
`` But , '' said D'Artagnan , looking askant at Brienne , `` you do not know , perhaps , monsieur , that I have the privilege of entree anywhere - and at any hour . '' 
Brienne took the captain 's hand kindly , and said , `` Not at Nantes , dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
The king , in this journey , has changed everything . '' 
D'Artagnan , a little softened , asked about what o'clock the king would have finished his breakfast . 
`` We do n't know . '' 
`` Eh ? 
- do n't know ! 
What does that mean ? 
You do n't know how much time the king devotes to eating ? 
It is generally an hour ; and , if we admit that the air of the Loire gives an additional appetite , we will extend it to an hour and a half ; that is enough , I think . 
I will wait where I am . '' 
`` Oh ! 
dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , the order of the day is not to allow any person to remain in this corridor ; I am on guard for that particular purpose . '' 
D'Artagnan felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time . 
He went out quickly , for fear of complicating the affair by a display of premature ill-humor . 
As soon as he was out he began to reflect . 
`` The king , '' said he , `` will not receive me , that is evident . 
The young man is angry ; he is afraid , beforehand , of the words that I may speak to him . 
Yes ; but in the meantime Belle-Isle is besieged , and my two friends by now probably taken or killed . 
Poor Porthos ! 
As to Master Aramis , he is always full of resources , and I am easy on his account . 
But , no , no ; Porthos is not yet an invalid , nor is Aramis in his dotage . 
The one with his arm , the other with his imagination , will find work for his majesty 's soldiers . 
Who knows if these brave men may not get up for the edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of Saint - Gervais ! 
I do n't despair of it . 
They have cannon and a garrison . 
And yet , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I do n't know whether it would not be better to stop the combat . 
For myself alone I will not put up with either surly looks or insults from the king ; but for my friends I must put up with everything . 
Shall I go to M. Colbert ? 
Now , there is a man I must acquire the habit of terrifying . 
I will go to M. Colbert . '' 
And D'Artagnan set forward bravely to find M. Colbert , but was informed that he was working with the king , at the castle of Nantes . 
`` Good ! '' 
cried he , `` the times have come again in which I measured my steps from De Treville to the cardinal , from the cardinal to the queen , from the queen to Louis XIII . 
Truly is it said that men , in growing old , become children again !
