Where did you go ? 
Why have you stayed away so long ? 
Formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days . 
I sent Nicolette , the answer always was : ` He is absent . ' 
How long have you been back ? 
Why did you not let us know ? 
Do you know that you are very much changed ? 
Ah ! 
what a naughty father ! 
he has been ill , and we have not known it ! 
Stay , Marius , feel how cold his hand is ! '' 
`` So you are here ! 
Monsieur Pontmercy , you pardon me ! '' 
repeated Jean Valjean . 
At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more , all that was swelling Marius ' heart found vent . 
He burst forth : `` Cosette , do you hear ? 
he has come to that ! 
he asks my forgiveness ! 
And do you know what he has done for me , Cosette ? 
He has saved my life . 
He has done more -- he has given you to me . 
And after having saved me , and after having given you to me , Cosette , what has he done with himself ? 
He has sacrificed himself . 
Behold the man . 
And he says to me the ingrate , to me the forgetful , to me the pitiless , to me the guilty one : Thanks ! 
Cosette , my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little . 
That barricade , that sewer , that furnace , that cesspool , -- all that he traversed for me , for thee , Cosette ! 
He carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me , and accepted for himself . 
Every courage , every virtue , every heroism , every sanctity he possesses ! 
Cosette , that man is an angel ! '' 
`` Hush ! 
hush ! '' 
said Jean Valjean in a low voice . 
`` Why tell all that ? '' 
`` But you ! '' 
cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration , `` why did you not tell it to me ? 
It is your own fault , too . 
You save people 's lives , and you conceal it from them ! 
You do more , under the pretext of unmasking yourself , you calumniate yourself . 
It is frightful . '' 
`` I told the truth , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` No , '' retorted Marius , `` the truth is the whole truth ; and that you did not tell . 
You were Monsieur Madeleine , why not have said so ? 
You saved Javert , why not have said so ? 
I owed my life to you , why not have said so ? '' 
`` Because I thought as you do . 
I thought that you were in the right . 
It was necessary that I should go away . 
If you had known about that affair , of the sewer , you would have made me remain near you . 
I was therefore forced to hold my peace . 
If I had spoken , it would have caused embarrassment in every way . '' 
`` It would have embarrassed what ? 
embarrassed whom ? '' 
retorted Marius . 
`` Do you think that you are going to stay here ? 
We shall carry you off . 
Ah ! 
good heavens ! 
when I reflect that it was by an accident that I have learned all this . 
You form a part of ourselves . 
You are her father , and mine . 
You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house . 
Do not imagine that you will be here to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I shall not be here , but I shall not be with you . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
replied Marius . 
`` Ah ! 
come now , we are not going to permit any more journeys . 
You shall never leave us again . 
You belong to us . 
We shall not loose our hold of you . '' 
`` This time it is for good , '' added Cosette . 
`` We have a carriage at the door . 
I shall run away with you . 
If necessary , I shall employ force . '' 
And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms . 
`` Your chamber still stands ready in our house , '' she went on . 
`` If you only knew how pretty the garden is now ! 
The azaleas are doing very well there . 
The walks are sanded with river sand ; there are tiny violet shells . 
You shall eat my strawberries . 
I water them myself . 
And no more ` madame , ' no more ` Monsieur Jean , ' we are living under a Republic , everybody says thou , do n't they , Marius ? 
The programme is changed . 
If you only knew , father , I have had a sorrow , there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall , and a horrible cat ate her . 
My poor , pretty , little robin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me ! 
I cried over it . 
I should have liked to kill the cat . 
But now nobody cries any more . 
Everybody laughs , everybody is happy . 
You are going to come with us . 
How delighted grandfather will be ! 
You shall have your plot in the garden , you shall cultivate it , and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine . 
And , then , I shall do everything that you wish , and then , you will obey me prettily . '' 
Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her . 
He heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words ; one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes . 
He murmured : `` The proof that God is good is that she is here . '' 
`` Father ! '' 
said Cosette . 
Jean Valjean continued : `` It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together .
