You have not replaced her . 
Why ? '' 
`` Nicolette suffices . '' 
`` But you ought to have a maid . '' 
`` Have I not Marius ? '' 
`` You ought to have a house of your own , your own servants , a carriage , a box at the theatre . 
There is nothing too fine for you . 
Why not profit by your riches ? 
Wealth adds to happiness . '' 
Cosette made no reply . 
Jean Valjean 's visits were not abridged . 
Far from it . 
When it is the heart which is slipping , one does not halt on the downward slope . 
When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour , he sang the praises of Marius ; he pronounced him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good . 
Cosette outdid him . 
Jean Valjean began again . 
They were never weary . 
Marius -- that word was inexhaustible ; those six letters contained volumes . 
In this manner , Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time . 
It was so sweet to see Cosette , to forget by her side ! 
It alleviated his wounds . 
It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce : `` M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served . '' 
On those days , Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home . 
Was there , then , any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of Marius ? 
Was Jean Valjean really a chrysalis who would persist , and who would come to visit his butterfly ? 
One day he remained still longer than usual . 
On the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth . 
-- `` Hello ! '' 
he thought . 
`` No fire . '' 
-- And he furnished the explanation for himself . 
-- `` It is perfectly simple . 
It is April . 
The cold weather has ceased . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how cold it is here ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette when she entered . 
`` Why , no , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then ? '' 
`` Yes , since we are now in the month of May . '' 
`` But we have a fire until June . 
One is needed all the year in this cellar . '' 
`` I thought that a fire was unnecessary . '' 
`` That is exactly like one of your ideas ! '' 
retorted Cosette . 
On the following day there was a fire . 
But the two arm-chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door . '' 
-- What is the meaning of this ? '' 
thought Jean Valjean . 
He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth . 
This fire lighted once more encouraged him , however . 
He prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits . 
As he rose to take his leave , Cosette said to him : `` My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday . '' 
`` What was it ? '' 
`` He said to me : ` Cosette , we have an income of thirty thousand livres . 
Twenty-seven that you own , and three that my grandfather gives me . ' 
I replied : ` That makes thirty . ' 
He went on : ` Would you have the courage to live on the three thousand ? ' 
I answered : ` Yes , on nothing . 
Provided that it was with you . ' 
And then I asked : ` Why do you say that to me ? ' 
He replied : ` I wanted to know . ' '' 
Jean Valjean found not a word to answer . 
Cosette probably expected some explanation from him ; he listened in gloomy silence . 
He went back to the Rue de l'Homme Arme ; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house , he entered the adjoining dwelling . 
It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again . 
His mind was swarming with conjectures . 
It was evident that Marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs , that he feared some source that was not pure , who knows ? 
that he had even , perhaps , discovered that the money came from him , Jean Valjean , that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune , and was disinclined to take it as his own , -- preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor , rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean . 
Moreover , Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door . 
On the following day , he underwent something like a shock on entering the ground-floor room . 
The arm-chairs had disappeared . 
There was not a single chair of any sort . 
`` Ah , what 's this ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette as she entered , `` no chairs ! 
Where are the arm-chairs ? '' 
`` They are no longer here , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` This is too much ! '' 
Jean Valjean stammered : `` It was I who told Basque to remove them . '' 
`` And your reason ? '' 
`` I have only a few minutes to stay to-day . '' 
`` A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing . '' 
`` I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` You have company this evening , no doubt . '' 
`` We expect no one . '' 
Jean Valjean had not another word to say . 
Cosette shrugged her shoulders . 
`` To have the chairs carried off ! 
The other day you had the fire put out . 
How odd you are ! '' 
`` Adieu ! '' 
murmured Jean Valjean . 
He did not say : `` Adieu , Cosette . '' 
But he had not the strength to say : `` Adieu , Madame . '' 
He went away utterly overwhelmed . 
This time he had understood . 
On the following day he did not come . 
Cosette only observed the fact in the evening . 
`` Why , '' said she , `` Monsieur Jean has not been here today . ''
