How will you break through the bolts and bars ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , - how did you get the note which announced my arrival to you ? '' 
`` You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note . '' 
`` If we can corrupt one turnkey , we can corrupt ten . '' 
`` Well ; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile ; possible so to conceal him that the king 's people shall not again ensnare him ; possible , in some unknown retreat , to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
said Aramis , smiling . 
`` I admit that , whoever would do this much for me , would seem more than mortal in my eyes ; but as you tell me I am a prince , brother of the king , how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of ? 
And as , to effect this , I must pass a life of war and hatred , how can you cause me to prevail in those combats - render me invulnerable by my enemies ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , reflect on all this ; place me , to-morrow , in some dark cavern at a mountain 's base ; yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river , plain and valley , of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens , or the stormy sky , and it is enough . 
Promise me no more than this , for , indeed , more you can not give , and it would be a crime to deceive me , since you call yourself my friend . '' 
Aramis waited in silence . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , after a moment 's reflection , `` I admire the firm , sound sense which dictates your words ; I am happy to have discovered my monarch 's mind . '' 
`` Again , again ! 
oh , God ! 
for mercy 's sake , '' cried the prince , pressing his icy hands upon his clammy brow , `` do not play with me ! 
I have no need to be a king to be the happiest of men . '' 
`` But I , monseigneur , wish you to be a king for the good of humanity . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the prince , with fresh distrust inspired by the word ; `` ah ! 
with what , then , has humanity to reproach my brother ? '' 
`` I forgot to say , monseigneur , that if you would allow me to guide you , and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom , you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause , and these friends are numerous . '' 
`` Numerous ? '' 
`` Less numerous than powerful , monseigneur . '' 
`` Explain yourself . '' 
`` It is impossible ; I will explain , I swear before Heaven , on that day that I see you sitting on the throne of France . '' 
`` But my brother ? '' 
`` You shall decree his fate . 
Do you pity him ? '' 
`` Him , who leaves me to perish in a dungeon ? 
No , no . 
For him I have no pity ! '' 
`` So much the better . '' 
`` He might have himself come to this prison , have taken me by the hand , and have said , ` My brother , Heaven created us to love , not to contend with one another . 
I come to you . 
A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity , far from mankind , deprived of every joy . 
I will make you sit down beside me ; I will buckle round your waist our father 's sword . 
Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me ? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood ? ' 
` Oh ! 
never , ' I would have replied to him , ' I look on you as my preserver , I will respect you as my master . 
You give me far more than Heaven bestowed ; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world . ' '' 
`` And you would have kept your word , monseigneur ? '' 
`` On my life ! 
While now - now that I have guilty ones to punish - '' `` In what manner , monseigneur ? '' 
`` What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother ? '' 
`` I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded ; I say that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike , of her own flesh , and I conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium . '' 
`` By which you mean - '' `` That if I restore you to your place on your brother 's throne , he shall take yours in prison . '' 
`` Alas ! 
there 's such infinity of suffering in prison , especially it would be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment . '' 
`` Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire ; and if it seems good to you , after punishment , you will have it in your power to pardon . '' 
`` Good . 
And now , are you aware of one thing , monsieur ? '' 
`` Tell me , my prince . '' 
`` It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the Bastile . '' 
`` I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the pleasure of seeing you once again . '' 
`` And when ? '' 
`` The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how will you give me notice of it ? '' 
`` By myself coming to fetch you . '' 
`` Yourself ? '' 
`` My prince , do not leave this chamber save with me , or if in my absence you are compelled to do so , remember that I am not concerned in it . '' 
`` And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever , save to you ? '' 
`` Save only to me . '' 
Aramis bowed very low . 
The prince offered his hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , in a tone that issued from his heart , `` one word more , my last . 
If you have sought me for my destruction ; if you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies ; if from our conference , in which you have sounded the depths of my mind , anything worse than captivity result , that is to say , if death befall me , still receive my blessing , for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long , weary years . '' 
`` Monseigneur , wait the results ere you judge me , '' said Aramis . 
`` I say that , in such a case , I bless and forgive you . 
If , on the other hand , you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven ; if by your means I am enabled to live in the memory of man , and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor , or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people ; if , from my present depths of sorrow , aided by your generous hand , I raise myself to the very height of honor , then to you , whom I thank with blessings , to you will I offer half my power and my glory : though you would still be but partly recompensed , and your share must always remain incomplete , since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Aramis , moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man , `` the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration . 
It is not you who will have to thank me , but rather the nation whom you will render happy , the posterity whose name you will make glorious . 
Yes ; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than life , I shall have given you immortality . '' 
The prince offered his hand to Aramis , who sank upon his knee and kissed it . 
`` It is the first act of homage paid to our future king , '' said he . 
`` When I see you again , I shall say , ` Good day , sire . ' '' 
`` Till then , '' said the young man , pressing his wan and wasted fingers over his heart , - `` till then , no more dreams , no more strain on my life - my heart would break ! 
Oh , monsieur , how small is my prison - how low the window - how narrow are the doors ! 
To think that so much pride , splendor , and happiness , should be able to enter in and to remain here ! '' 
`` Your royal highness makes me proud , '' said Aramis , `` since you infer it is I who brought all this . '' 
And he rapped immediately on the door . 
The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux , who , devoured by fear and uneasiness , was beginning , in spite of himself , to listen at the door . 
Happily , neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice , even in the most passionate outbreaks . 
`` What a confessor ! '' 
said the governor , forcing a laugh ; `` who would believe that a compulsory recluse , a man as though in the very jaws of death , could have committed crimes so numerous , and so long to tell of ? '' 
Aramis made no reply . 
He was eager to leave the Bastile , where the secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls . 
As soon as they reached Baisemeaux 's quarters , `` Let us proceed to business , my dear governor , '' said Aramis . 
`` Alas ! '' 
replied Baisemeaux . 
`` You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres , '' said the bishop . 
`` And to pay over the first third of the sum , '' added the poor governor , with a sigh , taking three steps towards his iron strong-box . 
`` Here is the receipt , '' said Aramis . 
`` And here is the money , '' returned Baisemeaux , with a threefold sigh . 
`` The order instructed me only to give a receipt ; it said nothing about receiving the money , '' rejoined Aramis . 
`` Adieu , monsieur le governeur ! '' 
And he departed , leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile .
