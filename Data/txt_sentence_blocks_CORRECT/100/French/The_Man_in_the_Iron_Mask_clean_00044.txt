`` Have you thought , '' continued Fouquet , becoming animated with that strength of talent which in a few seconds originates , and matures the conception of a plan , and with that largeness of view which foresees all consequences , and embraces every result at a glance - `` have you thought that we must assemble the nobility , the clergy , and the third estate of the realm ; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign , to disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father , to sacrifice the life , the honor of a woman , Anne of Austria , the life and peace of mind and heart of another woman , Maria Theresa ; and suppose that it were all done , if we were to succeed in doing it - '' `` I do not understand you , '' continued Aramis , coldly . 
`` There is not a single syllable of sense in all you have just said . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said the superintendent , surprised , `` a man like you refuse to view the practical bearing of the case ! 
Do you confine yourself to the childish delight of a political illusion , and neglect the chances of its being carried into execution ; in other words , the reality itself , is it possible ? '' 
`` My friend , '' said Aramis , emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful familiarity , `` what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for another ? '' 
`` Heaven ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet - `` Heaven gives directions to its agent , who seizes upon the doomed victim , hurries him away , and seats the triumphant rival on the empty throne . 
But you forget that this agent is called death . 
Oh ! 
Monsieur d'Herblay , in Heaven 's name , tell me if you have had the idea - '' `` There is no question of that , monseigneur ; you are going beyond the object in view . 
Who spoke of Louis XIV . 
's death ? 
who spoke of adopting the example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution of its decrees ? 
No , I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its purposes without confusion or disturbance , without exciting comment or remark , without difficulty or exertion ; and that men , inspired by Heaven , succeed like Heaven itself , in all their undertakings , in all they attempt , in all they do . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I mean , my friend , '' returned Aramis , with the same intonation on the word friend that he had applied to it the first time - `` I mean that if there has been any confusion , scandal , and even effort in the substitution of the prisoner for the king , I defy you to prove it . '' 
`` What ! '' 
cried Fouquet , whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped his temples , `` what do you say ? '' 
`` Go to the king 's apartment , '' continued Aramis , tranquilly , `` and you who know the mystery , I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the Bastile is lying in his brother 's bed . '' 
`` But the king , '' stammered Fouquet , seized with horror at the intelligence . 
`` What king ? '' 
said Aramis , in his gentlest tone ; `` the one who hates you , or the one who likes you ? '' 
`` The king - of - yesterday . '' 
`` The king of yesterday ! 
be quite easy on that score ; he has gone to take the place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years . '' 
`` Great God ! 
And who took him there ? '' 
`` I. '' `` You ? '' 
`` Yes , and in the simplest way . 
I carried him away last night . 
While he was descending into midnight , the other was ascending into day . 
I do not think there has been any disturbance whatever . 
A flash of lightning without thunder awakens nobody . '' 
Fouquet uttered a thick , smothered cry , as if he had been struck by some invisible blow , and clasping his head between his clenched hands , he murmured : `` You did that ? '' 
`` Cleverly enough , too ; what do you think of it ? '' 
`` You dethroned the king ? 
imprisoned him , too ? '' 
`` Yes , that has been done . '' 
`` And such an action was committed here , at Vaux ? '' 
`` Yes , here , at Vaux , in the Chamber of Morpheus . 
It would almost seem that it had been built in anticipation of such an act . '' 
`` And at what time did it occur ? '' 
`` Last night , between twelve and one o'clock . '' 
Fouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon Aramis ; he restrained himself . 
`` At Vaux ; under my roof ! '' 
he said , in a half-strangled voice . 
`` I believe so ! 
for it is still your house , and it is likely to continue so , since M. Colbert can not rob you of it now . '' 
`` It was under my roof , then , monsieur , that you committed this crime ? '' 
`` This crime ? '' 
said Aramis , stupefied . 
`` This abominable crime ! '' 
pursued Fouquet , becoming more and more excited ; `` this crime more execrable than an assassination ! 
this crime which dishonors my name forever , and entails upon me the horror of posterity . '' 
`` You are not in your senses , monsieur , '' replied Aramis , in an irresolute tone of voice ; `` you are speaking too loudly ; take care ! '' 
`` I will call out so loudly , that the whole world shall hear me . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , take care ! '' 
Fouquet turned round towards the prelate , whom he looked at full in the face . 
`` You have dishonored me , '' he said , `` in committing so foul an act of treason , so heinous a crime upon my guest , upon one who was peacefully reposing beneath my roof . 
Oh ! 
woe , woe is me ! '' 
`` Woe to the man , rather , who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of your fortune , your life . 
Do you forget that ? '' 
`` He was my guest , my sovereign . '' 
Aramis rose , his eyes literally bloodshot , his mouth trembling convulsively . 
`` Have I a man out of his senses to deal with ? '' 
he said . 
`` You have an honorable man to deal with . '' 
`` You are mad . '' 
`` A man who will prevent you consummating your crime . '' 
`` You are mad , I say . '' 
`` A man who would sooner , oh ! 
far sooner , die ; who would kill you even , rather than allow you to complete his dishonor . '' 
And Fouquet snatched up his sword , which D'Artagnan had placed at the head of his bed , and clenched it resolutely in his hand . 
Aramis frowned , and thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon . 
This movement did not escape Fouquet , who , full of nobleness and pride in his magnanimity , threw his sword to a distance from him , and approached Aramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` I would sooner die here on the spot than survive this terrible disgrace ; and if you have any pity left for me , I entreat you to take my life . '' 
Aramis remained silent and motionless . 
`` You do not reply ? '' 
said Fouquet . 
Aramis raised his head gently , and a glimmer of hope might be seen once more to animate his eyes . 
`` Reflect , monseigneur , '' he said , `` upon everything we have to expect . 
As the matter now stands , the king is still alive , and his imprisonment saves your life . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Fouquet , `` you may have been acting on my behalf , but I will not , do not , accept your services . 
But , first of all , I do not wish your ruin . 
You will leave this house . '' 
Aramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart . 
`` I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof , '' continued Fouquet , with an air of inexpressible majesty ; `` you will not be more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated . '' 
`` You will be so , '' said Aramis , in a hoarse , prophetic voice , `` you will be so , believe me . '' 
`` I accept the augury , Monsieur d'Herblay ; but nothing shall prevent me , nothing shall stop me . 
You will leave Vaux - you must leave France ; I give you four hours to place yourself out of the king 's reach . '' 
`` Four hours ? '' 
said Aramis , scornfully and incredulously . 
`` Upon the word of Fouquet , no one shall follow you before the expiration of that time . 
You will therefore have four hours ' advance of those whom the king may wish to dispatch after you . '' 
Four hours ! '' 
repeated Aramis , in a thick , smothered voice . 
`` It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to Belle - Isle , which I give you as a place of refuge . '' 
`` Ah ! ''
