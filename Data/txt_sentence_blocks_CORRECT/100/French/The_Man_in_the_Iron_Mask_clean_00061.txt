`` I tell you he will do it . '' 
`` He may ; but I will go and help him . '' 
`` To be sure you will ; I reckoned upon you , and still further believe that when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Athos , shaking his head . 
`` Patience ! 
patience ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , permit us to take our leave . '' 
`` Begone , then , and may my good luck attend you . '' 
`` Adieu ! 
monseigneur ; and may your own good luck attend you likewise . '' 
`` Here is an expedition admirably commenced ! '' 
said Athos to his son . 
`` No provisions - no store flotilla ! 
What can be done , thus ? '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
murmured Raoul ; `` if all are going to do as I am , provisions will not be wanted . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Athos , sternly , `` do not be unjust and senseless in your egotism , or your grief , whichever you please to call it . 
If you set out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein , you stand in need of nobody , and it was scarcely worth while to recommend you to M. de Beaufort . 
But when you have been introduced to the prime commandant - when you have accepted the responsibility of a post in his army , the question is no longer about you , but about all those poor soldiers , who , as well as you , have hearts and bodies , who will weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their condition . 
Remember , Raoul , that officers are ministers as useful to the world as priests , and that they ought to have more charity . '' 
`` Monsieur , I know it and have practiced it ; I would have continued to do so still , but - '' `` You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military glory ; go and die if you like , but do not die without honor and without advantage to France . 
Cheer up , Raoul ! 
do not let my words grieve you ; I love you , and wish to see you perfect . '' 
`` I love your reproaches , monsieur , '' said the young man , mildly ; `` they alone may cure me , because they prove to me that some one loves me still . '' 
`` And now , Raoul , let us be off ; the weather is so fine , the heavens so clear , those heavens which we always find above our heads , which you will see more clear still at Gigelli , and which will speak to you of me there , as they speak to me here of God . '' 
The two gentlemen , after having agreed on this point , talked over the wild freaks of the duke , convinced that France would be served in a very incomplete manner , as regarded both spirit and practice , in the ensuing expedition ; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word vanity , they set forward , in obedience rather to their will than destiny . 
The sacrifice was half accomplished . 
: The Silver Dish . 
The journey passed off pretty well . 
Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon . 
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D'Artagnan . 
His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . 
Athos knew from experience that D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair , whether on his own account or on the service of the king . 
He even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . 
And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the flotilla , and got together the chalands and lighters to send them to Toulon , one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark . 
Athos , believing that this man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish , and so gain more money when all his companions were gone , insisted upon having the details . 
The fisherman informed him that six days previously , a man had come in the night to hire his boat , for the purpose of visiting the island of St. Honnorat . 
The price was agreed upon , but the gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case , which he insisted upon embarking , in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the operation . 
The fisherman wished to retract . 
He had even threatened , but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the gentleman 's cane , which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long . 
Swearing and grumbling , he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes , who administer justice among themselves and protect each other ; but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper , at sight of which the syndic , bowing to the very ground , enjoined obedience from the fisherman , and abused him for having been refractory . 
They then departed with the freight . 
`` But all this does not tell us , '' said Athos , `` how you injured your boat . '' 
`` This is the way . 
I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman desired me ; but he changed his mind , and pretended that I could not pass to the south of the abbey . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
`` Because , monsieur , there is in front of the square tower of the Benedictines , towards the southern point , the bank of the Moines . '' 
`` A rock ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` Level with the water , but below water ; a dangerous passage , yet one I have cleared a thousand times ; the gentleman required me to land him at Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur ! '' 
cried the fisherman , with his Provencal accent , `` a man is a sailor , or he is not ; he knows his course , or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber . 
I was obstinate , and wished to try the channel . 
The gentleman took me by the collar , and told me quietly he would strangle me . 
My mate armed himself with a hatchet , and so did I . 
We had the affront of the night before to pay him out for . 
But the gentleman drew his sword , and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner , that we neither of us could get near him . 
I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head , and I had a right to do so , had n't I , monsieur ? 
for a sailor aboard is master , as a citizen is in his chamber ; I was going , then , in self-defense , to cut the gentleman in two , when , all at once - believe me or not , monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself , I do n't know how , and there came out of it a sort of a phantom , his head covered with a black helmet and a black mask , something terrible to look upon , which came towards me threatening with its fist . '' 
`` And that was - '' said Athos . 
`` That was the devil , monsieur ; for the gentleman , with great glee , cried out , on seeing him : ` Ah ! 
thank you , monseigneur ! ' '' 
`` A most strange story ! '' 
murmured the comte , looking at Raoul . 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
asked the latter of the fisherman . 
`` You must know , monsieur , that two poor men , such as we are , could be no match for two gentlemen ; but when one of them turned out to be the devil , we had no earthly chance ! 
My companion and I did not stop to consult one another ; we made but one jump into the sea , for we were within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore . '' 
`` Well , and then ? '' 
`` Why , and then , monseigneur , as there was a little wind from the southwest , the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Oh ! 
- but the travelers ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
you need not be uneasy about them ! 
It was pretty plain that one was the devil , and protected the other ; for when we recovered the boat , after she got afloat again , instead of finding these two creatures injured by the shock , we found nothing , not even the carriage or the case . '' 
`` Very strange ! 
very strange ! '' 
repeated the comte . 
`` But after that , what did you do , my friend ? '' 
`` I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite 's , who brought my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would have me flogged . '' 
`` What ! 
did the governor himself say so ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; and yet my boat was injured , seriously injured , for the prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite 's , and the carpenter asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it . '' 
`` Very well , '' replied Raoul ; `` you will be exempted from the service . 
Go . '' 
`` We will go to Sainte-Marguerite 's , shall we ? '' 
said the comte to Bragelonne , as the man walked away . 
`` Yes , monsieur , for there is something to be cleared up ; that man does not seem to me to have told the truth . '' 
`` Nor to me either , Raoul . 
The story of the masked man and the carriage having disappeared , may be told to conceal some violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea , to punish him for his persistence in embarking . '' 
`` I formed the same suspicion ; the carriage was more likely to contain property than a man . '' 
`` We shall see to that , Raoul . 
The gentleman very much resembles D'Artagnan ; I recognize his methods of proceeding . 
Alas ! 
we are no longer the young invincibles of former days . 
Who knows whether the hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which the best blades of Europe , balls , and bullets have not been able to do in forty years ? ''
