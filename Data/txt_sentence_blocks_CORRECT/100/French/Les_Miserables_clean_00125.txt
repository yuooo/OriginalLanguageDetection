Forever ! '' 
that is to say : `` Enter . '' 
The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business . 
This parlor adjoined the chapter hall . 
The prioress , seated on the only chair in the parlor , was waiting for Fauchelevent . 
FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions , notably priests and nuns , to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions . 
At the moment when Fauchelevent entered , this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress , who was that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur , Mother Innocente , who was ordinarily cheerful . 
The gardener made a timid bow , and remained at the door of the cell . 
The prioress , who was telling her beads , raised her eyes and said : -- `` Ah ! 
it is you , Father Fauvent . '' 
This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent . 
Fauchelevent bowed again . 
`` Father Fauvent , I have sent for you . '' 
`` Here I am , reverend Mother . '' 
`` I have something to say to you . '' 
`` And so have I , '' said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror , `` I have something to say to the very reverend Mother . '' 
The prioress stared at him . 
`` Ah ! 
you have a communication to make to me . '' 
`` A request . '' 
`` Very well , speak . '' 
Goodman Fauchelevent , the ex-notary , belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance . 
A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force ; you do not distrust it , and you are caught by it . 
Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent . 
Always solitary and busied about his gardening , he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity . 
As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro , he saw before him only an agitation of shadows . 
By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh , and those corpses were alive for him . 
He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener , and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute . 
He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals , and he had succeeded , so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him ; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear . 
Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all ; that constituted his art . 
The whole convent thought him stupid . 
A great merit in religion . 
The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent . 
He was a curious mute . 
He inspired confidence . 
Moreover , he was regular , and never went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden . 
This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit . 
None the less , he had set two men to chattering : the porter , in the convent , and he knew the singularities of their parlor , and the grave-digger , at the cemetery , and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture ; in this way , he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns , one as to their life , the other as to their death . 
But he did not abuse his knowledge . 
The congregation thought a great deal of him . 
Old , lame , blind to everything , probably a little deaf into the bargain , -- what qualities ! 
They would have found it difficult to replace him . 
The goodman , with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated , entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress . 
He talked a long time about his age , his infirmities , the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth , of the increasing demands of his work , of the great size of the garden , of nights which must be passed , like the last , for instance , when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds , because of the moon , and he wound up as follows : `` That he had a brother '' -- -LRB- the prioress made a movement -RRB- , -- `` a brother no longer young '' -- -LRB- a second movement on the part of the prioress , but one expressive of reassurance -RRB- , -- `` that , if he might be permitted , this brother would come and live with him and help him , that he was an excellent gardener , that the community would receive from him good service , better than his own ; that , otherwise , if his brother were not admitted , as he , the elder , felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work , he should be obliged , greatly to his regret , to go away ; and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him , who might be reared for God in the house , and who might , who knows , become a nun some day . '' 
When he had finished speaking , the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers , and said to him : -- `` Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening ? '' 
`` For what purpose ? '' 
`` To serve as a lever . '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother , '' replied Fauchelevent . 
The prioress , without adding a word , rose and entered the adjoining room , which was the hall of the chapter , and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled . 
Fauchelevent was left alone . 
MOTHER INNOCENTE About a quarter of an hour elapsed . 
The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair . 
The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied . 
We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued , to the best of our ability . 
`` Father Fauvent ! '' 
`` Reverend Mother ! '' 
`` Do you know the chapel ? '' 
`` I have a little cage there , where I hear the mass and the offices . '' 
`` And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties ? '' 
`` Two or three times . '' 
`` There is a stone to be raised . '' 
`` Heavy ? '' 
`` The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar . '' 
`` The slab which closes the vault ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` It would be a good thing to have two men for it . '' 
`` Mother Ascension , who is as strong as a man , will help you . '' 
`` A woman is never a man . '' 
`` We have only a woman here to help you . 
Each one does what he can . 
Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard , while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven , I do not despise Merlonus Horstius . '' 
`` Neither do I. '' `` Merit consists in working according to one 's strength . 
A cloister is not a dock-yard . '' 
`` And a woman is not a man . 
But my brother is the strong one , though ! '' 
`` And can you get a lever ? '' 
`` That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door . '' 
`` There is a ring in the stone . '' 
`` I will put the lever through it . '' 
`` And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot . '' 
`` That is good , reverend Mother . 
I will open the vault . '' 
`` And the four Mother Precentors will help you . '' 
`` And when the vault is open ? '' 
`` It must be closed again . '' 
`` Will that be all ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Give me your orders , very reverend Mother . '' 
`` Fauvent , we have confidence in you . '' 
`` I am here to do anything you wish . '' 
`` And to hold your peace about everything ! '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` When the vault is open -- '' `` I will close it again . '' 
`` But before that -- '' `` What , reverend Mother ? '' 
`` Something must be lowered into it . '' 
A silence ensued . 
The prioress , after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation , broke it . 
`` Father Fauvent ! '' 
`` Reverend Mother ! '' 
`` You know that a mother died this morning ? ''
