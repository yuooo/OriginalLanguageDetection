`` And punish it with death , sire ? '' 
`` With death ; yes , monsieur , I have said it . '' 
`` Sire , '' said the surintendant , with firmness , as he raised his head proudly , `` your majesty will take the life , if you please , of your brother Philippe of France ; that concerns you alone , and you will doubtless consult the queen-mother upon the subject . 
Whatever she may command will be perfectly correct . 
I do not wish to mix myself up in it , not even for the honor of your crown , but I have a favor to ask of you , and I beg to submit it to you . '' 
`` Speak , '' said the king , in no little degree agitated by his minister 's last words . 
`` What do you require ? '' 
`` The pardon of M. d'Herblay and of M. du Vallon . '' 
`` My assassins ? '' 
`` Two rebels , sire , that is all . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I understand , then , you ask me to forgive your friends . '' 
`` My friends ! '' 
said Fouquet , deeply wounded . 
`` Your friends , certainly ; but the safety of the state requires that an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty . '' 
`` I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just restored you to liberty , and have saved your life . '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
`` I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d'Herblay wished to carry out his character of an assassin , he could very easily have assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart , and all would have been over . '' 
The king started . 
`` A pistol-bullet through the head , '' pursued Fouquet , `` and the disfigured features of Louis XIV. , which no one could have recognized , would be M. d'Herblay 's complete and entire justification . '' 
The king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had escaped . 
`` If M. d'Herblay , '' continued Fouquet , `` had been an assassin , he had no occasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed . 
Freed from the real king , it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the false . 
And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria , he would still have been - her son . 
The usurper , as far as Monsieur d'Herblay 's conscience was concerned , was still a king of the blood of Louis XIII . 
Moreover , the conspirator , in that course , would have had security , secrecy , impunity . 
A pistol-bullet would have procured him all that . 
For the sake of Heaven , sire , grant me his forgiveness . '' 
The king , instead of being touched by the picture , so faithfully drawn in all details , of Aramis 's generosity , felt himself most painfully and cruelly humiliated . 
His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a man had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal life . 
Every word that fell from Fouquet 's lips , and which he thought most efficacious in procuring his friend 's pardon , seemed to pour another drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV . 
Nothing could bend or soften him . 
Addressing himself to Fouquet , he said , `` I really do n't know , monsieur , why you should solicit the pardon of these men . 
What good is there in asking that which can be obtained without solicitation ? '' 
`` I do not understand you , sire . '' 
`` It is not difficult , either . 
Where am I now ? '' 
`` In the Bastile , sire . '' 
`` Yes ; in a dungeon . 
I am looked upon as a madman , am I not ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And no one is known here but Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Well ; change nothing in the position of affairs . 
Let the poor madman rot between the slimy walls of the Bastile , and M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness . 
Their new king will absolve them . '' 
`` Your majesty does me a great injustice , sire ; and you are wrong , '' replied Fouquet , dryly ; `` I am not child enough , nor is M. d'Herblay silly enough , to have omitted to make all these reflections ; and if I had wished to make a new king , as you say , I had no occasion to have come here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile , to free you from this place . 
That would show a want of even common sense . 
Your majesty 's mind is disturbed by anger ; otherwise you would be far from offending , groundlessly , the very one of your servants who has rendered you the most important service of all . '' 
Louis perceived that he had gone too far ; that the gates of the Bastile were still closed upon him , whilst , by degrees , the floodgates were gradually being opened , behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had restrained his anger . 
`` I did not say that to humiliate you , Heaven knows , monsieur , '' he replied . 
`` Only you are addressing yourself to me in order to obtain a pardon , and I answer according to my conscience . 
And so , judging by my conscience , the criminals we speak of are not worthy of consideration or forgiveness . '' 
Fouquet was silent . 
`` What I do is as generous , '' added the king , `` as what you have done , for I am in your power . 
I will even say it is more generous , inasmuch as you place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty , my life , may depend ; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both . '' 
`` I was wrong , certainly , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Yes , - I had the appearance of extorting a favor ; I regret it , and entreat your majesty 's forgiveness . '' 
`` And you are forgiven , my dear Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , with a smile , which restored the serene expression of his features , which so many circumstances had altered since the preceding evening . 
`` I have my own forgiveness , '' replied the minister , with some degree of persistence ; `` but M. d'Herblay , and M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` They will never obtain theirs , as long as I live , '' replied the inflexible king . 
`` Do me the kindness not to speak of it again . '' 
`` Your majesty shall be obeyed . '' 
`` And you will bear me no ill-will for it ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , sire ; for I anticipated the event . '' 
`` You had ` anticipated ' that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen ? '' 
`` Certainly ; and all my measures were taken in consequence . '' 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
cried the king , surprised . 
`` M. d'Herblay came , as may be said , to deliver himself into my hands . 
M. d'Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country . 
I could not condemn M. d'Herblay to death ; nor could I , on the other hand , expose him to your majesty 's justifiable wrath ; it would have been just the same as if I had killed him myself . '' 
`` Well ! 
and what have you done ? '' 
`` Sire , I gave M. d'Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours ' start over all those your majesty might , probably , dispatch after him . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` But still , the world is wide enough and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses , notwithstanding the ` four hours ' start ' which you have given to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` In giving him these four hours , sire , I knew I was giving him his life , and he will save his life . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
`` After having galloped as hard as possible , with the four hours ' start , before your musketeers , he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle , where I have given him a safe asylum . '' 
`` That may be ! 
But you forget that you have made me a present of Belle - Isle . '' 
`` But not for you to arrest my friends . '' 
`` You take it back again , then ? '' 
`` As far as that goes - yes , sire . '' 
`` My musketeers shall capture it , and the affair will be at an end . '' 
`` Neither your musketeers , nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle , '' said Fouquet , coldly . 
`` Belle-Isle is impregnable . '' 
The king became perfectly livid ; a lightning flash seemed to dart from his eyes . 
Fouquet felt that he was lost , but he as not one to shrink when the voice of honor spoke loudly within him . 
He bore the king 's wrathful gaze ; the latter swallowed his rage , and after a few moments ' silence , said , `` Are we going to return to Vaux ? '' 
`` I am at your majesty 's orders , '' replied Fouquet , with a low bow ; `` but I think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes previous to appearing before your court . '' 
`` We shall pass by the Louvre , '' said the king . 
`` Come . '' 
And they left the prison , passing before Baisemeaux , who looked completely bewildered as he saw Marchiali once more leave ; and , in his helplessness , tore out the major portion of his few remaining hairs . 
It was perfectly true , however , that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner 's release , and that the king wrote beneath it , `` Seen and approved , Louis '' ; a piece of madness that Baisemeaux , incapable of putting two ideas together , acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead with his own fist . 
: The False King . 
In the meantime , usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at Vaux .
