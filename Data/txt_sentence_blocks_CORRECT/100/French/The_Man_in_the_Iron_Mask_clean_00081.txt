There were not more than twenty paces between the two . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` I will not assassinate you ; if you will not fire upon me , surrender ! 
what is a prison ? '' 
`` I would rather die ! '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` I shall suffer less . '' 
D'Artagnan , drunk with despair , hurled his pistol to the ground . 
`` I will take you alive ! '' 
said he ; and by a prodigy of skill which this incomparable horseman alone was capable , he threw his horse forward to within ten paces of the white horse ; already his hand was stretched out to seize his prey . 
`` Kill me ! 
kill me ! '' 
cried Fouquet , '' ` twould be more humane ! '' 
`` No ! 
alive - alive ! '' 
murmured the captain . 
At this moment his horse made a false step for the second time , and Fouquet 's again took the lead . 
It was an unheard-of spectacle , this race between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their riders . 
It might be said that D'Artagnan rode , carrying his horse along between his knees . 
To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot , and that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all . 
But the chase appeared equally warm in the two fatigued athletoe . 
D'Artagnan , quite in despair , seized his second pistol , and cocked it . 
`` At your horse ! 
not at you ! '' 
cried he to Fouquet . 
And he fired . 
The animal was hit in the quarters - he made a furious bound , and plunged forward . 
At that moment D'Artagnan 's horse fell dead . 
`` I am dishonored ! '' 
thought the musketeer ; `` I am a miserable wretch ! 
for pity 's sake , M. Fouquet , throw me one of your pistols , that I may blow out my brains ! '' 
But Fouquet rode away . 
`` For mercy 's sake ! 
for mercy 's sake ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` that which you will not do at this moment , I myself will do within an hour , but here , upon this road , I should die bravely ; I should die esteemed ; do me that service , M. Fouquet ! '' 
M. Fouquet made no reply , but continued to trot on . 
D'Artagnan began to run after his enemy . 
Successively he threw away his hat , his coat , which embarrassed him , and then the sheath of his sword , which got between his legs as he was running . 
The sword in his hand itself became too heavy , and he threw it after the sheath . 
The white horse began to rattle in its throat ; D'Artagnan gained upon him . 
From a trot the exhausted animal sunk to a staggering walk - the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood . 
D'Artagnan made a desperate effort , sprang towards Fouquet , and seized him by the leg , saying in a broken , breathless voice , `` I arrest you in the king 's name ! 
blow my brains out , if you like ; we have both done our duty . '' 
Fouquet hurled far from him , into the river , the two pistols D'Artagnan might have seized , and dismounting from his horse - `` I am your prisoner , monsieur , '' said he ; `` will you take my arm , for I see you are ready to faint ? '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan , who , in fact , felt the earth sliding from under his feet , and the light of day turning to blackness around him ; then he rolled upon the sand , without breath or strength . 
Fouquet hastened to the brink of the river , dipped some water in his hat , with which he bathed the temples of the musketeer , and introduced a few drop between his lips . 
D'Artagnan raised himself with difficulty , and looked about him with a wandering eye . 
He beheld Fouquet on his knees , with his wet hat in his hand , smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness . 
`` You are not off , then ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
the true king of royalty , in heart , in soul , is not Louis of the Louvre , or Philippe of Sainte - Marguerite ; it is you , proscribed , condemned ! '' 
`` I , who this day am ruined by a single error , M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` What , in the name of Heaven , is that ? '' 
`` I should have had you for a friend ! 
But how shall we return to Nantes ? 
We are a great way from it . '' 
`` That is true , '' said D'Artagnan , gloomily . 
`` The white horse will recover , perhaps ; he is a good horse ! 
Mount , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; I will walk till you have rested a little . '' 
`` Poor beast ! 
and wounded , too ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` He will go , I tell you ; I know him ; but we can do better still , let us both get up , and ride slowly . '' 
`` We can try , '' said the captain . 
But they had scarcely charged the animal with this double load , when he began to stagger , and then with a great effort walked a few minutes , then staggered again , and sank down dead by the side of the black horse , which he had just managed to come up to . 
`` We will go on foot - destiny wills it so - the walk will be pleasant , '' said Fouquet , passing his arm through that of D'Artagnan . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
cried the latter , with a fixed eye , a contracted brow , and a swelling heart - `` What a disgraceful day ! '' 
They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting . 
When Fouquet perceived that sinister machine , he said to D'Artagnan , who cast down his eyes , ashamed of Louis XIV. , `` There is an idea that did not emanate from a brave man , Captain d'Artagnan ; it is not yours . 
What are these gratings for ? '' 
said he . 
`` To prevent your throwing letters out . '' 
`` Ingenious ! '' 
`` But you can speak , if you can not write , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Can I speak to you ? '' 
`` Why , certainly , if you wish to do so . '' 
Fouquet reflected for a moment , then looking the captain full in the face , `` One single word , '' said he ; `` will you remember it ? '' 
`` I will not forget it . '' 
`` Will you speak it to whom I wish ? '' 
`` I will . '' 
`` Saint-Mande , '' articulated Fouquet , in a low voice . 
`` Well ! 
and for whom ? '' 
`` For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson . '' 
`` It shall be done . '' 
The carriage rolled through Nantes , and took the route to Angers . 
: In Which the Squirrel Falls , - the Adder Flies . 
It was two o'clock in the afternoon . 
The king , full of impatience , went to his cabinet on the terrace , and kept opening the door of the corridor , to see what his secretaries were doing . 
M. Colbert , seated in the same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning , was chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne . 
The king opened the door suddenly , and addressed them . 
`` What is it you are saying ? '' 
`` We were speaking of the first sitting of the States , '' said M. de Brienne , rising . 
`` Very well , '' replied the king , and returned to his room . 
Five minutes after , the summons of the bell recalled Rose , whose hour it was . 
`` Have you finished your copies ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Not yet , sire . ''
