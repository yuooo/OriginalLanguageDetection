`` Yes , it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere , was it not ? '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` You are walking so heavily you will make the flooring give way . '' 
`` True , '' said the musketeer ; `` this room is above the dome , I think . '' 
`` And I did not choose it for a fencing-room , I assure you , '' added the bishop . 
`` The ceiling of the king 's room has all the lightness and calm of wholesome sleep . 
Do not forget , therefore , that my flooring is merely the covering of his ceiling . 
Good night , my friends , and in ten minutes I shall be asleep myself . '' 
And Aramis accompanied them to the door , laughing quietly all the while . 
As soon as they were outside , he bolted the door , hurriedly ; closed up the chinks of the windows , and then called out , `` Monseigneur ! 
- monseigneur ! '' 
Philippe made his appearance from the alcove , as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the bed . 
`` M. d'Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions , it seems , '' he said . 
`` Ah ! 
- you recognized M. d'Artagnan , then ? '' 
`` Before you called him by his name , even . '' 
`` He is your captain of musketeers . '' 
`` He is very devoted to me , '' replied Philippe , laying a stress upon the personal pronoun . 
`` As faithful as a dog ; but he bites sometimes . 
If D'Artagnan does not recognize you before the other has disappeared , rely upon D'Artagnan to the end of the world ; for in that case , if he has seen nothing , he will keep his fidelity . 
If he sees , when it is too late , he is a Gascon , and will never admit that he has been deceived . '' 
`` I thought so . 
What are we to do , now ? '' 
`` Sit in this folding-chair . 
I am going to push aside a portion of the flooring ; you will look through the opening , which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king 's apartment . 
Can you see ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Philippe , starting as at the sight of an enemy ; `` I see the king ! '' 
`` What is he doing ? '' 
`` He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him . '' 
`` M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` No , no ; wait a moment - '' `` Look at the notes and the portraits , my prince . '' 
`` The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert . '' 
`` Colbert sit down in the king 's presence ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis . 
`` It is impossible . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring . 
`` Yes , '' he said . 
`` Colbert himself . 
Oh , monseigneur ! 
what can we be going to hear - and what can result from this intimacy ? '' 
`` Nothing good for M. Fouquet , at all events . '' 
The prince did not deceive himself . 
We have seen that Louis XIV . 
had sent for Colbert , and Colbert had arrived . 
The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done ; it was true the king was alone with his subject . 
`` Colbert , '' said he , `` sit down . '' 
The intendant , overcome with delight , for he feared he was about to be dismissed , refused this unprecedented honor . 
`` Does he accept ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` No , he remains standing . '' 
`` Let us listen , then . '' 
And the future king and the future pope listened eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet , ready to crush them when they liked . 
`` Colbert , '' said the king , `` you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day . '' 
`` I know it , sire . '' 
`` Very good ; I like that answer . 
Yes , you knew it , and there was courage in the doing of it . '' 
`` I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty , but I risked , also , the concealment of your best interests . '' 
`` What ! 
you were afraid of something on my account ? '' 
`` I was , sire , even if it were nothing more than an indigestion , '' said Colbert ; `` for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one of to-day , unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living . '' 
Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon the king ; and Louis XIV. , who was the vainest and the most fastidiously delicate man in his kingdom , forgave Colbert the joke . 
`` The truth is , '' he said , `` that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal . 
Tell me , Colbert , where does he get all the money required for this enormous expenditure , - can you tell ? '' 
`` Yes , I do know , sire . '' 
`` Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty ? '' 
`` Easily ; and to the utmost farthing . '' 
`` I know you are very exact . '' 
`` Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of finances . '' 
`` But all are not so . '' 
`` I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , therefore , is rich - very rich , and I suppose every man knows he is so . '' 
`` Every one , sire ; the living as well as the dead . '' 
`` What does that mean , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
`` The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet 's wealth , - they admire and applaud the result produced ; but the dead , wiser and better informed than we are , know how that wealth was obtained - and they rise up in accusation . '' 
`` So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other . '' 
`` The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it . '' 
`` You have something to say to me more confidentially , I perceive ; do not be afraid , we are quite alone . '' 
`` I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience , and under the protection of your majesty , '' said Colbert , bowing . 
`` If the dead , therefore , were to speak - '' `` They do speak sometimes , sire , - read . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
murmured Aramis , in the prince 's ear , who , close beside him , listened without losing a syllable , `` since you are placed here , monseigneur , in order to learn your vocation of a king , listen to a piece of infamy - of a nature truly royal . 
You are about to be a witness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes . 
Listen attentively , - you will find your advantage in it . '' 
The prince redoubled his attention , and saw Louis XIV . 
take from Colbert 's hands a letter the latter held out to him . 
`` The late cardinal 's handwriting , '' said the king . 
`` Your majesty has an excellent memory , '' replied Colbert , bowing ; `` it is an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize handwritings at the first glance . '' 
The king read Mazarin 's letter , and , as its contents are already known to the reader , in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and Aramis , nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again . 
`` I do not quite understand , '' said the king , greatly interested . 
`` Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the public accounts . '' 
`` I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Thirteen millions . 
A tolerably good sum . '' 
`` Yes . 
Well , these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of the account . 
That is what I do not very well understand . 
How was this deficit possible ? '' 
`` Possible I do not say ; but there is no doubt about fact that it is really so . ''
