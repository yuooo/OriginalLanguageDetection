And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner . 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming , and addressing Moliere , said to him , in an undertone , `` You see before you , my dear monsieur , a man who considers himself disgraced , if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him ; study this type for me , Master Aristophanes , and profit by it . '' 
Moliere had no need of encouragement , and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` if you will come with me , I will make them take your measure without touching you . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos , `` how do you make that out , my friend ? '' 
`` I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your dress . 
It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of quality , who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them . 
We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these - '' `` Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin . 
Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , laughing , `` and do we write no more poems now , either ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
D'Artagnan , '' exclaimed Aramis , `` I have long ago given up all such tomfoolery . '' 
`` True , '' repeated D'Artagnan , only half convinced . 
As for Percerin , he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades . 
`` Do n't you perceive , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` that we are greatly boring this good gentleman , my dear D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
murmured the musketeer , aside ; `` that is , I am boring you , my friend . '' 
Then aloud , `` Well , then , let us leave ; I have no further business here , and if you are as disengaged as I , Aramis - '' `` No , not I - I wished - '' `` Ah ! 
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , - `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before . 
Percerin never moved . 
Aramis roused him violently , by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was engaged . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said he , `` I have , near hand , M. Lebrun , one of M. Fouquet 's painters . '' 
`` Ah , very good , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` but why Lebrun ? '' 
Aramis looked at D'Artagnan , who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark Antony . 
`` And you wish that I should make him a dress , similar to those of the Epicureans ? '' 
answered Percerin . 
And while saying this , in an absent manner , the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade . 
`` An Epicurean 's dress ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , in a tone of inquiry . 
`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . '' 
`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how - do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! '' 
`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the attentive musketeer ; perceiving with his wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now , and that the hour of battle was approaching . 
`` Let us see , '' said Percerin , incredulously . 
`` Why , now , '' continued Aramis , `` does M. Fouquet give the king a fete ? 
- Is it not to please him ? '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said Percerin . 
D'Artagnan nodded assent . 
`` By delicate attentions ? 
by some happy device ? 
by a succession of surprises , like that of which we were talking ? 
- the enrolment of our Epicureans . ''
