`` Yes ; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days . '' 
`` Why , what are you saying ? 
Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour , but they must try to put obstacles in his way ! 
I blush for them ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery . 
They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets ! '' 
`` That 's just what we count on doing . '' 
`` It 's a conspiracy , then , '' cried Passepartout , who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head , for he drank without perceiving it . 
`` A real conspiracy ! 
And gentlemen , too . 
Bah ! '' 
Fix began to be puzzled . 
`` Members of the Reform Club ! '' 
continued Passepartout . 
`` You must know , Monsieur Fix , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! '' 
`` But who do you think I am ? '' 
asked Fix , looking at him intently . 
`` Parbleu ! 
An agent of the members of the Reform Club , sent out here to interrupt my master 's journey . 
But , though I found you out some time ago , I 've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg . '' 
`` He knows nothing , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Passepartout , again emptying his glass . 
The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again . 
What should he do ? 
Passepartout 's mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult . 
It was evident that the servant was not the master 's accomplice , as Fix had been inclined to suspect . 
`` Well , '' said the detective to himself , `` as he is not an accomplice , he will help me . '' 
He had no time to lose : Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it . 
`` Listen to me , '' said Fix abruptly . 
`` I am not , as you think , an agent of the members of the Reform Club -- '' `` Bah ! '' 
retorted Passepartout , with an air of raillery . 
`` I am a police detective , sent out here by the London office . '' 
`` You , a detective ? '' 
`` I will prove it . 
Here is my commission . '' 
Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document , the genuineness of which could not be doubted . 
`` Mr. Fogg 's wager , '' resumed Fix , `` is only a pretext , of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes . 
He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
`` Listen . 
On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured . 
Here is his description ; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
cried Passepartout , striking the table with his fist . 
`` My master is the most honourable of men ! '' 
`` How can you tell ? 
You know scarcely anything about him . 
You went into his service the day he came away ; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes . 
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' repeated the poor fellow , mechanically . 
`` Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice ? '' 
Passepartout , overcome by what he had heard , held his head between his hands , and did not dare to look at the detective . 
Phileas Fogg , the saviour of Aouda , that brave and generous man , a robber ! 
And yet how many presumptions there were against him ! 
Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind ; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty . 
`` Well , what do you want of me ? '' 
said he , at last , with an effort . 
`` See here , '' replied Fix ; `` I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place , but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London . 
You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong -- '' `` I ! 
But I -- '' `` I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
replied Passepartout , who tried to rise , but fell back , exhausted in mind and body . 
`` Mr. Fix , '' he stammered , `` even should what you say be true -- if my master is really the robber you are seeking for -- which I deny -- I have been , am , in his service ; I have seen his generosity and goodness ; and I will never betray him -- not for all the gold in the world . 
I come from a village where they do n't eat that kind of bread ! '' 
`` You refuse ? '' 
`` I refuse . '' 
`` Consider that I 've said nothing , '' said Fix ; `` and let us drink . '' 
`` Yes ; let us drink ! '' 
Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor . 
Fix , seeing that he must , at all hazards , be separated from his master , wished to entirely overcome him . 
Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table . 
Fix slipped one into Passepartout 's hand . 
He took it , put it between his lips , lit it , drew several puffs , and his head , becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic , fell upon the table . 
`` At last ! '' 
said Fix , seeing Passepartout unconscious . 
`` Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatic 's departure ; and , if he is , he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman ! '' 
And , after paying his bill , Fix left the tavern . 
IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG While these events were passing at the opium-house , Mr. Fogg , unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer , was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter , making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them . 
It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag ; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions . 
He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity : `` It is in the interest of my journey -- a part of my programme . '' 
The purchases made , they returned to the hotel , where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote ; after which Aouda , shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion , retired to her room for rest . 
Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News . 
Had he been capable of being astonished at anything , it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime . 
But , knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning , he did not disturb himself about the matter . 
When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master 's bell , Mr. Fogg , not betraying the least vexation , contented himself with taking his carpet-bag , calling Aouda , and sending for a palanquin . 
It was then eight o'clock ; at half-past nine , it being then high tide , the Carnatic would leave the harbour . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin , their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow , and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark . 
Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before . 
He had expected to find not only the steamer , but his domestic , and was forced to give up both ; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face , and he merely remarked to Aouda , `` It is an accident , madam ; nothing more . '' 
At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached . 
It was Fix , who , bowing , addressed Mr. Fogg : `` Were you not , like me , sir , a passenger by the Rangoon , which arrived yesterday ? '' 
`` I was , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg coldly . 
`` But I have not the honour -- '' `` Pardon me ; I thought I should find your servant here . '' 
`` Do you know where he is , sir ? '' 
asked Aouda anxiously . 
`` What ! '' 
responded Fix , feigning surprise . 
`` Is he not with you ? '' 
`` No , '' said Aouda .
