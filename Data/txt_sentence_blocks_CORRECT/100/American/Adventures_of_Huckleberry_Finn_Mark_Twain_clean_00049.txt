He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do . 
So Tom says : `` What 's the vittles for ? 
Going to feed the dogs ? '' 
The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : `` Yes , Mars Sid , A dog . 
Cur ` us dog , too . 
Does you want to go en look at ` im ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
I hunched Tom , and whispers : `` You going , right here in the daybreak ? 
THAT war n't the plan . '' 
`` No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan NOW . '' 
So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much . 
When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : `` Why , HUCK ! 
En good LAN ' ! 
ain ' dat Misto Tom ? '' 
I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it . 
I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : `` Why , de gracious sakes ! 
do he know you genlmen ? '' 
We could see pretty well now . 
Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : `` Does WHO know us ? '' 
`` Why , dis-yer runaway nigger . '' 
`` I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ? '' 
`` What PUT it dar ? 
Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ? '' 
Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : `` Well , that 's mighty curious . 
WHO sung out ? 
WHEN did he sing out ? 
WHAT did he sing out ? '' 
And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , `` Did YOU hear anybody sing out ? '' 
Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : `` No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing . '' 
Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : `` Did you sing out ? '' 
`` No , sah , '' says Jim ; `` I hai n't said nothing , sah . '' 
`` Not a word ? '' 
`` No , sah , I hai n't said a word . '' 
`` Did you ever see us before ? '' 
`` No , sah ; not as I knows on . '' 
So Tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : `` What do you reckon 's the matter with you , anyway ? 
What made you think somebody sung out ? '' 
`` Oh , it 's de dad-blame ' witches , sah , en I wisht I was dead , I do . 
Dey 's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos ' kill me , dey sk ` yers me so . 
Please to do n't tell nobody ` bout it sah , er ole Mars Silas he 'll scole me ; ` kase he say dey AI N'T no witches . 
I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say ! 
I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it DIS time . 
But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's SOT , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth 'n' en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when YOU fine it out en tell um ` bout it , dey doan ' b ` lieve you . '' 
Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : `` I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger . 
If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him . '' 
And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : `` Do n't ever let on to know us . 
And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free . '' 
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then . 
IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place . 
We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : `` Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be . 
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan . 
There ai n't no watchman to be drugged -- now there OUGHT to be a watchman . 
There ai n't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to . 
And there 's Jim chained by one leg , with a ten-foot chain , to the leg of his bed : why , all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain . 
And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody ; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger , and do n't send nobody to watch the nigger . 
Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this , only there would n't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg . 
Why , drat it , Huck , it 's the stupidest arrangement I ever see . 
You got to invent ALL the difficulties . 
Well , we ca n't help it ; we got to do the best we can with the materials we 've got . 
Anyhow , there 's one thing -- there 's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers , where there war n't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them , and you had to contrive them all out of your own head . 
Now look at just that one thing of the lantern . 
When you come down to the cold facts , we simply got to LET ON that a lantern 's resky . 
Why , we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to , I believe . 
Now , whilst I think of it , we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get . '' 
`` What do we want of a saw ? '' 
`` What do we WANT of a saw ? 
Hai n't we got to saw the leg of Jim 's bed off , so as to get the chain loose ? '' 
`` Why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off . '' 
`` Well , if that ai n't just like you , Huck Finn . 
You CAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing . 
Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ? 
-- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes ? 
Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ? 
No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound . 
Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are . 
Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there 's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is . 
It 's gaudy , Huck . 
I wish there was a moat to this cabin . 
If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one . '' 
I says : `` What do we want of a moat when we 're going to snake him out from under the cabin ? '' 
But he never heard me . 
He had forgot me and everything else . 
He had his chin in his hand , thinking . 
Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : `` No , it would n't do -- there ai n't necessity enough for it . '' 
`` For what ? '' 
I says . 
`` Why , to saw Jim 's leg off , '' he says . 
`` Good land ! '' 
I says ; `` why , there ai n't NO necessity for it . 
And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway ? '' 
`` Well , some of the best authorities has done it . 
They could n't get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved . 
And a leg would be better still . 
But we got to let that go . 
There ai n't necessity enough in this case ; and , besides , Jim 's a nigger , and would n't understand the reasons for it , and how it 's the custom in Europe ; so we 'll let it go . 
But there 's one thing -- he can have a rope ladder ; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough . 
And we can send it to him in a pie ; it 's mostly done that way . 
And I 've et worse pies . '' 
`` Why , Tom Sawyer , how you talk , '' I says ; `` Jim ai n't got no use for a rope ladder . '' 
`` He HAS got use for it .
