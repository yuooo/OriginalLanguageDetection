But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . 
If money 's to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here ! '' 
`` He smites his chest , '' whispered Stubb , `` what 's that for ? 
methinks it rings most vast , but hollow . '' 
`` Vengeance on a dumb brute ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` that simply smote thee from blindest instinct ! 
Madness ! 
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous . '' 
`` Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer . 
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks . 
But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask . 
If man will strike , strike through the mask ! 
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? 
To me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me . 
Sometimes I think there 's naught beyond . 
But 't is enough . 
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it . 
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him . 
Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I 'd strike the sun if it insulted me . 
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations . 
But not my master , man , is even that fair play . 
Who 's over me ? 
Truth hath no confines . 
Take off thine eye ! 
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare ! 
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow . 
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself . 
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity . 
I meant not to incense thee . 
Let it go . 
Look ! 
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . 
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! 
The crew , man , the crew ! 
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ? 
See Stubb ! 
he laughs ! 
See yonder Chilian ! 
he snorts to think of it . 
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling can not , Starbuck ! 
And what is it ? 
Reckon it . 
'T is but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck . 
What is it more ? 
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone . 
Ah ! 
constrainings seize thee ; I see ! 
the billow lifts thee ! 
Speak , but speak ! 
-- Aye , aye ! 
thy silence , then , that voices thee . 
-LRB- Aside -RRB- Something shot from my dilated nostrils , he has inhaled it in his lungs . 
Starbuck now is mine ; can not oppose me now , without rebellion . '' 
`` God keep me ! 
-- keep us all ! '' 
murmured Starbuck , lowly . 
But in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in . 
For again Starbuck 's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before . 
Ah , ye admonitions and warnings ! 
why stay ye not when ye come ? 
But rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows ! 
Yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the fore-going things within . 
For with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on . 
`` The measure ! 
the measure ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . 
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship 's company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . 
But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian . 
`` Drink and pass ! '' 
he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . 
`` The crew alone now drink . 
Round with it , round ! 
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; 't is hot as Satan 's hoof . 
So , so ; it goes round excellently . 
It spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye . 
Well done ; almost drained . 
That way it went , this way it comes . 
Hand it me -- here 's a hollow ! 
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . 
Steward , refill ! 
`` Attend now , my braves . 
I have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . 
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha ! 
boy , come back ? 
bad pennies come not sooner . 
Hand it me . 
Why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , wert not thou St. Vitus ' imp -- away , thou ague ! 
`` Advance , ye mates ! 
Cross your lances full before me . 
Well done ! 
Let me touch the axis . '' 
So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask . 
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life . 
The three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect . 
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright . 
`` In vain ! '' 
cried Ahab ; `` but , maybe , 't is well . 
For did ye three but once take the full-forced shock , then mine own electric thing , that had perhaps expired from out me .
