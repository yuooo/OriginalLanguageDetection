`` Now , cook , '' said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; Stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention . '' 
`` All ` dention , '' said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position . 
`` Well , '' said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; `` I shall now go back to the subject of this steak . 
In the first place , how old are you , cook ? '' 
`` What dat do wid de ` teak , '' said the old black , testily . 
`` Silence ! 
How old are you , cook ? '' '' 
` Bout ninety , dey say , '' he gloomily muttered . 
And have you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and do n't know yet how to cook a whale-steak ? '' 
rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the question . 
`` Where were you born , cook ? '' '' 
` Hind de hatchway , in ferry-boat , goin ' ober de Roanoke . '' 
`` Born in a ferry-boat ! 
That 's queer , too . 
But I want to know what country you were born in , cook ! '' 
`` Did n't I say de Roanoke country ? '' 
he cried sharply . 
`` No , you did n't , cook ; but I 'll tell you what I 'm coming to , cook . 
You must go home and be born over again ; you do n't know how to cook a whale-steak yet . '' 
`` Bress my soul , if I cook noder one , '' he growled , angrily , turning round to depart . 
`` Come back here , cook ; -- here , hand me those tongs ; -- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? 
Take it , I say '' -- holding the tongs towards him -- `` take it , and taste it . '' 
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , `` Best cooked ` teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy . '' 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; `` do you belong to the church ? '' 
`` Passed one once in Cape-Down , '' said the old man sullenly . 
`` And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures , have you , cook ! 
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Where do you expect to go to , cook ? '' 
`` Go to bed berry soon , '' he mumbled , half-turning as he spoke . 
`` Avast ! 
heave to ! 
I mean when you die , cook . 
It 's an awful question . 
Now what 's your answer ? '' 
`` When dis old brack man dies , '' said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , `` he hisself wo n't go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him . '' 
`` Fetch him ? 
How ? 
In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ? 
And fetch him where ? '' 
`` Up dere , '' said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly . 
`` So , then , you expect to go up into our main-top , do you , cook , when you are dead ? 
But do n't you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ? 
Main-top , eh ? '' 
`` Did n't say dat t ` all , '' said Fleece , again in the sulks . 
`` You said up there , did n't you ? 
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . 
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber 's hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you do n't get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging . 
It 's a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it 's no go . 
But none of us are in heaven yet . 
Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders . 
Do ye hear ? 
Hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ` other a ` top of your heart , when I 'm giving my orders , cook . 
What ! 
that your heart , there ? 
-- that 's your gizzard ! 
Aloft ! 
aloft ! 
-- that 's it -- now you have it . 
Hold it there now , and pay attention . '' 
`` All ` dention , '' said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time . 
`` Well then , cook , you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , do n't you ? 
Well , for the future , when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here , the capstan , I 'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing . 
Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d'ye hear ? 
And now to-morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle . 
As for the ends of the flukes , have them soused , cook . 
There , now ye may go . '' 
But Fleece had hardly got three paces off , when he was recalled . 
`` Cook , give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch . 
D'ye hear ? 
away you sail then . 
-- Halloa ! 
stop ! 
make a bow before you go . 
-- Avast heaving again ! 
Whale-balls for breakfast -- do n't forget . '' 
`` Wish , by gor ! 
whale eat him , ` stead of him eat whale . 
I 'm bressed if he ai n't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself , '' muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock . 
The Whale as a Dish That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like Stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it . 
It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there . 
Also , that in Henry VIIIth 's time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . 
Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . 
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls . 
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them . 
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown . 
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite . 
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious . 
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil . 
Zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing . 
And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . 
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called `` fritters '' ; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough-nuts or oly-cooks , when fresh . 
They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off . 
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . 
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good . 
Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo 's -LRB- which is esteemed a rare dish -RRB- , were it not such a solid pyramid of fat . 
But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter . 
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it . 
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile . 
Many a good supper have I thus made .
