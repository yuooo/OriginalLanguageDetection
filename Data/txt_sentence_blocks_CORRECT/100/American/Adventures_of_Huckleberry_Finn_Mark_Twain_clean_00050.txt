How YOU talk , you better say ; you do n't know nothing about it . 
He 's GOT to have a rope ladder ; they all do . '' 
`` What in the nation can he DO with it ? '' 
`` DO with it ? 
He can hide it in his bed , ca n't he ? '' 
That 's what they all do ; and HE 'S got to , too . 
Huck , you do n't ever seem to want to do anything that 's regular ; you want to be starting something fresh all the time . 
S'pose he DO N'T do nothing with it ? 
ai n't it there in his bed , for a clew , after he 's gone ? 
and do n't you reckon they 'll want clews ? 
Of course they will . 
And you would n't leave them any ? 
That would be a PRETTY howdy-do , WOULD N'T it ! 
I never heard of such a thing . '' 
`` Well , '' I says , `` if it 's in the regulations , and he 's got to have it , all right , let him have it ; because I do n't wish to go back on no regulations ; but there 's one thing , Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder , we 're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally , just as sure as you 're born . 
Now , the way I look at it , a hickry-bark ladder do n't cost nothing , and do n't waste nothing , and is just as good to load up a pie with , and hide in a straw tick , as any rag ladder you can start ; and as for Jim , he ai n't had no experience , and so he do n't care what kind of a -- '' `` Oh , shucks , Huck Finn , if I was as ignorant as you I 'd keep still -- that 's what I 'D do . 
Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder ? 
Why , it 's perfectly ridiculous . '' 
`` Well , all right , Tom , fix it your own way ; but if you 'll take my advice , you 'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline . '' 
He said that would do . 
And that gave him another idea , and he says : `` Borrow a shirt , too . '' 
`` What do we want of a shirt , Tom ? '' 
`` Want it for Jim to keep a journal on . '' 
`` Journal your granny -- JIM ca n't write . '' 
`` S'pose he CA N'T write -- he can make marks on the shirt , ca n't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop ? '' 
`` Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too . '' 
`` PRISONERS do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins . 
They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall . 
THEY would n't use a goose-quill if they had it . 
It ai n't regular . '' 
`` Well , then , what 'll we make him the ink out of ? '' 
`` Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears ; but that 's the common sort and women ; the best authorities uses their own blood . 
Jim can do that ; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he 's captivated , he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window . 
The Iron Mask always done that , and it 's a blame ' good way , too . '' 
`` Jim ai n't got no tin plates . 
They feed him in a pan . '' 
`` That ai n't nothing ; we can get him some . '' 
`` Ca n't nobody READ his plates . '' 
`` That ai n't got anything to DO with it , Huck Finn . 
All HE 'S got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out . 
You do n't HAVE to be able to read it . 
Why , half the time you ca n't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else . '' 
`` Well , then , what 's the sense in wasting the plates ? '' 
`` Why , blame it all , it ai n't the PRISONER 'S plates . '' 
`` But it 's SOMEBODY 'S plates , ai n't it ? '' 
`` Well , spos 'n it is ? 
What does the PRISONER care whose -- '' He broke off there , because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing . 
So we cleared out for the house . 
Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line ; and I found an old sack and put them in it , and we went down and got the fox-fire , and put that in too . 
I called it borrowing , because that was what pap always called it ; but Tom said it war n't borrowing , it was stealing . 
He said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners do n't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody do n't blame them for it , either . 
It ai n't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , Tom said ; it 's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with . 
He said if we war n't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he war n't a prisoner . 
So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy . 
And yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for . 
Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we NEEDED . 
Well , I says , I needed the watermelon . 
But he said I did n't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was . 
He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right . 
So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon . 
Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch . 
By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk . 
He says : `` Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . '' 
`` Tools ? '' 
I says . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Tools for what ? '' 
`` Why , to dig with . 
We ai n't a-going to GNAW him out , are we ? '' 
`` Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ? '' 
I says . 
He turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : `` Huck Finn , did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ? 
Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero ? 
Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it . 
Picks and shovels -- why , they would n't furnish 'em to a king . '' 
`` Well , then , '' I says , `` if we do n't want the picks and shovels , what do we want ? '' 
`` A couple of case-knives . '' 
`` To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Confound it , it 's foolish , Tom . '' 
`` It do n't make no difference how foolish it is , it 's the RIGHT way -- and it 's the regular way . 
And there ai n't no OTHER way , that ever I heard of , and I 've read all the books that gives any information about these things . 
They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt , mind you ; generly it 's through solid rock . 
And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever . 
Why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef , in the harbor of Marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was HE at it , you reckon ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , guess . '' 
`` I do n't know . 
A month and a half . '' 
`` THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR -- and he come out in China . 
THAT 'S the kind . 
I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock . '' 
`` JIM do n't know nobody in China . '' 
`` What 's THAT got to do with it ? 
Neither did that other fellow . 
But you 're always a-wandering off on a side issue . 
Why ca n't you stick to the main point ? '' 
`` All right -- I do n't care where he comes out , so he COMES out ; and Jim do n't , either , I reckon . 
But there 's one thing , anyway -- Jim 's too old to be dug out with a case-knife . 
He wo n't last . ''
