His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling . 
When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him . 
`` Pleasant day , '' said the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror . 
`` Very , '' he said . 
`` Just seasonable weather for the time of year , '' said the mariner , taking no denial . 
`` Quite , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
The mariner produced a toothpick , and -LRB- saving his regard -RRB- was engrossed thereby for some minutes . 
His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr. Marvel 's dusty figure , and the books beside him . 
As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket . 
He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel 's appearance with this suggestion of opulence . 
Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination . 
`` Books ? '' 
he said suddenly , noisily finishing with the toothpick . 
Mr. Marvel started and looked at them . 
`` Oh , yes , '' he said . 
`` Yes , they 're books . '' 
`` There 's some ex-traordinary things in books , '' said the mariner . 
`` I believe you , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And some extra-ordinary things out of 'em , '' said the mariner . 
`` True likewise , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
He eyed his interlocutor , and then glanced about him . 
`` There 's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers , for example , '' said the mariner . 
`` There are . '' 
`` In this newspaper , '' said the mariner . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` There 's a story , '' said the mariner , fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate ; `` there 's a story about an Invisible Man , for instance . '' 
Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing . 
`` What will they be writing next ? '' 
he asked faintly . 
`` Ostria , or America ? '' 
`` Neither , '' said the mariner . 
`` Here . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , starting . 
`` When I say here , '' said the mariner , to Mr. Marvel 's intense relief , `` I do n't of course mean here in this place , I mean hereabouts . '' 
`` An Invisible Man ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And what 's he been up to ? '' 
`` Everything , '' said the mariner , controlling Marvel with his eye , and then amplifying , `` every -- blessed -- thing . '' 
`` I ai n't seen a paper these four days , '' said Marvel . 
`` Iping 's the place he started at , '' said the mariner . 
`` In-deed ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` He started there . 
And where he came from , nobody do n't seem to know . 
Here it is : ` Pe-culiar Story from Iping . ' 
And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong -- extra-ordinary . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But then , it 's an extra-ordinary story . 
There is a clergyman and a medical gent witnesses -- saw ` im all right and proper -- or leastways did n't see ` im . 
He was staying , it says , at the ` Coach an ' Horses , ' and no one do n't seem to have been aware of his misfortune , it says , aware of his misfortune , until in an Altercation in the inn , it says , his bandages on his head was torn off . 
It was then ob-served that his head was invisible . 
Attempts were At Once made to secure him , but casting off his garments , it says , he succeeded in escaping , but not until after a desperate struggle , in which he had inflicted serious injuries , it says , on our worthy and able constable , Mr. J. A. Jaffers . 
Pretty straight story , eh ? 
Names and everything . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , looking nervously about him , trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch , and full of a strange and novel idea . 
`` It sounds most astonishing . '' 
`` Do n't it ? 
Extra-ordinary , I call it . 
Never heard tell of Invisible Men before , I have n't , but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things -- that -- '' `` That all he did ? '' 
asked Marvel , trying to seem at his ease . 
`` It 's enough , ai n't it ? '' 
said the mariner . 
`` Did n't go Back by any chance ? '' 
asked Marvel . 
`` Just escaped and that 's all , eh ? '' 
`` All ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` Why ! 
-- ai n't it enough ? '' 
`` Quite enough , '' said Marvel . 
`` I should think it was enough , '' said the mariner . 
`` I should think it was enough . '' 
`` He did n't have any pals -- it do n't say he had any pals , does it ? '' 
asked Mr. Marvel , anxious . 
`` Ai n't one of a sort enough for you ? '' 
asked the mariner . 
`` No , thank Heaven , as one might say , he did n't . '' 
He nodded his head slowly . 
`` It makes me regular uncomfortable , the bare thought of that chap running about the country ! 
He is at present At Large , and from certain evidence it is supposed that he has -- taken -- took , I suppose they mean -- the road to Port Stowe . 
You see we 're right in it ! 
None of your American wonders , this time . 
And just think of the things he might do ! 
Where 'd you be , if he took a drop over and above , and had a fancy to go for you ? 
Suppose he wants to rob -- who can prevent him ? 
He can trespass , he can burgle , he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man ! 
Easier ! 
For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp , I 'm told . 
And wherever there was liquor he fancied -- '' `` He 's got a tremenjous advantage , certainly , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And -- well ... '' `` You 're right , '' said the mariner . 
`` He has . '' 
All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently , listening for faint footfalls , trying to detect imperceptible movements . 
He seemed on the point of some great resolution . 
He coughed behind his hand . 
He looked about him again , listened , bent towards the mariner , and lowered his voice : `` The fact of it is -- I happen -- to know just a thing or two about this Invisible Man .
