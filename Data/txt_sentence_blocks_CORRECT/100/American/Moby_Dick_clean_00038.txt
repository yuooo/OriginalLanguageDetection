The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! 
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . 
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . 
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . 
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life-preservers . 
So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . 
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . 
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . 
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . 
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat . 
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . 
We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . 
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . 
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length . 
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship 's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern . 
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board . 
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time . 
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing , -- an oar or a lance pole . 
The Hyena There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody 's expense but his own . 
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing . 
He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints . 
And as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good-natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker . 
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke . 
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; `` Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ? '' 
Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen . 
`` Mr. Stubb , '' said I , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil-jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; `` Mr. Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr. Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent . 
I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman 's discretion ? '' 
`` Certain . 
I 've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn . '' 
`` Mr. Flask , '' said I , turning to little King-Post , who was standing close by ; `` you are experienced in these things , and I am not . 
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr. Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death 's jaws ? '' 
`` Ca n't you twist that smaller ? '' 
said Flask . 
`` Yes , that 's the law . 
I should like to see a boat 's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost . 
Ha , ha ! 
the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that ! '' 
Here then , from three impartial witnesses , I had a deliberate statement of the entire case . 
Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck 's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck 's boat ; and finally considering in what a devil 's chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , `` come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee . '' 
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . 
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing . 
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , I felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart . 
Besides , all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be . 
I survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest . 
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault . 
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost . 
Ahab 's Boat and Crew . 
Fedallah `` Who would have thought it , Flask ! '' 
cried Stubb ; `` if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe . 
Oh ! 
he 's a wonderful old man ! '' 
`` I do n't think it so strange , after all , on that account , '' said Flask . 
`` If his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing . 
That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know . '' 
`` I do n't know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel . '' 
Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase . 
So Tamerlane 's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight . 
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect . 
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt ? 
As a general thing , the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not . 
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat 's crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod . 
Therefore he had not solicited a boat 's crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . 
Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . 
Until Cabaco 's published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat 's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter 's chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time . 
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person . 
But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat 's crew being assigned to that boat . 
Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane . 
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown-off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle . 
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last . 
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab 's peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew . 
But one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah . 
He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth 's primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to Genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical Robbins , indulged in mundane amours . 
The Spirit-Spout Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate -LRB- so called -RRB- , being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St. Helena . 
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . 
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . 
Fedallah first descried this jet . 
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . 
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them . 
You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky . 
But when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon-lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew . 
`` There she blows ! '' 
Had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure . 
For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering . 
Walking the deck with quick , side-lunging strides , Ahab commanded the t ` gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread . 
The best man in the ship must take the helm . 
Then , with every mast-head manned , the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind . 
The strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal . 
And had you watched Ahab 's face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring . 
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap . 
On life and death this old man walked . 
But though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night . 
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time . 
This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo ! 
at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been . 
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it . 
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on . 
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick . 
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas .
