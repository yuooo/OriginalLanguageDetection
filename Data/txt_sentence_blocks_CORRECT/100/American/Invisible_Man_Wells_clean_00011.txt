`` Neither one thing nor the other , '' said the Voice . 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` Chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` One minute , '' said the Voice , penetratingly , tremulous with self-control . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger . 
`` You think I 'm just imagination ? 
Just imagination ? '' 
`` What else can you be ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rubbing the back of his neck . 
`` Very well , '' said the Voice , in a tone of relief . 
`` Then I 'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently . '' 
`` But where are yer ? '' 
The Voice made no answer . 
Whizz came a flint , apparently out of the air , and missed Mr. Marvel 's shoulder by a hair 's - breadth . 
Mr. Marvel , turning , saw a flint jerk up into the air , trace a complicated path , hang for a moment , and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity . 
He was too amazed to dodge . 
Whizz it came , and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud . 
Then he started to run , tripped over an unseen obstacle , and came head over heels into a sitting position . 
`` Now , '' said the Voice , as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp . 
`` Am I imagination ? '' 
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet , and was immediately rolled over again . 
He lay quiet for a moment . 
`` If you struggle any more , '' said the Voice , `` I shall throw the flint at your head . '' 
`` It 's a fair do , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , sitting up , taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile . 
`` I do n't understand it . 
Stones flinging themselves . 
Stones talking . 
Put yourself down . 
Rot away . 
I 'm done . '' 
The third flint fell . 
`` It 's very simple , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm an invisible man . '' 
`` Tell us something I do n't know , '' said Mr. Marvel , gasping with pain . 
`` Where you 've hid -- how you do it -- I _ do n't _ know . 
I 'm beat . '' 
`` That 's all , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's what I want you to understand . '' 
`` Anyone could see that . 
There is no need for you to be so confounded impatient , mister . 
Now then . 
Give us a notion . 
How are you hid ? '' 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's the great point . 
And what I want you to understand is this -- '' `` But whereabouts ? '' 
interrupted Mr. Marvel . 
`` Here ! 
Six yards in front of you . '' 
`` Oh , come ! 
I ai n't blind . 
You 'll be telling me next you 're just thin air . 
I 'm not one of your ignorant tramps -- '' `` Yes , I am -- thin air . 
You 're looking through me . '' 
`` What ! 
Ai n't there any stuff to you . 
Vox et -- what is it ? 
-- jabber . 
Is it that ? '' 
`` I am just a human being -- solid , needing food and drink , needing covering too -- But I 'm invisible . 
You see ? 
Invisible . 
Simple idea . 
Invisible . '' 
`` What , real like ? '' 
`` Yes , real . '' 
`` Let 's have a hand of you , '' said Marvel , `` if you are real . 
It wo n't be so darn out-of-the-way like , then -- Lord ! '' 
he said , `` how you made me jump ! 
-- gripping me like that ! '' 
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers , and his fingers went timorously up the arm , patted a muscular chest , and explored a bearded face . 
Marvel 's face was astonishment . 
`` I 'm dashed ! '' 
he said . 
`` If this do n't beat cock-fighting ! 
Most remarkable ! 
-- And there I can see a rabbit clean through you , ` arf a mile away ! 
Not a bit of you visible -- except -- '' He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly . 
`` You ` ave n't been eatin ' bread and cheese ? '' 
he asked , holding the invisible arm . 
`` You 're quite right , and it 's not quite assimilated into the system . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Sort of ghostly , though . '' 
`` Of course , all this is n't half so wonderful as you think . '' 
`` It 's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Howjer manage it ! 
How the dooce is it done ? '' 
`` It 's too long a story . 
And besides -- '' `` I tell you , the whole business fairly beats me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` What I want to say at present is this : I need help . 
I have come to that -- I came upon you suddenly . 
I was wandering , mad with rage , naked , impotent . 
I could have murdered . 
And I saw you -- '' `` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I came up behind you -- hesitated -- went on -- '' Mr. Marvel 's expression was eloquent . ''
