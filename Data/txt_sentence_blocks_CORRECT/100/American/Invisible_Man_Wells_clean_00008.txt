No one ventured upstairs . 
How the stranger occupied himself is unknown . 
Now and then he would stride violently up and down , and twice came an outburst of curses , a tearing of paper , and a violent smashing of bottles . 
The little group of scared but curious people increased . 
Mrs. Huxter came over ; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties -- for it was Whit Monday -- joined the group with confused interrogations . 
Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds . 
He could see nothing , but gave reason for supposing that he did , and others of the Iping youth presently joined him . 
It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays , and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths , a shooting gallery , and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy . 
The gentlemen wore blue jerseys , the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes . 
Woodyer , of the `` Purple Fawn , '' and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns -LRB- which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee -RRB- across the road . 
And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . 
In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . 
So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room . 
About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar . 
`` Mrs. Hall , '' he said . 
Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall . 
Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that . 
Hall was still out . 
She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it . 
`` Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? '' 
she said . 
`` Why was n't my breakfast laid ? 
Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? 
Do you think I live without eating ? '' 
`` Why is n't my bill paid ? '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` That 's what I want to know . '' 
`` I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance -- '' `` I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . 
You ca n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? '' 
The stranger swore briefly but vividly . 
`` Nar , nar ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . 
It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him . 
His next words showed as much . 
`` Look here , my good woman -- '' he began . 
`` Do n't ` good woman ' me , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` I 've told you my remittance has n't come . '' 
`` Remittance indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Still , I daresay in my pocket -- '' `` You told me three days ago that you had n't anything but a sovereign 's worth of silver upon you . '' 
`` Well , I 've found some more -- '' '' ` Ul-lo ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
That seemed to annoy the stranger very much . 
He stamped his foot . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
he said . 
`` That I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And before I take any bills or get any breakfasts , or do any such things whatsoever , you got to tell me one or two things I do n't understand , and what nobody do n't understand , and what everybody is very anxious to understand . 
I want to know what you been doing t ` my chair upstairs , and I want to know how 't is your room was empty , and how you got in again . 
Them as stops in this house comes in by the doors -- that 's the rule of the house , and that you _ did n't _ do , and what I want to know is how you did come in . 
And I want to know -- '' Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched , stamped his foot , and said , `` Stop ! '' 
with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly . 
`` You do n't understand , '' he said , `` who I am or what I am . 
I 'll show you . 
By Heaven ! 
I 'll show you . '' 
Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it . 
The centre of his face became a black cavity . 
`` Here , '' he said . 
He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she , staring at his metamorphosed face , accepted automatically . 
Then , when she saw what it was , she screamed loudly , dropped it , and staggered back . 
The nose -- it was the stranger 's nose ! 
pink and shining -- rolled on the floor . 
Then he removed his spectacles , and everyone in the bar gasped . 
He took off his hat , and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages . 
For a moment they resisted him . 
A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar . 
`` Oh , my Gard ! '' 
said some one . 
Then off they came . 
It was worse than anything . 
Mrs. Hall , standing open-mouthed and horror-struck , shrieked at what she saw , and made for the door of the house . 
Everyone began to move . 
They were prepared for scars , disfigurements , tangible horrors , but nothing ! 
The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar , making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them . 
Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps . 
For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation , was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him , and then -- nothingness , no visible thing at all ! 
People down the village heard shouts and shrieks , and looking up the street saw the `` Coach and Horses '' violently firing out its humanity . 
They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her , and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie , who , emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult , had come upon the headless stranger from behind . 
These increased suddenly . 
Forthwith everyone all down the street , the sweetstuff seller , cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant , the swing man , little boys and girls , rustic dandies , smart wenches , smocked elders and aproned gipsies -- began running towards the inn , and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people , and rapidly increasing , swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested , in front of Mrs. Hall 's establishment . 
Everyone seemed eager to talk at once , and the result was Babel . 
A small group supported Mrs. Hall , who was picked up in a state of collapse . 
There was a conference , and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness . 
`` O Bogey ! '' 
`` What 's he been doin ' , then ? '' 
`` Ai n't hurt the girl , ` as ` e ? '' 
`` Run at en with a knife , I believe . '' 
`` No ` ed , I tell ye . 
I do n't mean no manner of speaking . 
I mean marn ` ithout a ` ed ! '' 
`` Narnsense ! 
't is some conjuring trick . '' 
`` Fetched off ` is wrapping , ' e did -- '' In its struggles to see in through the open door , the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge , with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn . 
`` He stood for a moment , I heerd the gal scream , and he turned . 
I saw her skirts whisk , and he went after her . 
Did n't take ten seconds .
