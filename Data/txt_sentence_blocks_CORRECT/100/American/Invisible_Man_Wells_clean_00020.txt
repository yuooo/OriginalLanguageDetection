The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning . 
`` Have you a bandage on ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Kemp , and then roused himself . 
`` I say ! '' 
he said . 
`` But this is nonsense . 
It 's some trick . '' 
He stepped forward suddenly , and his hand , extended towards the bandage , met invisible fingers . 
He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed . 
`` Keep steady , Kemp , for God 's sake ! 
I want help badly . 
Stop ! '' 
The hand gripped his arm . 
He struck at it . 
`` Kemp ! '' 
cried the Voice . 
`` Kemp ! 
Keep steady ! '' 
and the grip tightened . 
A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp . 
The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder , and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed . 
He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth . 
The Invisible Man had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely . 
`` Listen to reason , will you ? '' 
said the Invisible Man , sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs . 
`` By Heaven ! 
you 'll madden me in a minute ! 
`` Lie still , you fool ! '' 
bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp 's ear . 
Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still . 
`` If you shout , I 'll smash your face , '' said the Invisible Man , relieving his mouth . 
`` I 'm an Invisible Man . 
It 's no foolishness , and no magic . 
I really am an Invisible Man . 
And I want your help . 
I do n't want to hurt you , but if you behave like a frantic rustic , I must . 
Do n't you remember me , Kemp ? 
Griffin , of University College ? '' 
`` Let me get up , '' said Kemp . 
`` I 'll stop where I am . 
And let me sit quiet for a minute . '' 
He sat up and felt his neck . 
`` I am Griffin , of University College , and I have made myself invisible . 
I am just an ordinary man -- a man you have known -- made invisible . '' 
`` Griffin ? '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Griffin , '' answered the Voice . 
A younger student than you were , almost an albino , six feet high , and broad , with a pink and white face and red eyes , who won the medal for chemistry . '' 
`` I am confused , '' said Kemp . 
`` My brain is rioting . 
What has this to do with Griffin ? '' 
`` I am Griffin . '' 
Kemp thought . 
`` It 's horrible , '' he said . 
`` But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible ? '' 
`` It 's no devilry . 
It 's a process , sane and intelligible enough -- '' `` It 's horrible ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` How on earth -- ? '' 
`` It 's horrible enough . 
But I 'm wounded and in pain , and tired ... Great God ! 
Kemp , you are a man . 
Take it steady . 
Give me some food and drink , and let me sit down here . '' 
Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room , then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed . 
It creaked , and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so . 
He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again . 
`` This beats ghosts , '' he said , and laughed stupidly . 
`` That 's better . 
Thank Heaven , you 're getting sensible ! '' 
`` Or silly , '' said Kemp , and knuckled his eyes . 
`` Give me some whiskey . 
I 'm near dead . '' 
`` It did n't feel so . 
Where are you ? 
If I get up shall I run into you ? 
There ! 
all right . 
Whiskey ? 
Here . 
Where shall I give it to you ? '' 
The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him . 
He let go by an effort ; his instinct was all against it . 
It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair . 
He stared at it in infinite perplexity . 
`` This is -- this must be -- hypnotism . 
You have suggested you are invisible . '' 
`` Nonsense , '' said the Voice . 
`` It 's frantic . '' 
`` Listen to me . '' 
`` I demonstrated conclusively this morning , '' began Kemp , `` that invisibility -- '' `` Never mind what you 've demonstrated ! 
-- I 'm starving , '' said the Voice , `` and the night is chilly to a man without clothes . '' 
`` Food ? '' 
said Kemp . 
The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man rapping it down . 
`` Have you a dressing-gown ? ''
