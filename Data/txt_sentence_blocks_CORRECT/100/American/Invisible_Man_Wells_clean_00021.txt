Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone . 
He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet . 
`` This do ? '' 
he asked . 
It was taken from him . 
It hung limp for a moment in mid-air , fluttered weirdly , stood full and decorous buttoning itself , and sat down in his chair . 
`` Drawers , socks , slippers would be a comfort , '' said the Unseen , curtly . 
`` And food . '' 
`` Anything . 
But this is the insanest thing I ever was in , in my life ! '' 
He turned out his drawers for the articles , and then went downstairs to ransack his larder . 
He came back with some cold cutlets and bread , pulled up a light table , and placed them before his guest . 
`` Never mind knives , '' said his visitor , and a cutlet hung in mid-air , with a sound of gnawing . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
said Kemp , and sat down on a bedroom chair . 
`` I always like to get something about me before I eat , '' said the Invisible Man , with a full mouth , eating greedily . 
`` Queer fancy ! '' 
`` I suppose that wrist is all right , '' said Kemp . 
`` Trust me , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Of all the strange and wonderful -- '' `` Exactly . 
But it 's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging . 
My first stroke of luck ! 
Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night . 
You must stand that ! 
It 's a filthy nuisance , my blood showing , is n't it ? 
Quite a clot over there . 
Gets visible as it coagulates , I see . 
It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive ... . 
I 've been in the house three hours . '' 
`` But how 's it done ? '' 
began Kemp , in a tone of exasperation . 
`` Confound it ! 
The whole business -- it 's unreasonable from beginning to end . '' 
`` Quite reasonable , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Perfectly reasonable . '' 
He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle . 
Kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown . 
A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder , made a triangle of light under the left ribs . 
`` What were the shots ? '' 
he asked . 
`` How did the shooting begin ? '' 
`` There was a real fool of a man -- a sort of confederate of mine -- curse him ! 
-- who tried to steal my money . 
Has done so . '' 
`` Is he invisible too ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Ca n't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that ? 
I 'm hungry -- in pain . 
And you want me to tell stories ! '' 
Kemp got up . 
`` You did n't do any shooting ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Not me , '' said his visitor . 
`` Some fool I 'd never seen fired at random . 
A lot of them got scared . 
They all got scared at me . 
Curse them ! 
-- I say -- I want more to eat than this , Kemp . '' 
`` I 'll see what there is to eat downstairs , '' said Kemp . 
`` Not much , I 'm afraid . '' 
After he had done eating , and he made a heavy meal , the Invisible Man demanded a cigar . 
He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a knife , and cursed when the outer leaf loosened . 
It was strange to see him smoking ; his mouth , and throat , pharynx and nares , became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast . 
`` This blessed gift of smoking ! '' 
he said , and puffed vigorously . 
`` I 'm lucky to have fallen upon you , Kemp . 
You must help me . 
Fancy tumbling on you just now ! 
I 'm in a devilish scrape -- I 've been mad , I think . 
The things I have been through ! 
But we will do things yet . 
Let me tell you -- '' He helped himself to more whiskey and soda . 
Kemp got up , looked about him , and fetched a glass from his spare room . 
`` It 's wild -- but I suppose I may drink . '' 
`` You have n't changed much , Kemp , these dozen years . 
You fair men do n't . 
Cool and methodical -- after the first collapse . 
I must tell you . 
We will work together ! '' 
`` But how was it all done ? '' 
said Kemp , `` and how did you get like this ? '' 
`` For God 's sake , let me smoke in peace for a little while ! 
And then I will begin to tell you . '' 
But the story was not told that night . 
The Invisible Man 's wrist was growing painful ; he was feverish , exhausted , and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn . 
He spoke in fragments of Marvel , he smoked faster , his voice grew angry . 
Kemp tried to gather what he could . 
`` He was afraid of me , I could see that he was afraid of me , '' said the Invisible Man many times over . 
`` He meant to give me the slip -- he was always casting about ! 
What a fool I was ! '' 
`` The cur ! 
`` I should have killed him ! '' 
`` Where did you get the money ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
The Invisible Man was silent for a space . 
`` I ca n't tell you to-night , '' he said . 
He groaned suddenly and leant forward , supporting his invisible head on invisible hands . 
`` Kemp , '' he said , `` I 've had no sleep for near three days , except a couple of dozes of an hour or so . 
I must sleep soon . ''
