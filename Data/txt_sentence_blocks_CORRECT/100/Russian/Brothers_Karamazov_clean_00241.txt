`` What have I come for ? '' 
she began again with nervous haste : `` to embrace your feet , to press your hands like this , till it hurts - you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze them - to tell you again that you are my god , my joy , to tell you that I love you madly , '' she moaned in anguish , and suddenly pressed his hand greedily to her lips . 
Tears streamed from her eyes . 
Alyosha stood speechless and confounded ; he had never expected what he was seeing . 
`` Love is over , Mitya ! '' 
Katya began again , `` But the past is painfully dear to me . 
Know that you will always be so . 
But now let what might have been come true for one minute , '' she faltered , with a drawn smile , looking into his face joyfully again . 
`` You love another woman , and I love another man , and yet I shall love you for ever , and you will love me ; do you know that ? 
Do you hear ? 
Love me , love me all your life ! '' 
she cried , with a quiver almost of menace in her voice . 
`` I shall love you , and ... do you know , Katya , '' Mitya began , drawing a deep breath at each word , `` do you know , five days ago , that same evening , I loved you ... . 
When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life ! 
So it will be , so it will always be - '' So they murmured to one another frantic words , almost meaningless , perhaps not even true , but at that moment it was all true , and they both believed what they said implicitly . 
`` Katya , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` do you believe I murdered him ? 
I know you do n't believe it now , but then ... when you gave evidence ... . 
Surely , surely you did not believe it ! '' 
`` I did not believe it even then . 
I 've never believed it . 
I hated you , and for a moment I persuaded myself . 
While I was giving evidence I persuaded myself and believed it , but when I 'd finished speaking I left off believing it at once . 
Do n't doubt that ! 
I have forgotten that I came here to punish myself , '' she said , with a new expression in her voice , quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before . 
`` Woman , yours is a heavy burden , '' broke , as it were , involuntarily from Mitya . 
`` Let me go , '' she whispered . 
`` I 'll come again . 
It 's more than I can bear now . '' 
She was getting up from her place , but suddenly uttered a loud scream and staggered back . 
Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room . 
No one had expected her . 
Katya moved swiftly to the door , but when she reached Grushenka , she stopped suddenly , turned as white as chalk and moaned softly , almost in a whisper : `` Forgive me ! '' 
Grushenka stared at her and , pausing for an instant , in a vindictive , venomous voice , answered : `` We are full of hatred , my girl , you and I ! 
We are both full of hatred ! 
As though we could forgive one another ! 
Save him , and I 'll worship you all my life . '' 
`` You wo n't forgive her ! '' 
cried Mitya , with frantic reproach . 
`` Do n't be anxious , I 'll save him for you ! '' 
Katya whispered rapidly , and she ran out of the room . 
`` And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness herself ? ' 
Mitya exclaimed bitterly again . 
`` Mitya , do n't dare to blame her ; you have no right to ! '' 
Alyosha cried hotly . 
`` Her proud lips spoke , not her heart , '' Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust . 
`` If she saves you I 'll forgive her everything - '' She stopped speaking , as though suppressing something . 
She could not yet recover herself . 
She had come in , as appeared afterwards , accidentally , with no suspicion of what she would meet . 
`` Alyosha , run after her ! '' 
Mitya cried to his brother ; `` tell her ... I do n't know ... do n't let her go away like this ! '' 
`` I 'll come to you again at nightfall , '' said Alyosha , and he ran after Katya . 
He overtook her outside the hospital grounds . 
She walking fast , but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly : `` No , before that woman I ca n't punish myself ! 
I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end . 
She would not forgive me ... . 
I like her for that ! '' 
she added , in an unnatural voice , and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment . 
`` My brother did not expect this in the least , '' muttered Alyosha . 
`` He was sure she would not come - '' `` No doubt . 
Let us leave that , '' she snapped . 
`` Listen : I ca n't go with you to the funeral now . 
I 've sent them flowers . 
I think they still have money . 
If necessary , tell them I 'll never abandon them ... . 
Now leave me , leave me , please . 
You are late as it is - the bells are ringing for the service ... . 
Leave me , please ! '' 
Ilusha 's Funeral . 
The Speech at the Stone HE really was late . 
They had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him . 
It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha . 
He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced . 
At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys , Ilusha 's schoolfellows . 
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last . 
There were about twelve of them , they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders . 
`` Father will cry , be with father , '' Ilusha had told them as he lay dying , and the boys remembered it . 
Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them . 
`` How glad I am you 've come , Karamazov ! '' 
he cried , holding out his hand to Alyosha . 
`` It 's awful here . 
It 's really horrible to see it . 
Snegiryov is not drunk , we know for a fact he 's had nothing to drink to-day , but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly , but this is awful . 
Karamazov , if I am not keeping you , one question before you go in ? '' 
`` What is it , Kolya ? '' 
said Alyosha . 
`` Is your brother innocent or guilty ? 
Was it he killed your father or was it the valet ? 
As you say , so it will be . 
I have n't slept for the last four nights for thinking of it . '' 
`` The valet killed him , my brother is innocent , '' answered Alyosha . 
`` That 's what I said , '' cried Smurov . 
`` So he will perish an innocent victim ! '' 
exclaimed Kolya ; `` though he is ruined he is happy ! 
I could envy him ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? 
How can you ? 
Why ? '' 
cried Alyosha surprised . 
`` Oh , if I , too , could sacrifice myself some day for truth ! '' 
said Kolya with enthusiasm .
