Princess Mary 's embarrassment on her people 's account was quite unnecessary . 
They were not in the least abashed . 
The old woman , lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers , had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it , and sat quietly in her armchair , though hoping to be offered another cup of tea . 
Ivanushka , sipping out of her saucer , looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men . 
`` Where have you been ? 
To Kiev ? '' 
Prince Andrew asked the old woman . 
`` I have , good sir , '' she answered garrulously . 
`` Just at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint . 
And now I 'm from Kolyazin , master , where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed . '' 
`` And was Ivanushka with you ? '' 
`` I go by myself , benefactor , '' said Ivanushka , trying to speak in a bass voice . 
`` I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo ... '' Pelageya interrupted her companion ; she evidently wished to tell what she had seen . 
`` In Kolyazin , master , a wonderful blessing has been revealed . '' 
`` What is it ? 
Some new relics ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` Andrew , do leave off , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Do n't tell him , Pelageya . '' 
`` No ... why not , my dear , why should n't I ? 
I like him . 
He is kind , he is one of God 's chosen , he 's a benefactor , he once gave me ten rubles , I remember . 
When I was in Kiev , Crazy Cyril says to me -LRB- he 's one of God 's own and goes barefoot summer and winter -RRB- , he says , ` Why are you not going to the right place ? 
Go to Kolyazin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed . ' 
On hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went . '' 
All were silent , only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones , drawing in her breath . 
`` So I come , master , and the people say to me : ' A great blessing has been revealed , holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother , the Holy Virgin Mother of God ' ... '' `` All right , all right , you can tell us afterwards , '' said Princess Mary , flushing . 
`` Let me ask her , '' said Pierre . 
`` Did you see it yourselves ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` Oh , yes , master , I was found worthy . 
Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven , and from the blessed Mother 's cheek it drops and drops ... '' `` But , dear me , that must be a fraud ! '' 
said Pierre , naively , who had listened attentively to the pilgrim . 
`` Oh , master , what are you saying ? '' 
exclaimed the horrified Pelageya , turning to Princess Mary for support . 
`` They impose on the people , '' he repeated . 
`` Lord Jesus Christ ! '' 
exclaimed the pilgrim woman , crossing herself . 
`` Oh , do n't speak so , master ! 
There was a general who did not believe , and said , ` The monks cheat , ' and as soon as he 'd said it he went blind . 
And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said , ` Believe in me and I will make you whole . ' 
So he begged : ` Take me to her , take me to her . ' 
It 's the real truth I 'm telling you , I saw it myself . 
So he was brought , quite blind , straight to her , and he goes up to her and falls down and says , ` Make me whole , ' says he , ` and I 'll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me . ' 
I saw it myself , master , the star is fixed into the icon . 
Well , and what do you think ? 
He received his sight ! 
It 's a sin to speak so . 
God will punish you , '' she said admonishingly , turning to Pierre . 
`` How did the star get into the icon ? '' 
Pierre asked . 
`` And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general ? '' 
said Prince Andrew , with a smile . 
Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands . 
`` Oh , master , master , what a sin ! 
And you who have a son ! '' 
she began , her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red . 
`` Master , what have you said ? 
God forgive you ! '' 
And she crossed herself . 
`` Lord forgive him ! 
My dear , what does it mean ? 
... '' she asked , turning to Princess Mary . 
She got up and , almost crying , began to arrange her wallet . 
She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said , and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house . 
`` Now , why need you do it ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Why did you come to me ? 
... '' `` Come , Pelageya , I was joking , '' said Pierre . 
`` Princesse , ma parole , je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser . 
* I did not mean anything , I was only joking , '' he said , smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense . 
`` It was all my fault , and Andrew was only joking . '' 
* `` Princess , on my word , I did not wish to offend her . '' 
Pelageya stopped doubtfully , but in Pierre 's face there was such a look of sincere penitence , and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre , that she was gradually reassured . 
The pilgrim woman was appeased and , being encouraged to talk , gave a long account of Father Amphilochus , who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense , and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs , and how she , taking some dried bread with her , had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints . 
`` I 'd pray awhile to one , ponder awhile , then go on to another . 
I 'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics , and there was such peace all around , such blessedness , that one do n't want to come out , even into the light of heaven again . '' 
Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously . 
Prince Andrew went out of the room , and then , leaving `` God 's folk '' to finish their tea , Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room . 
`` You are very kind , '' she said to him . 
`` Oh , I really did not mean to hurt her feelings . 
I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them . '' 
Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately . 
`` I have known you a long time , you see , and am as fond of you as of a brother , '' she said . 
`` How do you find Andrew ? '' 
she added hurriedly , not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words . 
`` I am very anxious about him . 
His health was better in the winter , but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure . 
And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually . 
He has not a character like us women who , when we suffer , can weep away our sorrows . 
He keeps it all within him . 
Today he is cheerful and in good spirits , but that is the effect of your visit -- he is not often like that . 
If you could persuade him to go abroad . 
He needs activity , and this quiet regular life is very bad for him . 
Others do n't notice it , but I see it . '' 
Toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door , hearing the bells of the old prince 's carriage approaching . 
Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch . 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
asked the old prince , noticing Pierre as he got out of , the carriage . 
`` Ah !
