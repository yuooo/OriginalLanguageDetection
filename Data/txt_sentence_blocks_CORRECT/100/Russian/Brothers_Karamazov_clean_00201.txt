Where can one sit down ? '' 
He went to the other end of the table , moved up a chair and sat down on it . 
`` Why do you look at me without speaking ? 
We only come with one question , and I swear I wo n't go without an answer . 
Has the young lady , Katerina Ivanovna , been with you ? '' 
Smerdyakov still remained silent , looking quietly at Ivan as before . 
Suddenly , with a motion of his hand , he turned his face away . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` What do you mean by ` nothing ' ? '' 
`` Yes , she has . 
It 's no matter to you . 
Let me alone . '' 
`` No , I wo n't let you alone . 
Tell me , when was she here ? '' 
`` Why , I 'd quite forgotten about her , '' said Smerdyakov , with a scornful smile , and turning his face to Ivan again , he stared at him with a look of frenzied hatred , the same look that he had fixed on him at their last interview , a month before . 
`` You seem very ill yourself , your face is sunken ; you do n't look like yourself , '' he said to Ivan . 
`` Never mind my health , tell me what I ask you. , `` But why are your eyes so yellow ? 
The whites are quite yellow . 
Are you so worried ? '' 
He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright . 
`` Listen ; I 've told you I wo n't go away without an answer ! '' 
Ivan cried , intensely irritated . 
`` Why do you keep pestering me ? 
Why do you torment me ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with a look of suffering . 
`` Damn it ! 
I 've nothing to do with you . 
Just answer my question and I 'll go away . '' 
`` I 've no answer to give you , '' said Smerdyakov , looking down again . 
`` You may be sure I 'll make you answer ! '' 
`` Why are you so uneasy ? '' 
Smerdyakov stared at him , not simply with contempt , but almost with repulsion . 
`` Is this because the trial begins to-morrow ? 
Nothing will happen to you ; ca n't you believe that at last ? 
Go home , go to bed and sleep in peace , do n't be afraid of anything . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ... . 
What have I to be afraid of to-morrow ? '' 
Ivan articulated in astonishment , and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul . 
Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes . 
`` You do n't understand ? '' 
he drawled reproachfully . 
`` It 's a strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce ! '' 
Ivan looked at him speechless . 
The startling , incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his valet , was extraordinary in itself . 
He had not taken such a tone even at their last interview . 
`` I tell you , you 've nothing to be afraid of . 
I wo n't say anything about you ; there 's no proof against you . 
I say , how your hands are trembling ! 
Why are your fingers moving like that ? 
Go home , you did not murder him . '' 
Ivan started . 
He remembered Alyosha . 
`` I know it was not I , '' he faltered . 
`` Do you ? '' 
Smerdyakov caught him up again . 
Ivan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder . 
`` Tell me everything , you viper ! 
Tell me everything ! '' 
Smerdyakov was not in the least scared . 
He only riveted his eyes on Ivan with insane hatred . 
`` Well , it was you who murdered him , if that 's it , '' he whispered furiously . 
Ivan sank back on his chair , as though pondering something . 
He laughed malignantly . 
`` You mean my going away . 
What you talked about last time ? '' 
`` You stood before me last time and understood it all , and you understand it now . '' 
`` All I understand is that you are mad . '' 
`` Are n't you tired of it ? 
Here we are face to face ; what 's the use of going on keeping up a farce to each other ? 
Are you still trying to throw it all on me , to my face ? 
You murdered him ; you are the real murderer , I was only your instrument , your faithful servant , and it was following your words I did it . '' 
`` Did it ? 
Why , did you murder him ? '' 
Ivan turned cold . 
Something seemed to give way in his brain , and he shuddered all over with a cold shiver . 
Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly ; probably the genuineness of Ivan 's horror struck him . 
`` You do n't mean to say you really did not know ? '' 
he faltered mistrustfully , looking with a forced smile into his eyes . 
Ivan still gazed at him , and seemed unable to speak . 
Ach , Vanka 's gone to Petersburg ; I wo n't wait till he comes back , suddenly echoed in his head . 
`` Do you know , I am afraid that you are a dream , a phantom sitting before me , '' he muttered . 
`` There 's no phantom here , but only us two and one other . 
No doubt he is here , that third , between us . '' 
`` Who is he ? 
Who is here ? 
What third person ? '' 
Ivan cried in alarm , looking about him , his eyes hastily searching in every corner . 
`` That third is God Himself - Providence . 
He is the third beside us now . 
Only do n't look for Him , you wo n't find him . '' 
`` It 's a lie that you killed him ! '' 
Ivan cried madly . 
`` You are mad , or teasing me again ! '' 
Smerdyakov , as before , watched him curiously , with no sign of fear . 
He could still scarcely get over his incredulity ; he still fancied that Ivan knew everything and was trying to `` throw it all on him to his face . '' 
`` Wait a minute , '' he said at last in a weak voice , and suddenly bringing up his left leg from under the table , he began turning up his trouser leg . 
He was wearing long white stockings and slippers . 
Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking .
