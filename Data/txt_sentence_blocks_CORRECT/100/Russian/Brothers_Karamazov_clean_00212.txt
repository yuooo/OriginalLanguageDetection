Is it because I am base ? 
I am not a coward . 
Is it from love of life ? 
How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself ? 
Yes , it was he told me so . '' 
`` And you are quite convinced that there has been someone here ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , on that sofa in the corner . 
You would have driven him away . 
You did drive him away : he disappeared when you arrived . 
I love your face , Alyosha . 
Did you know that I loved your face ? 
And he is myself , Alyosha . 
All that 's base in me , all that 's mean and contemptible . 
Yes , I am a romantic . 
He guessed it ... though it 's a libel . 
He is frightfully stupid ; but it 's to his advantage . 
He has cunning , animal cunning - he knew how to infuriate me . 
He kept taunting me with believing in him , and that was how he made me listen to him . 
He fooled me like a boy . 
He told me a great deal that was true about myself , though . 
I should never have owned it to myself . 
Do you know , Alyosha , '' Ivan added in an intensely earnest and confidential tone , `` I should be awfully glad to think that it was he and not I. '' `` He has worn you out , '' said Alyosha , looking compassionately at his brother . 
`` He 's been teasing me . 
And you know he does it so cleverly , so cleverly . 
` Conscience ! 
What is conscience ? 
I make it up for myself . 
Why am I tormented by it ? 
From habit . 
From the universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years . 
So let us give it up , and we shall be gods . ' 
It was he said that , it was he said that ! '' 
`` And not you , not you ? '' 
Alyosha could not help crying , looking frankly at his brother . 
`` Never mind him , anyway ; have done with him and forget him . 
And let him take with him all that you curse now , and never come back ! '' 
`` Yes , but he is spiteful . 
He laughed at me . 
He was impudent , Alyosha , '' Ivan said , with a shudder of offence . 
`` But he was unfair to me , unfair to me about lots of things . 
He told lies about me to my face . 
` Oh , you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue : to confess you murdered your father , that the valet murdered him at your instigation . ' '' 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha interposed , `` restrain yourself . 
It was not you murdered him . 
It 's not true ! '' 
`` That 's what he says , he , and he knows it . 
` You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue , and you do n't believe in virtue ; that 's what tortures you and makes you angry , that 's why you are so vindictive . ' 
He said that to me about me and he knows what he says . '' 
`` It 's you say that , not he , '' exclaimed Alyosha mournfully , `` and you say it because you are ill and delirious , tormenting yourself . '' 
`` No , he knows what he says . 
` You are going from pride , ' he says . 
` You 'll stand up and say it was I killed him , and why do you writhe with horror ? 
You are lying ! 
I despise your opinion , I despise your horror ! ' 
He said that about me . 
` And do you know you are longing for their praise - `` he is a criminal , a murderer , but what a generous soul ; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed . '' 
That 's a lie Alyosha ! '' 
Ivan cried suddenly , with flashing eyes . 
`` I do n't want the low rabble to praise me , I swear I do n't ! 
That 's a lie ! 
That 's why I threw the glass at him and it broke against his ugly face . '' 
`` Brother , calm yourself , stop ! '' 
Alyosha entreated him . 
`` Yes , he knows how to torment one . 
He 's cruel , '' Ivan went on , unheeding . 
`` I had an inkling from the first what he came for . 
` Granting that you go through pride , still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia , and Mitya would be acquitted , while you would only be punished , with moral condemnation ' -LRB- ` Do you hear ? ' 
he laughed then -RRB- - ` and some people will praise you . 
But now Smerdyakov 's dead , he has hanged himself , and who 'll believe you alone ? 
But yet you are going , you are going , you 'll go all the same , you 've decided to go . 
What are you going for now ? ' 
That 's awful , Alyosha . 
I ca n't endure such questions . 
Who dare ask me such questions ? '' 
`` Brother , '' interposed Alyosha - his heart sank with terror , but he still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason - `` how could he have told you of Smerdyakov 's death before I came , when no one knew of it and there was no time for anyone to know of it ? '' 
`` He told me , '' said Ivan firmly , refusing to admit a doubt . 
`` It was all he did talk about , if you come to that . 
` And it would be all right if you believed in virtue , ' he said . 
` No matter if they disbelieve you , you are going for the sake of principle . 
But you are a little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch , and what do you want with virtue ? 
Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to anyone ? 
Because you do n't know yourself why you go ! 
Oh , you 'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go ! 
And can you have made up your mind ? 
You 've not made up your mind . 
You 'll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not . 
But you will go ; you know you 'll go . 
You know that whichever way you decide , the decision does not depend on you . 
You 'll go because you wo n't dare not to go . 
Why wo n't you dare ? 
You must guess that for yourself . 
That 's a riddle for you ! ' 
He got up and went away . 
You came and he went . 
He called me a coward , Alyosha ! 
Le mot de l'enigme is that I am a coward . 
` It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth . 
` It was he added that - he ! 
And Smerdyakov said the same .
