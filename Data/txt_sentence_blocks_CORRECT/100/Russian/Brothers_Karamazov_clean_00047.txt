`` Go away ! 
You 're a creature for sale '' screamed Katerina Ivanovna . 
Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face . 
`` For sale indeed ! 
You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once ; you brought your beauty for sale . 
You see , I know . '' 
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked , and would have rushed at her , but Alyosha held her with all his strength . 
`` Not a step , not a word ! 
Do n't speak , do n't answer her . 
She 'll go away - she 'll go at once . '' 
At that instant Katerina Ivanovna 's two aunts ran in at her cry , and with them a maid-servant . 
All hurried to her . 
`` I will go away , '' said Grushenka , taking up her mantle from the sofa . 
`` Alyosha , darling , see me home ! '' 
`` Go away - go away , make haste ! '' 
cried Alyosha , clasping his hands imploringly . 
`` Dear little Alyosha , see me home ! 
I 've got a pretty little story to tell you on the way . 
I got up this scene for your benefit , Alyosha . 
See me home , dear , you 'll be glad of it afterwards . '' 
Alyosha turned away , wringing his hands . 
Grushenka ran out of the house , laughing musically . 
Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics . 
She sobbed , and was shaken with convulsions . 
Everyone fussed round her . 
`` I warned you , '' said the elder of her aunts . 
`` I tried to prevent your doing this . 
You 're too impulsive . 
How could you do such a thing ? 
You do n't know these creatures , and they say she 's worse than any of them . 
You are too self-willed . '' 
`` She 's a tigress ! '' 
yelled Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Why did you hold me , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? 
I 'd have beaten her - beaten her ! '' 
She could not control herself before Alyosha ; perhaps she did not care to , indeed . 
`` She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold ! '' 
Alyosha withdrew towards the door . 
`` But , my God ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , clasping her hands . 
`` He ! 
He ! 
He could be so dishonourable , so inhuman ! 
Why , he told that creature what happened on that fatal , accursed day ! 
` You brought your beauty for sale , dear young lady . ' 
She knows it ! 
Your brother 's a scoundrel , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
Alyosha wanted to say something , but he could n't find a word . 
His heart ached . 
`` Go away , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
It 's shameful , it 's awful for me ! 
To-morrow , I beg you on my knees , come to-morrow . 
Do n't condemm me . 
Forgive me . 
I do n't know what I shall do with myself now ! '' 
Alyosha walked out into the street reeling . 
He could have wept as she did . 
Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid . 
`` The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov ; it 's been left with us since dinner-time . '' 
Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it , almost unconsciously , into his pocket . 
Another Reputation Ruined IT was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the monastery . 
Alyosha walked quickly along the road , at that hour deserted . 
It was almost night , and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces ahead . 
There were cross-roads half-way . 
A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the cross-roads . 
As soon as Alyosha reached the cross-roads the figure moved out and rushed at him , shouting savagely : `` Your money or your life ! '' 
`` So it 's you , Mitya , '' cried Alyosha , in surprise , violently startled however . 
`` Ha ha ha ! 
You did n't expect me ? 
I wondered where to wait for you . 
By her house ? 
There are three ways from it , and I might have missed you . 
At last I thought of waiting here , for you had to pass here , there 's no other way to the monastery . 
Come , tell me the truth . 
Crush me like a beetle . 
But what 's the matter ? '' 
`` Nothing , brother - it 's the fright you gave me . 
Oh , Dmitri ! 
Father 's blood just now . '' 
-LRB- Alyosha began to cry , he had been on the verge of tears for a long time , and now something seemed to snap in his soul . -RRB- 
`` You almost killed him - cursed him - and now - here - you 're making jokes - ` Your money or your life ! ' '' 
`` Well , what of that ? 
It 's not seemly - is that it ? 
Not suitable in my position ? '' 
`` No - I only - '' `` Stay . 
Look at the night . 
You see what a dark night , what clouds , what a wind has risen . 
I hid here under the willow waiting for you . 
And as God 's above , I suddenly thought , why go on in misery any longer , what is there to wait for ? 
Here I have a willow , a handkerchief , a shirt , I can twist them into a rope in a minute , and braces besides , and why go on burdening the earth , dishonouring it with my vile presence ? 
And then I heard you coming - Heavens , it was as though something flew down to me suddenly . 
So there is a man , then , whom I love . 
Here he is , that man , my dear little brother , whom I love more than anyone in the world , the only one I love in the world . 
And I loved you so much , so much at that moment that I thought , ` I 'll fall on his neck at once . ' 
Then a stupid idea struck me , to have a joke with you and scare you . 
I shouted , like a fool , ` Your money ! ' 
Forgive my foolery - it was only nonsense , and there 's nothing unseemly in my soul ... . 
Damn it all , tell me what 's happened . 
What did she say ? 
Strike me , crush me , do n't spare me !
