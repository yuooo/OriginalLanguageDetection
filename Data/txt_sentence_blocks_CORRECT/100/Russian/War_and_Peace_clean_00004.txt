The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili in the anteroom . 
All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear . 
`` How about my son Boris , Prince ? '' 
said she , hurrying after him into the anteroom . 
`` I ca n't remain any longer in Petersburg . 
Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy . '' 
Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady , even betraying some impatience , she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile , and took his hand that he might not go away . 
`` What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor , and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once ? '' 
said she . 
`` Believe me , Princess , I am ready to do all I can , '' answered Prince Vasili , `` but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor . 
I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn . 
That would be the best way . '' 
The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya , belonging to one of the best families in Russia , but she was poor , and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections . 
She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son . 
It was , in fact , solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna 's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte 's story . 
Prince Vasili 's words frightened her , an embittered look clouded her once handsome face , but only for a moment ; then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasili 's arm more tightly . 
`` Listen to me , Prince , '' said she . 
`` I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again , nor have I ever reminded you of my father 's friendship for you ; but now I entreat you for God 's sake to do this for my son -- and I shall always regard you as a benefactor , '' she added hurriedly . 
`` No , do n't be angry , but promise ! 
I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused . 
Be the kindhearted man you always were , '' she said , trying to smile though tears were in her eyes . 
`` Papa , we shall be late , '' said Princess Helene , turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door . 
Influence in society , however , is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last . 
Prince Vasili knew this , and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him , he would soon be unable to ask for himself , he became chary of using his influence . 
But in Princess Drubetskaya 's case he felt , after her second appeal , something like qualms of conscience . 
She had reminded him of what was quite true ; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career . 
Moreover , he could see by her manners that she was one of those women -- mostly mothers -- who , having once made up their minds , will not rest until they have gained their end , and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour , and even to make scenes . 
This last consideration moved him . 
`` My dear Anna Mikhaylovna , '' said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone , `` it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask ; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father 's memory , I will do the impossible -- your son shall be transferred to the Guards . 
Here is my hand on it . 
Are you satisfied ? '' 
`` My dear benefactor ! 
This is what I expected from you -- I knew your kindness ! '' 
He turned to go . 
`` Wait -- just a word ! 
When he has been transferred to the Guards ... '' she faltered . 
`` You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov ... recommend Boris to him as adjutant ! 
Then I shall be at rest , and then ... '' Prince Vasili smiled . 
`` No , I wo n't promise that . 
You do n't know how Kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief . 
He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants . '' 
`` No , but do promise ! 
I wo n't let you go ! 
My dear benefactor ... '' `` Papa , '' said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before , `` we shall be late . '' 
`` Well , au revoir ! 
Good-by ! 
You hear her ? '' 
`` Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor ? '' 
`` Certainly ; but about Kutuzov , I do n't promise . '' 
`` Do promise , do promise , Vasili ! '' 
cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went , with the smile of a coquettish girl , which at one time probably came naturally to her , but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face . 
Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts . 
But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold , artificial expression . 
She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking , and again pretended to listen , while waiting till it would be time to leave . 
Her task was accomplished . 
`` And what do you think of this latest comedy , the coronation at Milan ? '' 
asked Anna Pavlovna , `` and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte , and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations ? 
Adorable ! 
It is enough to make one 's head whirl ! 
It is as if the whole world had gone crazy . '' 
Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile . '' 
` Dieu me la donne , gare a qui la touche ! ' 
* They say he was very fine when he said that , '' he remarked , repeating the words in Italian : '' ` Dio mi l'ha dato . 
Guai a chi la tocchi ! ' '' 
* God has given it to me , let him who touches it beware ! 
`` I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over , '' Anna Pavlovna continued . 
`` The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything . '' 
`` The sovereigns ? 
I do not speak of Russia , '' said the vicomte , polite but hopeless : `` The sovereigns , madame ... What have they done for Louis XVII , for the Queen , or for Madame Elizabeth ? 
Nothing ! '' 
and he became more animated . 
`` And believe me , they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause . 
The sovereigns ! 
Why , they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper . '' 
And sighing disdainfully , he again changed his position . 
Prince Hippolyte , who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette , suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess , and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde coat of arms on the table . 
He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it . 
`` Baton de gueules , engrele de gueules d' azur -- maison Conde , '' said he . 
The princess listened , smiling . 
`` If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer , '' the vicomte continued , with the air of a man who , in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else , does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts , `` things will have gone too far . 
By intrigues , violence , exile , and executions , French society -- I mean good French society -- will have been forever destroyed , and then ... '' He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands . 
Pierre wished to make a remark , for the conversation interested him , but Anna Pavlovna , who had him under observation , interrupted : `` The Emperor Alexander , '' said she , with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family , `` has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government ; and I believe that once free from the usurper , the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king , '' she concluded , trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant . 
`` That is doubtful , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far . 
I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime . '' 
`` From what I have heard , '' said Pierre , blushing and breaking into the conversation , `` almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte 's side . '' 
`` It is the Buonapartists who say that , '' replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre . 
`` At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion . '' 
`` Bonaparte has said so , '' remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile . 
It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him , though without looking at him . '' ' 
I showed them the path to glory , but they did not follow it , ' '' Prince Andrew continued after a short silence , again quoting Napoleon 's words . '' ' 
I opened my antechambers and they crowded in . ' 
I do not know how far he was justified in saying so . '' 
`` Not in the least , '' replied the vicomte . 
`` After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero . 
If to some people , '' he went on , turning to Anna Pavlovna , `` he ever was a hero , after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth . '' 
Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte 's epigram , Pierre again broke into the conversation , and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate , she was unable to stop him . 
`` The execution of the Duc d'Enghien , '' declared Monsieur Pierre , `` was a political necessity , and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed . '' 
`` Dieu ! 
Mon Dieu ! ''
