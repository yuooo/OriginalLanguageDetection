`` I am starting on a journey of inspection , and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time , my honored benefactor , '' wrote Prince Vasili . 
`` My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army , so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that , emulating his father , he feels for you . '' 
`` It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out , suitors are coming to us of their own accord , '' incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news . 
Prince Nicholas frowned , but said nothing . 
A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili 's servants came one evening in advance of him , and he and his son arrived next day . 
Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili 's character , but more so recently , since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors . 
And now , from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess , he saw which way the wind was blowing , and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will . 
He snorted whenever he mentioned him . 
On the day of Prince Vasili 's arrival , Prince Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper . 
Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming , or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili 's visit , he was in a bad temper , and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect not to go the prince with his report . 
`` Do you hear how he 's walking ? '' 
said Tikhon , drawing the architect 's attention to the sound of the prince 's footsteps . 
`` Stepping flat on his heels -- we know what that means ... '' However , at nine o'clock the prince , in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap , went out for his usual walk . 
It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse , along which the prince was in the habit of walking , had been swept : the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path . 
The prince went through the conservatories , the serfs ' quarters , and the outbuildings , frowning and silent . 
`` Can a sleigh pass ? '' 
he asked his overseer , a venerable man , resembling his master in manners and looks , who was accompanying him back to the house . 
`` The snow is deep . 
I am having the avenue swept , your honor . '' 
The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch . 
`` God be thanked , '' thought the overseer , `` the storm has blown over ! '' 
`` It would have been hard to drive up , your honor , '' he added . 
`` I heard , your honor , that a minister is coming to visit your honor . '' 
The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him , frowning . 
`` What ? 
A minister ? 
What minister ? 
Who gave orders ? '' 
he said in his shrill , harsh voice . 
`` The road is not swept for the princess my daughter , but for a minister ! 
For me , there are no ministers ! '' 
`` Your honor , I thought ... '' `` You thought ! '' 
shouted the prince , his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly . 
`` You thought ! 
... Rascals ! 
Blackgaurds ! 
... I 'll teach you to think ! '' 
and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit Alpatych , the overseer , had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow . 
`` Thought ... Blackguards ... '' shouted the prince rapidly . 
But although Alpatych , frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke , came up to the prince , bowing his bald head resignedly before him , or perhaps for that very reason , the prince , though he continued to shout : `` Blackgaurds ! 
... Throw the snow back on the road ! '' 
did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house . 
Before dinner , Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne , who knew that the prince was in a bad humor , stood awaiting him ; Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said : `` I know nothing , I am the same as usual , '' and Princess Mary pale , frightened , and with downcast eyes . 
What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne , but could not . 
She thought : `` If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him ; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself , he will say -LRB- as he has done before -RRB- that I 'm in the dumps . '' 
The prince looked at his daughter 's frightened face and snorted . 
`` Fool ... or dummy ! '' 
he muttered . 
`` And the other one is not here . 
They 've been telling tales , '' he thought -- referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room . 
`` Where is the princess ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Hiding ? '' 
`` She is not very well , '' answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright smile , `` so she wo n't come down . 
It is natural in her state . '' 
`` Hm ! 
Hm ! '' 
muttered the prince , sitting down . 
His plate seemed to him not quite clean , and pointing to a spot he flung it away . 
Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman . 
The little princess was not unwell , but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that , hearing he was in a bad humor , she had decided not to appear . 
`` I am afraid for the baby , '' she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne : `` Heaven knows what a fright might do . '' 
In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear , and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling . 
The prince reciprocated this antipathy , but it was overpowered by his contempt for her . 
When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills , she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne , spent whole days with her , asked her to sleep in her room , and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him . 
`` So we are to have visitors , mon prince ? '' 
remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne , unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers . 
`` His Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son , I understand ? '' 
she said inquiringly . 
`` Hm ! 
-- his excellency is a puppy ... . 
I got him his appointment in the service , '' said the prince disdainfully . 
`` Why his son is coming I do n't understand . 
Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know . 
I do n't want him . '' 
-LRB- He looked at his blushing daughter . -RRB- 
`` Are you unwell today ? 
Eh ? 
Afraid of the ` minister ' as that idiot Alpatych called him this morning ? '' 
`` No , mon pere . '' 
Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject , she did not stop talking , but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened , and after the soup the prince became more genial . 
After dinner , he went to see his daughter-in-law . 
The little princess was sitting at a small table , chattering with Masha , her maid . 
She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law . 
She was much altered . 
She was now plain rather than pretty . 
Her cheeks had sunk , her lip was drawn up , and her eyes drawn down . 
`` Yes , I feel a kind of oppression , '' she said in reply to the prince 's question as to how she felt . 
`` Do you want anything ? '' 
`` No , merci , mon pere . '' 
`` Well , all right , all right . '' 
He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with bowed head . 
`` Has the snow been shoveled back ? '' 
`` Yes , your excellency . 
Forgive me for heaven 's sake ... It was only my stupidity . '' 
`` All right , all right , '' interrupted the prince , and laughing his unnatural way , he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss , and then proceeded to his study . 
Prince Vasili arrived that evening . 
He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen , who , with loud shouts , dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow . 
Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them . 
Anatole , having taken off his overcoat , sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes .
