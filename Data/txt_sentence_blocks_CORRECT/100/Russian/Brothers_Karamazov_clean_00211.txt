`` I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall . '' 
On Alyosha 's inquiring whether she had informed the police , she answered that she had told no one , `` but I flew straight to you , I 've run all the way . '' 
She seemed perfectly crazy , Alyosha reported , and was shaking like a leaf . 
When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage , he found Smerdyakov still hanging . 
On the table lay a note : `` I destroy my life of my own will and desire , so as to throw no blame on anyone . '' 
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told him all about it . 
`` And from him I 've come straight to you , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , looking intently into Ivan 's face . 
He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story , as though struck by something in his expression . 
`` Brother , '' he cried suddenly , `` you must be terribly ill . 
You look and do n't seem to understand what I tell you . '' 
`` It 's a good thing you came , '' said Ivan , as though brooding , and not hearing Alyosha 's exclamation . 
`` I knew he had hanged himself . '' 
`` From whom ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
But I knew . 
Did I know ? 
Yes , he told me . 
He told me so just now . '' 
Ivan stood in the middle of the room , and still spoke in the same brooding tone , looking at the ground . 
`` Who is he ? '' 
asked Alyosha , involuntarily looking round . 
`` He 's slipped away . '' 
Ivan raised his head and smiled softly . 
`` He was afraid of you , of a dove like you . 
You are a ` pure cherub . ' 
Dmitri calls you a cherub . 
Cherub ! 
... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim . 
What are seraphim ? 
Perhaps a whole constellation . 
But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule . 
There 's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun . 
Do n't you know it ? '' 
`` Brother , sit down , '' said Alyosha in alarm . 
`` For goodness ' sake , sit down on the sofa ! 
You are delirious ; put your head on the pillow , that 's right . 
Would you like a wet towel on your head ? 
Perhaps it will do you good . '' 
`` Give me the towel : it 's here on the chair . 
I just threw it down there . '' 
`` It 's not here . 
Do n't worry yourself . 
I know where it is - here , '' said Alyosha , finding a clean towel , folded up and unused , by Ivan 's dressing-table in the other corner of the room . 
Ivan looked strangely at the towel : recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant . 
`` Stay '' - he got up from the sofa - `` an hour ago I took that new towel from there and wetted it . 
I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ... How is it it 's dry ? 
There was no other . '' 
`` You put that towel on your head ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Yes , and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles burnt down so ? 
What 's the time ? '' 
`` Nearly twelve '' `` No , no , no ! '' 
Ivan cried suddenly . 
`` It was not a dream . 
He was here ; he was sitting here , on that sofa . 
When you knocked at the window , I threw a glass at him ... this one . 
Wait a minute . 
I was asleep last time , but this dream was not a dream . 
It has happened before . 
I have dreams now , Alyosha ... yet they are not dreams , but reality . 
I walk about , talk and see ... though I am asleep . 
But he was sitting here , on that sofa there ... . 
He is frightfully stupid , Alyosha , frightfully stupid . '' 
Ivan laughed suddenly and began pacing about the room . 
`` Who is stupid ? 
Of whom are you talking , brother ? '' 
Alyosha asked anxiously again . 
`` The devil ! 
He 's taken to visiting me . 
He 's been here twice , almost three times . 
He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not Satan , with scorched wings , in thunder and lightning . 
But he is not Satan : that 's a lie . 
He is an impostor . 
He is simply a devil - a paltry , trivial devil . 
He goes to the baths . 
If you undressed him , you 'd be sure to find he had a tail , long and smooth like a Danish dog 's , a yard long , dun colour ... . 
Alyosha , you are cold . 
You 've been in the snow . 
Would you like some tea ? 
What ? 
Is it cold ? 
Shall I tell her to bring some ? 
C'est a ne pas mettre un chien dehors ... '' Alyosha ran to the washing-stand , wetted the towel , persuaded Ivan to sit down again , and put the wet towel round his head . 
He sat down beside him . 
`` What were you telling me just now about Lise ? '' 
Ivan began again . 
-LRB- He was becoming very talkative . -RRB- 
`` I like Lise . 
I said something nasty about her . 
It was a lie . 
I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow . 
I am more afraid of her than of anything . 
On account of the future . 
She will cast me off to-morrow and trample me under foot . 
She thinks that I am ruining Mitya from jealousy on her account ! 
Yes , she thinks that ! 
But it 's not so . 
To-morrow the cross , but not the gallows . 
No , I sha n't hang myself . 
Do you know , I can never commit suicide , Alyosha .
