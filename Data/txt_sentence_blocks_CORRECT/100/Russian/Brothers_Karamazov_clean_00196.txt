`` I wo n't tire you much . '' 
`` Certainly I can , '' mumbled Smerdyakov , in a faint voice . 
`` Has your honour been back long ? '' 
he added patronisingly , as though encouraging a nervous visitor . 
`` I only arrived to-day ... . 
To see the mess you are in here . '' 
Smerdyakov sighed . 
`` Why do you sigh ? 
You knew of it all along , '' Ivan blurted out . 
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while . 
`` How could I help knowing ? 
It was clear beforehand . 
But how could I tell it would turn out like that ? '' 
`` What would turn out ? 
Do n't prevaricate ! 
You 've foretold you 'd have a fit ; on the way down to the cellar , you know . 
You mentioned the very spot . '' 
`` Have you said so at the examination yet ? '' 
Smerdyakov queried with composure . 
Ivan felt suddenly angry . 
`` No , I have n't yet , but I certainly shall . 
You must explain a great deal to me , my man ; and let me tell you , I am not going to let you play with me ! '' 
`` Why should I play with you , when I put my whole trust in you , as in God Almighty ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with the same composure , only for a moment closing his eyes . 
`` In the first place , '' began Ivan , `` I know that epileptic fits ca n't be told beforehand . 
I 've inquired ; do n't try and take me in . 
You ca n't foretell the day and the hour . 
How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand , and about the cellar , too ? 
How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit , if you did n't sham a fit on purpose ? '' 
`` I had to go to the cellar anyway , several times a day , indeed , '' Smerdyakov drawled deliberately . 
`` I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago . 
It 's quite true you ca n't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand , but you can always have a presentiment of it . '' 
`` But you did foretell the day and the hour ! '' 
`` In regard to my epilepsy , sir , you had much better inquire of the doctors here . 
You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham ; it 's no use my saying any more about it . '' 
`` And the cellar ? 
How could you know beforehand of the cellar ? '' 
`` You do n't seem able to get over that cellar ! 
As I was going down to the cellar , I was in terrible dread and doubt . 
What frightened me most was losing you and being left without defence in all the world . 
So I went down into the cellar thinking , ` Here , it 'll come on directly , it 'll strike me down directly , shall I fall ? ' 
And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying . 
All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before , when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar , I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch , the investigating lawyer , and it 's all been written down in the protocol . 
And the doctor here , Mr. Varvinsky , maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on , the apprehension that I might fall . 
It was just then that the fit seized me . 
And so they 've written it down , that it 's just how it must have happened , simply from my fear . '' 
As he finished , Smerdyakov . 
drew a deep breath , as though exhausted . 
`` Then you have said all that in your evidence ? '' 
said Ivan , somewhat taken aback . 
He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation , and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself . 
`` What have I to be afraid of ? 
Let them write down the whole truth , '' Smerdyakov pronounced firmly . 
`` And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate ? '' 
`` No , not to say every word . '' 
`` And did you tell them that you can sham fits , as you boasted then ? '' 
`` No , I did n't tell them that either . '' 
`` Tell me now , why did you send me then to Tchermashnya ? '' 
`` I was afraid you 'd go away to Moscow ; Tchermashnya is nearer , anyway . '' 
`` You are lying ; you suggested my going away yourself ; you told me to get out of the way of trouble . '' 
`` That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you , foreseeing trouble in the house , to spare you . 
Only I wanted to spare myself even more . 
That 's why I told you to get out of harm 's way , that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house , and would remain at home to protect your father . '' 
`` You might have said it more directly , you blockhead ! '' 
Ivan suddenly fired up . 
`` How could I have said it more directly then ? 
It was simply my fear that made me speak , and you might have been angry , too . 
I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money , for he considered it as good as his own ; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this ? 
I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master 's mattress in the envelope , and you see , he 's murdered him . 
How could you guess it either , sir ? '' 
`` But if you say yourself that it could n't be guessed , how could I have guessed and stayed at home ? 
You contradict yourself ! '' 
said Ivan , pondering . 
`` You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow . '' 
`` How could I guess it from that ? '' 
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted , and again he was silent for a minute . 
`` You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya , that I wanted to have you nearer , for Moscow 's a long way off , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch , knowing you are not far off , would not be so bold . 
And if anything had happened , you might have come to protect me , too , for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch 's illness , and that I was afraid of having a fit . 
And when I explained those knocks to you , by means of which one could go in to the deceased , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me , I thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do something , and so would n't go to Tchermashnya even , but would stay . '' 
`` He talks very coherently , '' thought Ivan , `` though he does mumble ; what 's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of ? '' 
`` You are cunning with me , damn you ! '' 
he exclaimed , getting angry . 
`` But I thought at the time that you quite guessed , '' Smerdyakov parried with the simplest air . 
`` If I 'd guessed , I should have stayed , '' cried Ivan . 
`` Why , I thought that it was because you guessed , that you went away in such a hurry , only to get out of trouble , only to run away and save yourself in your fright . '' 
`` You think that everyone is as great a coward as yourself ? '' 
`` Forgive me , I thought you were like me . '' 
`` Of course , I ought to have guessed , '' Ivan said in agitation ; `` and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying , you are lying again , '' he cried , suddenly recollecting . 
`` Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me , ` It 's always worth while speaking to a clever man ' ? 
So you were glad I went away , since you praised me ? '' 
Smerdyakov sighed again and again . 
A trace of colour came into his face . 
`` If I was pleased , '' he articulated rather breathlessly , `` it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya . 
For it was nearer , anyway . 
Only when I said these words to you , it was not by way of praise , but of reproach . 
You did n't understand it . '' 
`` What reproach ? '' 
`` Why , that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father , and would not protect us , for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand . '' 
`` Damn you ! '' 
Ivan swore again .
