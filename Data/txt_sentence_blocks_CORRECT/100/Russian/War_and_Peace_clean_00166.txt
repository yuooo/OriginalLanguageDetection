Now , do me a service ... . 
What horses have you come with ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` As your messenger ordered , your special beasts , '' replied Balaga . 
`` Well , listen , Balaga ! 
Drive all three to death but get me there in three hours . 
Eh ? '' 
`` When they are dead , what shall I drive ? '' 
said Balaga with a wink . 
`` Mind , I 'll smash your face in ! 
Do n't make jokes ! '' 
cried Anatole , suddenly rolling his eyes . 
`` Why joke ? '' 
said the driver , laughing . 
`` As if I 'd grudge my gentlemen anything ! 
As fast as ever the horses can gallop , so fast we 'll go ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Well , sit down . '' 
`` Yes , sit down ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
`` I 'll stand , Theodore Ivanych . '' 
`` Sit down ; nonsense ! 
Have a drink ! '' 
said Anatole , and filled a large glass of Madeira for him . 
The driver 's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine . 
After refusing it for manners ' sake , he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap . 
`` And when are we to start , your excellency ? '' 
`` Well ... '' Anatole looked at his watch . 
`` We 'll start at once . 
Mind , Balaga ! 
You 'll get there in time ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` That depends on our luck in starting , else why should n't we be there in time ? '' 
replied Balaga . 
`` Did n't we get you to Tver in seven hours ? 
I think you remember that , your excellency ? '' 
`` Do you know , one Christmas I drove from Tver , '' said Anatole , smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed rapturously at him with wide-open eyes . 
`` Will you believe it , Makarka , it took one 's breath away , the rate we flew . 
We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them . 
Eh ? '' 
`` Those were horses ! '' 
Balaga continued the tale . 
`` That time I 'd harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts , '' he went on , turning to Dolokhov . 
`` Will you believe it , Theodore Ivanych , those animals flew forty miles ? 
I could n't hold them in , my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins -- ` Catch hold yourself , your excellency ! ' 
says I , and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there . 
It was n't a case of urging them on , there was no holding them in till we reached the place . 
The devils took us there in three hours ! 
Only the near one died of it . '' 
Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt , and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face . 
Having looked in a mirror , and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it , he lifted a glass of wine . 
`` Well , good-by , Theodore . 
Thank you for everything and farewell ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Well , comrades and friends ... '' he considered for a moment '' ... of my youth , farewell ! '' 
he said , turning to Makarin and the others . 
Though they were all going with him , Anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades . 
He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg . 
`` All take glasses ; you too , Balaga . 
Well , comrades and friends of my youth , we 've had our fling and lived and reveled . 
Eh ? 
And now , when shall we meet again ? 
I am going abroad . 
We have had a good time -- now farewell , lads ! 
To our health ! 
Hurrah ! 
... '' he cried , and emptying his glass flung it on the floor . 
`` To your health ! '' 
said Balaga who also emptied his glass , and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief . 
Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes . 
`` Ah , Prince , how sorry I am to part from you ! 
`` Let 's go . 
Let 's go ! '' 
cried Anatole . 
Balaga was about to leave the room . 
`` No , stop ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Shut the door ; we have first to sit down . 
That 's the way . '' 
They shut the door and all sat down . 
`` Now , quick march , lads ! '' 
said Anatole , rising . 
Joseph , his valet , handed him his sabretache and saber , and they all went out into the vestibule . 
`` And where 's the fur cloak ? '' 
asked Dolokhov . 
`` Hey , Ignatka ! 
Go to Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak . 
I have heard what elopements are like , '' continued Dolokhov with a wink . 
`` Why , she 'll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing ; if you delay at all there 'll be tears and ` Papa ' and ` Mamma , ' and she 's frozen in a minute and must go back -- but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh . '' 
The valet brought a woman 's fox-lined cloak . 
`` Fool , I told you the sable one ! 
Hey , Matrena , the sable ! '' 
he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms . 
A handsome , slim , and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue-black hair , wearing a red shawl , ran out with a sable mantle on her arm . 
`` Here , I do n't grudge it -- take it ! '' 
she said , evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak . 
Dolokhov , without answering , took the cloak , threw it over Matrena , and wrapped her up in it . 
`` That 's the way , '' said Dolokhov , `` and then so ! '' 
and he turned the collar up round her head , leaving only a little of the face uncovered .
