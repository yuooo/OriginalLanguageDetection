`` Have you noticed , Smurov , that in the middle of winter we do n't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now , in the beginning of winter , when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees , especially when there is not much snow . 
It 's because people are not used to it . 
Everything is habit with men , everything even in their social and political relations . 
Habit is the great motive-power . 
What a funny-looking peasant ! '' 
Kolya pointed to a tall peasant , with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat , who was standing by his wagon , clapping together his hands , in their shapeless leather gloves , to warm them . 
His long fair beard was all white with frost . 
`` That peasant 's beard 's frozen , '' Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him . 
`` Lots of people 's beards are frozen , '' the peasant replied , calmly and sententiously . 
`` Do n't provoke him , '' observed Smurov . 
`` It 's all right ; he wo n't be cross ; he 's a nice fellow . 
Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . '' 
`` Is your name Matvey ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Did n't you know ? '' 
`` No , I did n't . 
It was a guess . '' 
`` You do n't say so ! 
You are a schoolboy , I suppose ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You get whipped , I expect ? '' 
`` Nothing to speak of - sometimes . '' 
`` Does it hurt ? '' 
`` Well , yes , it does . '' 
`` Ech , what a life ! '' 
The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his heart . 
`` Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . 
You are a nice chap , that you are . '' 
The boys went on . 
`` That was a nice peasant , '' Kolya observed to Smurov . 
`` I like talking to the peasants , and am always glad to do them justice . '' 
`` Why did you tell a lie , pretending we are thrashed ? '' 
asked Smurov . 
`` I had to say that to please him . '' 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
`` You know , Smurov , I do n't like being asked the same thing twice . 
I like people to understand at the first word . 
Some things ca n't be explained . 
According to a peasant 's notions , schoolboys are whipped , and must be whipped . 
What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped ? 
And if I were to tell him we are not , he 'd be disappointed . 
But you do n't understand that . 
One has to know how to talk to the peasants . '' 
`` Only do n't tease them , please , or you 'll get into another scrape as you did about that goose . '' 
`` So you 're afraid ? '' 
`` Do n't laugh , Kolya . 
Of course I 'm afraid . 
My father would be awfully cross . 
I am strictly forbidden to go out with you . '' 
`` Do n't be uneasy , nothing will happen this time . 
Hallo , Natasha ! '' 
he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths . 
`` Call me Natasha ! 
What next ! 
My name is Marya , '' the middle-aged marketwoman shouted at him . 
`` I am so glad it 's Marya . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` Ah , you young rascal ! 
A brat like you to carry on so ! '' 
`` I 'm in a hurry . 
I ca n't stay now . 
You shall tell me next Sunday . '' 
Kolya waved his hand at her , as though she had attacked him and not he her . 
`` I 've nothing to tell you next Sunday . 
You set upon me , you impudent young monkey . 
I did n't say anything , '' bawled Marya . 
`` You want a whipping , that 's what you want , you saucy jackanapes ! '' 
There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her . 
Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by . 
He was a young man , not a native of the town , with dark , curly hair and a long , pale face , marked with smallpox . 
He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap , and looked like a merchant 's clerk . 
He was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya . 
`` I know you ! '' 
he cried angrily , `` I know you ! '' 
Kolya stared at him . 
He could not recall when he could have had a row with the man . 
But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all . 
`` Do you ? '' 
he asked sarcastically . 
`` I know you ! 
I know you ! '' 
the man repeated idiotically . 
So much the better for you . 
Well , it 's time I was going . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? '' 
cried the man . 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? 
I know , you are at it again ! '' 
`` It 's not your business , brother , if I am at my saucy pranks again , '' said Kolya , standing still and scanning him . 
`` Not my business ? '' 
`` No ; it 's not your business . '' 
`` Whose then ? 
Whose then ? 
Whose then ? '' 
`` It 's Trifon Nikititch 's business , not yours . '' 
`` What Trifon Nikititch ? '' 
asked the youth , staring with loutish amazement at Kolya , but still as angry as ever .
