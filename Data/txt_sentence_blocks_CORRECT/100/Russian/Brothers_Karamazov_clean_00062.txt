About my ` wisp of tow , ' then ? '' 
He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against Alyosha . 
His lips were strangely compressed like a thread . 
`` What wisp of tow ? '' 
muttered Alyosha . 
`` He is come to complain of me , father ! '' 
cried a voice familiar to Alyosha - the voice of the schoolboy - from behind the curtain . 
`` I bit his finger just now . '' 
The curtain was pulled , and Alyosha saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner under the ikons . 
The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt . 
He was evidently unwell , and , judging by his glittering eyes , he was in a fever . 
He looked at Alyosha without fear , as though he felt he was at home and could not be touched . 
`` What ! 
Did he bite your finger ? '' 
The captain jumped up from his chair . 
`` Was it your finger he bit ? '' 
`` Yes . 
He was throwing stones with other schoolboys . 
There were six of them against him alone . 
I went up to him , and he threw a stone at me and then another at my head . 
I asked him what I had done to him . 
And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly , I do n't know why . '' 
`` I 'll thrash him , sir , at once - this minute ! '' 
The captain jumped up from his seat . 
`` But I am not complaining at all , I am simply telling you ... . 
I do n't want him to be thrashed . 
Besides , he seems to be ill . '' 
`` And do you suppose I 'd thrash him ? 
That I 'd take my Ilusha and thrash him before you for your satisfaction ? 
Would you like it done at once , sir ? '' 
said the captain , suddenly turning to Alyosha , as though he were going to attack him . 
`` I am sorry about your finger , sir ; but instead of thrashing Ilusha , would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath ? 
I should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance . 
You wo n't ask for the fifth one too ? '' 
He stopped short with a catch in his throat . 
Every feature in his face was twitching and working ; he looked extremely defiant . 
He was in a sort of frenzy . 
`` I think I understand it all now , '' said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully , still keeping his seat . 
`` So your boy is a good boy , he loves his father , and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant ... . 
Now I understand it , '' he repeated thoughtfully . 
`` But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action , I know that , and if only it is possible for him to come to you , or better still , to meet you in that same place , he will ask your forgiveness before everyone - if you wish it . '' 
`` After pulling out my beard , you mean , he will ask my forgiveness ? 
And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish , does n't he ? '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
On the contrary , he will do anything you like and in any way you like . '' 
`` So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in that very tavern - ` The Metropolis ' it 's called - or in the marketplace , he would do it ? '' 
`` Yes , he would even go down on his knees . '' 
`` You 've pierced me to the heart , sir . 
Touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart ! 
I am only too sensible of your brother 's generosity . 
Allow me to introduce my family , my two daughters and my son - my litter . 
If I die , who will care for them , and while I live who but they will care for a wretch like me ? 
That 's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort , sir . 
For there must be someone able to love even a man like me . '' 
`` Ah , that 's perfectly true ! '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` Oh , do leave off playing the fool ! 
Some idiot comes in , and you put us to shame ! '' 
cried the girl by the window , suddenly turning to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air . 
`` Wait a little , Varvara ! '' 
cried her father , speaking peremptorily but looking at them quite approvingly . 
`` That 's her character , '' he said , addressing Alyosha again . 
`` And in all nature there was naught That could find favour in his eyes - or rather in the feminine - that could find favour in her eyes - . 
But now let me present you to my wife , Arina Petrovna . 
She is crippled , she is forty-three ; she can move , but very little . 
She is of humble origin . 
Arina Petrovna , compose your countenance . 
This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
Get up , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
He took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him up . 
`` You must stand up to be introduced to a lady . 
It 's not the Karamazov , mamma , who ... h 'm ... etcetera , but his brother , radiant with modest virtues . 
Come , Arina Petrovna , come , mamma , first your hand to be kissed . '' 
And he kissed his wife 's hand respectfully and even tenderly . 
The girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene ; an expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the woman . 
`` Good morning ! 
Sit down , Mr. Tchernomazov , '' she said . 
`` Karamazov , mamma , Karamazov . 
We are of humble origin , '' he whispered again . 
`` Well , Karamazov , or whatever it is , but I always think of Tchermomazov ... . 
Sit down . 
Why has he pulled you up ? 
He calls me crippled , but I am not , only my legs are swollen like barrels , and I am shrivelled up myself . 
Once I used to be so fat , but now it 's as though I had swallowed a needle . '' 
`` We are of humble origin , '' the captain muttered again . 
`` Oh , father , father ! '' 
the hunchback girl , who had till then been silent on her chair , said suddenly , and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief . 
`` Buffoon ! '' 
blurted out the girl at the window . 
`` Have you heard our news ? '' 
said the mother , pointing at her daughters . 
`` It 's like clouds coming over ; the clouds pass and we have music again . 
When we were with the army , we used to have many such guests . 
I do n't mean to make any comparisons ; everyone to their taste . 
The deacon 's wife used to come then and say , ` Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart , but Nastasya Petrovna , ' she would say , ` is of the brood of hell . ' 
` Well , ' I said , ` that 's a matter of taste ; but you are a little spitfire . ' 
` And you want keeping in your place ; ' says she . 
` You black sword , ' said I , ` who asked you to teach me ? ' 
` But my breath , ' says she , ` is clean , and yours is unclean . ' 
` You ask all the officers whether my breath is unclean . '
