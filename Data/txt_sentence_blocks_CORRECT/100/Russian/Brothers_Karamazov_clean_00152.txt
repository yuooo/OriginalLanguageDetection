`` We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet examined . 
Do n't be anxious about your money . 
It will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning ... if it appears , or , so to speak , is proved that you have undisputed right to it . 
Well , and now ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up , and informed Mitya firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search `` of your clothes and everything else ... '' `` By all means , gentlemen . 
I 'll turn out all my pockets , if you like . '' 
And he did , in fact , begin turning out his pockets . 
`` It will be necessary to take off your clothes , too . '' 
`` What ! 
Undress ? 
Ugh ! 
Damn it ! 
Wo n't you search me as I am ? 
Ca n't you ? '' 
`` It 's utterly impossible , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You must take off your clothes . '' 
`` As you like , '' Mitya submitted gloomily ; `` only , please , not here , but behind the curtains . 
Who will search them ? '' 
`` Behind the curtains , of course . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent . 
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity . 
The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny . 
`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya . 
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers . 
There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes . 
`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? '' 
`` Yes , '' Mitya jerked out . 
`` That is , what blood ? 
... and why is the cuff turned in ? '' 
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory , and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin 's . 
`` You must take off your shirt , too . 
That 's very important as material evidence . '' 
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage . 
`` What , am I to stay naked ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Do n't disturb yourself . 
We will arrange something . 
And meanwhile take off your socks . '' 
`` You 're not joking ? 
Is that really necessary ? '' 
Mitya 's eyes flashed . 
`` We are in no mood for joking , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly . 
`` Well , if I must - '' muttered Mitya , and sitting down on the bed , he took off his socks . 
He felt unbearably awkward . 
All were clothed , while he was naked , and strange to say , when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence , and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them , and that now they had a perfect right to despise him . 
`` When all are undressed , one is somehow not ashamed , but when one 's the only one undressed and everybody is looking , it 's degrading , '' he kept repeating to himself , again and again . 
`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . '' 
`` Well , am I to stay naked like this ? '' 
he added savagely . 
`` Yes , that ca n't be helped for the time ... . 
Kindly sit down here for a while . 
You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed , and I. . . 
I 'll see to all this . '' 
All the things were shown to the witnesses . 
The report of the search was drawn up , and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out , and the clothes were carried out after him . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out , too . 
Mitya was left alone with the peasants , who stood in silence , never taking their eyes off him . 
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt .
