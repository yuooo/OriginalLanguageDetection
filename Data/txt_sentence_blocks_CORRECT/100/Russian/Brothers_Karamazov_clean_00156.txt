It 's absurd to ask . 
Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning , here , at dawn . 
I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honour . 
But I see it 's not so , it turns out that it does make a difference . 
Believe me , gentlemen , what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I 'd killed the old servant , and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded , and Heaven was open to me again . 
Oh , that did torture me , but not in the same way ; not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it , and had become a downright thief ! 
Oh , gentlemen , I tell you again , with a bleeding heart , I have learnt a great deal this night . 
I have learnt that it 's not only impossible to live a scoundrel , but impossible to die a scoundrel ... . 
No , gentlemen , one must die honest ... '' Mitya was pale . 
His face had a haggard and exhausted look , in spite of his being intensely excited . 
`` I am beginning to understand you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor said slowly , a soft and almost compassionate tone . 
`` But all this , if you 'll excuse my saying so , is a matter of nerves , in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves , that 's what it is . 
And why , for instance , should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month , by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you ? 
And why could you not have explained things to her , and in view of your position , which you describe as being so awful , why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one 's mind , that is , after honourably confessing your errors to her , why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses , which , with her generous heart , she would certainly not have refused you in your distress , especially if it had been with some guarantee , or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov , and to Madame Hohlakov ? 
I suppose you still regard that security as of value ? '' 
Mitya suddenly crimsoned . 
`` Surely you do n't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that ? 
You ca n't be speaking in earnest ? '' 
he said , with indignation , looking the prosecutor straight in the face , and seeming unable to believe his ears . 
`` I assure you I 'm in earnest ... Why do you imagine I 'm not serious ? '' 
It was the prosecutor 's turn to be surprised . 
`` Oh , how base that would have been ! 
Gentlemen , do you know , you are torturing me ! 
Let me tell you everything , so be it . 
I 'll confess all my infernal wickedness , but to put you to shame , and you 'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink . 
You must know that I already had that plan myself , that plan you spoke of , just now , prosecutor ! 
Yes , gentlemen , I , too , have had that thought in my mind all this current month , so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya - I was mean enough for that . 
But to go to her , to tell her of my treachery , and for that very treachery , to carry it out , for the expenses of that treachery , to beg for money from her , Katya -LRB- to beg , do you hear , to beg -RRB- , and go straight from her to run away with the other , the rival , who hated and insulted her - to think of it ! 
You must be mad , prosecutor ! '' 
`` Mad I am not , but I did speak in haste , without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case , as you assert ... yes , perhaps there is something of the kind , '' said the prosecutor , smiling . 
`` But that would have been so infamous ! '' 
Mitya brought his fist down on the table fiercely . 
`` That would have been filthy beyond everything ! 
Yes , do you know that she might have given me that money , yes , and she would have given it , too ; she 'd have been certain to give it , to be revenged on me , she 'd have given it to satisfy her vengeance , to show her contempt for me , for hers is an infernal nature , too , and she 's a woman of great wrath . 
I 'd have taken the money , too , oh , I should have taken it ; I should have taken it , and then , for the rest of my life ... oh , God ! 
Forgive me , gentlemen , I 'm making such an outcry because I 've had that thought in my mind so lately , only the day before yesterday , that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy , and afterwards yesterday , all day yesterday , I remember , till that happened ... '' `` Till what happened ? '' 
put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively , but Mitya did not hear it . 
`` I have made you an awful confession , '' Mitya said gloomily in conclusion . 
`` You must appreciate it , and what 's more , you must respect it , for if not , if that leaves your souls untouched , then you 've simply no respect for me , gentlemen , I tell you that , and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you ! 
Oh , I shall shoot myself ! 
Yes , I see , I see already that you do n't believe me . 
What , you want to write that down , too ? '' 
he cried in dismay . 
`` Yes , what you said just now , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , looking at him surprise , `` that is , that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her ... . 
I assure you , that 's a very important piece of evidence for us , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you , particularly important for you . '' 
`` Have mercy , gentlemen ! '' 
Mitya flung up his hands . 
`` Do n't write that , anyway ; have some shame . 
Here I 've torn my heart asunder before you , and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves ... . 
Oh , my God ! '' 
In despair he hid his face in his hands . 
`` Do n't worry yourself so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' observed the prosecutor , `` everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards , and what you do n't agree to we 'll alter as you like . 
But now I 'll ask you one little question for the second time . 
Has no one , absolutely no one , heard from you of that money you sewed up ? 
That , I must tell you , is almost impossible to believe . '' 
`` No one , no one , I told you so before , or you 've not understood anything ! 
Let me alone ! '' 
`` Very well , this matter is bound to be explained , and there 's plenty of time for it , but meantime , consider ; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad , and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you 'd spent here ; three thousand , not fifteen hundred . 
And now , too , when you got hold of the money you had yesterday , you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you . '' 
`` You 've got not dozens , but hundreds of witnesses , two hundred witnesses , two hundred have heard it , thousands have heard it ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Well , you see , all bear witness to it . 
And the word all means something . '' 
`` It means nothing . 
I talked rot , and everyone began repeating it . '' 
`` But what need had you to ` talk rot , ' as you call it ? '' 
`` The devil knows . 
From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money ... . 
To try and forget that money I had sewn up , perhaps ... yes , that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question ? 
Well , I told a fib , and that was the end of it ; once I 'd said it , I did n't care to correct it . 
What does a man tell lies for sometimes ? '' 
`` That 's very difficult to decide , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what makes a man tell lies , '' observed the prosecutor impressively . 
`` Tell me , though , was that ` amulet , ' as you call it , on your neck , a big thing ? '' 
`` No , not big . '' 
`` How big , for instance ? '' 
`` If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half , that would be the size . '' 
`` You 'd better show us the remains of it . 
You must have them somewhere . '' 
`` Damnation , what nonsense ! 
I do n't know where they are . '' 
`` But excuse me : where and when did you take it off your neck ? 
According to your own evidence you did n't go home . '' 
`` When I was going from Fenya 's to Perhotin 's , on the way I tore it off my neck and took out the money . '' 
`` In the dark ? '' 
`` What should I want a light for ? 
I did it with my fingers in one minute . '' 
`` Without scissors , in the street ? '' 
`` In the market-place I think it was . 
Why scissors ? 
It was an old rag . 
It was torn in a minute . '' 
`` Where did you put it afterwards ? '' 
`` I dropped it there . '' 
`` Where was it , exactly ? '' 
`` In the market-place , in the market-place ! 
The devil knows whereabouts . 
What do you want to know for ? '' 
`` That 's extremely important , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
It would be material evidence in your favour . 
How is it you do n't understand that ?
