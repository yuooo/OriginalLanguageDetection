That must be true . 
Really he is quite unlike him -- in everything . '' 
`` Yes , but he 's wonderful . '' 
`` Well , good night , '' said Natasha . 
And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there . 
It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night . 
He paced up and down his room , now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning , now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing , and now smiling happily . 
He was thinking of Prince Andrew , of Natasha , and of their love , at one moment jealous of her past , then reproaching himself for that feeling . 
It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room . 
`` Well , what 's to be done if it can not be avoided ? 
What 's to be done ? 
Evidently it has to be so , '' said he to himself , and hastily undressing he got into bed , happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision . 
`` Strange and impossible as such happiness seems , I must do everything that she and I may be man and wife , '' he told himself . 
A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the Friday . 
When he awoke on the Thursday , Savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey . 
`` What , to Petersburg ? 
What is Petersburg ? 
Who is there in Petersburg ? '' 
he asked involuntarily , though only to himself . 
`` Oh , yes , long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg , '' he reflected . 
`` Why ? 
But perhaps I shall go . 
What a good fellow he is and how attentive , and how he remembers everything , '' he thought , looking at Savelich 's old face , `` and what a pleasant smile he has ! '' 
`` Well , Savelich , do you still not wish to accept your freedom ? '' 
Pierre asked him . 
`` What 's the good of freedom to me , your excellency ? 
We lived under the late count -- the kingdom of heaven be his ! 
-- and we have lived under you too , without ever being wronged . '' 
`` And your children ? '' 
`` The children will live just the same . 
With such masters one can live . '' 
`` But what about my heirs ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` Supposing I suddenly marry ... it might happen , '' he added with an involuntary smile . 
`` If I may take the liberty , your excellency , it would be a good thing . '' 
`` How easy he thinks it , '' thought Pierre . 
`` He does n't know how terrible it is and how dangerous . 
Too soon or too late ... it is terrible ! '' 
`` So what are your orders ? 
Are you starting tomorrow ? '' 
asked Savelich . 
`` No , I 'll put it off for a bit . 
I 'll tell you later . 
You must forgive the trouble I have put you to , '' said Pierre , and seeing Savelich smile , he thought : `` But how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no Petersburg for me , and that that must be settled first of all ! 
But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending . 
Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks ? '' 
Pierre reflected . 
`` No , another time . '' 
At breakfast Pierre told the princess , his cousin , that he had been to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met -- `` Whom do you think ? 
Natasha Rostova ! '' 
The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen Anna Semenovna . 
`` Do you know her ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` I have seen the princess , '' she replied . 
`` I heard that they were arranging a match for her with young Rostov . 
It would be a very good thing for the Rostovs , they are said to be utterly ruined . '' 
`` No ; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova ? '' 
`` I heard about that affair of hers at the time . 
It was a great pity . '' 
`` No , she either does n't understand or is pretending , '' thought Pierre . 
`` Better not say anything to her either . '' 
The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre 's journey . 
`` How kind they all are , '' thought Pierre . 
`` What is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them . 
And all for me ! '' 
On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre , inviting him to send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day . 
`` And this man too , '' thought Pierre , looking into the face of the Chief of Police . 
`` What a fine , good-looking officer and how kind . 
Fancy bothering about such trifies now ! 
And they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes . 
What nonsense ! 
Besides , why should n't he take bribes ? 
That 's the way he was brought up , and everybody does it . 
But what a kind , pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me . '' 
Pierre went to Princess Mary 's to dinner . 
As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down , he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins . 
The picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of the town , stretching out and concealing one another , reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum . 
The cabmen he met and their passengers , the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes , the women hawkers , and the shopkeepers , all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say : `` Ah , there he is ! 
Let 's see what will come of it ! '' 
At the entrance to Princess Mary 's house Pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen Natasha and talked to her . 
`` Perhaps I imagined it ; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there . '' 
But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom . 
She was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before , yet she was quite different . 
Had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her . 
She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince Andrew 's fiancee . 
A bright questioning light shone in her eyes , and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression . 
Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there , but Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her . 
Next day he came early , dined , and stayed the whole evening . 
Though Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all Pierre 's interest was now centered in that house , by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off . 
He stayed so long that Princess Mary and Natasha exchanged glances , evidently wondering when he would go . 
Pierre noticed this but could not go . 
He felt uneasy and embarrassed , but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave . 
Princess Mary , foreseeing no end to this , rose first , and complaining of a headache began to say good night . 
`` So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow ? '' 
she asked . 
`` No , I am not going , '' Pierre replied hastily , in a surprised tone and as though offended . 
`` Yes ... no ... to Petersburg ? 
Tomorrow -- but I wo n't say good-by yet . 
I will call round in case you have any commissions for me , '' said he , standing before Princess Mary and turning red , but not taking his departure . 
Natasha gave him her hand and went out .
