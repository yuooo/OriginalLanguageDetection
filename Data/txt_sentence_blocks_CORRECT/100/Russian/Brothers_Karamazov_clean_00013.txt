What for ? '' 
Alyosha muttered in great astonishment . 
His face at once looked anxious . 
`` Oh , it 's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and - what has happened lately , '' the mother explained hurriedly . 
`` Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind , but she must see you about it ... . 
Why , of course , I ca n't say . 
But she wants to see you at once . 
And you will go to her , of course . 
It is a Christian duty . '' 
`` I have only seen her once , '' Alyosha protested with the same perplexity . 
`` Oh , she is such a lofty , incomparable creature If only for her suffering ... . 
Think what she has gone through , what she is enduring now Think what awaits her ! 
It 's all terrible , terrible ! 
`` Very well , I will come , '' Alyosha decided , after rapidly scanning the brief , enigmatic note , which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would come , without any sort of explanation . 
`` Oh , how sweet and generous that would be of you '' cried Lise with sudden animation . 
`` I told mamma you 'd be sure not to go . 
I said you were saving your soul . 
How splendid you are I 've always thought you were splendid . 
How glad I am to tell you so ! '' 
`` Lise ! '' 
said her mother impressively , though she smiled after she had said it . 
`` You have quite forgotten us , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said ; `` you never come to see us . 
Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except with you . '' 
Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed , and again smiled without knowing why . 
But the elder was no longer watching him . 
He had begun talking to a monk who , as mentioned before , had been awaiting his entrance by Lise 's chair . 
He was evidently a monk of the humblest , that is of the peasant , class , of a narrow outlook , but a true believer , and , in his own way , a stubborn one . 
He announced that he had come from the far north , from Obdorsk , from Saint Sylvester , and was a member of a poor monastery , consisting of only ten monks . 
The elder gave him his blessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked . 
`` How can you presume to do such deeds ? '' 
the monk asked suddenly , pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise . 
He was referring to her `` healing . '' 
`` It 's too early , of course , to speak of that . 
Relief is not complete cure , and may proceed from different causes . 
But if there has been any healing , it is by no power but God 's will . 
It 's all from God . 
Visit me , Father , '' he added to the monk . 
`` It 's not often I can see visitors . 
I am ill , and I know that my days are numbered . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
God will not take you from us . 
You will live a long , long time yet , '' cried the lady . 
`` And in what way are you ill ? 
You look so well , so gay and happy . '' 
`` I am extraordinarily better to-day . 
But I know that it 's only for a moment . 
I understand my disease now thoroughly . 
If I seem so happy to you , you could never say anything that would please me so much . 
For men are made for happiness , and anyone who is completely happy has a right to say to himself , ' I am doing God 's will on earth . ' 
All the righteous , all the saints , all the holy martyrs were happy . '' 
`` Oh , how you speak ! 
What bold and lofty words '' cried the lady . 
`` You seem to pierce with your words . 
And yet - happiness , happiness - where is it ? 
Who can say of himself that he is happy ? 
Oh , since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day , let me tell you what I could not utter last time , what I dared not say , all I am suffering and have been for so long ! 
I am suffering ! 
Forgive me ! 
I am suffering ! '' 
And in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him . 
`` From what specially ? '' 
`` I suffer ... from lack of faith . '' 
`` Lack of faith in God ? '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I dare not even think of that . 
But the future life - it is such an enigma And no one , no one can solve it . 
Listen ! 
You are a healer , you are deeply versed in the human soul , and of course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely , but I assure you on my word of honour that I am not speaking lightly now . 
The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish , to terror . 
And I do n't know to whom to appeal , and have not dared to all my life . 
And now I am so bold as to ask you . 
Oh , God ! 
What will you think of me now ? '' 
She clasped her hands . 
`` Do n't distress yourself about my opinion of you , '' said the elder . 
`` I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering . '' 
`` Oh , how thankful I am to you ! 
You see , I shut my eyes and ask myself if everyone has faith , where did it come from ? 
And then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature , and that none of it 's real . 
And I say to myself , ` What if I 've been believing all my life , and when I come to die there 's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave ? ' 
as I read in some author . 
It 's awful ! 
How - how can I get back my faith ? 
But I only believed when I was a little child , mechanically , without thinking of anything . 
How , how is one to prove it ? 
have come now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it . 
If I let this chance slip , no one all my life will answer me . 
How can I prove it ? 
How can I convince myself ? 
Oh , how unhappy I am ! 
I stand and look about me and see that scarcely anyone else cares ; no one troubles his head about it , and I 'm the only one who ca n't stand it . 
It 's deadly - deadly ! '' 
`` No doubt . 
But there 's no proving it , though you can be convinced of it . '' 
`` By the experience of active love . 
Strive to love your neighbour actively and indefatigably . 
In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul . 
If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbour , then you will believe without doubt , and no doubt can possibly enter your soul . 
This has been tried . 
This is certain . ''
