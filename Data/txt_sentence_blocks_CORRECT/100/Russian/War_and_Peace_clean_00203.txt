`` Well , is she pretty ? 
Ah , friend -- my pink one is delicious ; her name is Dunyasha ... '' But on glancing at Rostov 's face Ilyin stopped short . 
He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought . 
Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village . 
`` I 'll show them ; I 'll give it to them , the brigands ! '' 
said he to himself . 
Alpatych at a gliding trot , only just managing not to run , kept up with him with difficulty . 
`` What decision have you been pleased to come to ? '' 
said he . 
Rostov stopped and , clenching his fists , suddenly and sternly turned on Alpatych . 
`` Decision ? 
What decision ? 
Old dotard ! 
... '' cried he . 
`` What have you been about ? 
Eh ? 
The peasants are rioting , and you ca n't manage them ? 
You 're a traitor yourself ! 
I know you . 
I 'll flay you all alive ! 
... '' And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger , he left Alpatych and went rapidly forward . 
Alpatych , mastering his offended feelings , kept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views . 
He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to `` overresist '' them without an armed force , and would it not be better first to send for the military ? 
`` I 'll give them armed force ... I 'll ` overresist ' them ! '' 
uttered Rostov meaninglessly , breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it . 
Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick , resolute steps toward the crowd . 
And the nearer he drew to it the more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results . 
The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rostov 's rapid , firm steps and resolute , frowning face . 
After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see the princess , a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd . 
Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained . 
Dron was of this opinion , but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder . 
`` How many years have you been fattening on the commune ? '' 
Karp shouted at him . 
`` It 's all one to you ! 
You 'll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you ... . 
What does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not ? '' 
`` We 've been told to keep order , and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain , and that 's all about it ! '' 
cried another . 
`` It was your son 's turn to be conscripted , but no fear ! 
You begrudged your lump of a son , '' a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron -- `` and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier ! 
But we all have to die . '' 
`` To be sure , we all have to die . 
I 'm not against the commune , '' said Dron . 
`` That 's it -- not against it ! 
You 've filled your belly ... '' The two tall peasants had their say . 
As soon as Rostov , followed by Ilyin , Lavrushka , and Alpatych , came up to the crowd , Karp , thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little , walked to the front . 
Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together . 
`` Who is your Elder here ? 
Hey ? '' 
shouted Rostov , coming up to the crowd with quick steps . 
`` The Elder ? 
What do you want with him ? 
... '' asked Karp . 
But before the words were well out of his mouth , his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side . 
`` Caps off , traitors ! '' 
shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
he cried furiously . 
`` The Elder ... . 
He wants the Elder ! 
... Dron Zakharych , you ! '' 
meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads . 
`` We do n't riot , we 're following the orders , '' declared Karp , and at that moment several voices began speaking together . 
`` It 's as the old men have decided -- there 's too many of you giving orders . '' 
`` Arguing ? 
Mutiny ! 
... Brigands ! 
Traitors ! '' 
cried Rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own , gripping Karp by the collar . 
`` Bind him , bind him ! '' 
he shouted , though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych . 
Lavrushka , however , ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind . 
`` Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill ? '' 
he called out . 
Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp . 
The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
demanded Rostov in a loud voice . 
With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd . 
`` Are you the Elder ? 
Bind him , Lavrushka ! '' 
shouted Rostov , as if that order , too , could not possibly meet with any opposition . 
And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron , who took off his own belt and handed it to them , as if to aid them . 
`` And you all listen to me ! '' 
said Rostov to the peasants . 
`` Be off to your houses at once , and do n't let one of your voices be heard ! '' 
`` Why , we 've not done any harm ! 
We did it just out of foolishness . 
It 's all nonsense ... I said then that it was not in order , '' voices were heard bickering with one another . 
`` There ! 
What did I say ? '' 
said Alpatych , coming into his own again . 
`` It 's wrong , lads ! '' 
`` All our stupidity , Yakov Alpatych , '' came the answers , and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village . 
The two bound men were led off to the master 's house . 
The two drunken peasants followed them . 
`` Aye , when I look at you ! 
... '' said one of them to Karp . 
`` How can one talk to the masters like that ? 
What were you thinking of , you fool ? ''
