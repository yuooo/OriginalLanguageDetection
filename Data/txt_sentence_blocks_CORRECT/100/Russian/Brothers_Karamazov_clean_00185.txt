Ah , what silliness ! 
And how bored I am ! '' 
She waved her hand with a look of repulsion . 
`` It 's your luxurious life , '' said Alyosha , softly '' `` Is it better , then , to be poor ? '' 
`` Yes , it is better . '' 
`` That 's what your monk taught you . 
That 's not true . 
Let me be rich and all the rest poor , I 'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to anyone else . 
Ach , do n't speak , do n't say anything '' ; she shook her hand at him , though Alyosha had not opened his mouth . 
`` You 've told me all that before , I know it all by heart . 
It bores me . 
If I am ever poor , I shall murder somebody , and even if I am rich , I may murder someone , perhaps - why do nothing ! 
But do you know , I should like to reap , cut the rye ? 
I 'll marry you , and you shall become a peasant , a real peasant ; we 'll keep a colt , shall we ? 
Do you know Kalganov ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` He is always wandering about , dreaming . 
He says , ` Why live in real life ? 
It 's better to dream . 
One can dream the most delightful things , but real life is a bore . ' 
But he 'll be married soon for all that ; he 's been making love to me already . 
Can you spin tops ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , he 's just like a top : he wants to be wound up and set spinning and then to be lashed , lashed , lashed with a whip . 
If I marry him , I 'll keep him spinning all his life . 
You are not ashamed to be with me ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` You are awfully cross , because I do n't talk about holy things . 
I do n't want to be holy . 
What will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin ? 
You must know all about that . '' 
`` God will censure you . '' 
Alyosha was watching her steadily . 
`` That 's just what I should like . 
I would go up and they would censure me , and I would burst out laughing in their faces . 
I should dreadfully like to set fire to the house , Alyosha , to our house ; you still do n't believe me ? '' 
`` Why ? 
There are children of twelve years old , who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire , too . 
It 's a sort of disease . '' 
`` That 's not true , that 's not true ; there may be children , but that 's not what I mean . '' 
`` You take evil for good ; it 's a passing crisis ; it 's the result of your illness , perhaps . '' 
`` You do despise me , though ! 
It 's simply that I do n't want to do good , I want to do evil , and it has nothing to do with illness . '' 
`` Why do evil ? '' 
`` So that everything might be destroyed . 
Ah , how nice it would be if everything were destroyed ! 
You know , Alyosha , I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad , and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it out . 
Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all . 
That would be awfully nice . 
Why would it be so nice , Alyosha ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
It 's a craving to destroy something good or , as you say , to set fire to something . 
It happens sometimes . '' 
`` I not only say it , I shall do it . '' 
`` I believe you . '' 
`` Ah , how I love you for saying you believe me . 
And you are not lying one little bit . 
But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to annoy you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it , too . '' 
`` There is a little . 
I never can tell lies to you , '' she declared , with a strange fire in her eyes . 
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness . 
There was not a trace of humour or jesting in her face now , though , in old days , fun and gaiety never deserted her even at her most `` earnest '' moments . 
`` There are moments when people love crime , '' said Alyosha thoughtfully . 
`` Yes , yes ! 
You have uttered my thought ; they love crime , everyone loves crime , they love it always , not at some ` moments . ' 
You know , it 's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since . 
They all declare that they hate evil , but secretly they all love it . '' 
`` And are you still reading nasty books ? '' 
`` Yes , I am . 
Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal them . '' 
`` Are n't you ashamed to destroy yourself ? '' 
`` I want to destroy myself . 
There 's a boy here , who lay down between the railway lines when the train was passing . 
Lucky fellow ! 
Listen , your brother is being tried now for murdering his father and everyone loves his having killed his father . '' 
`` Loves his having killed his father ? '' 
`` Yes , loves it ; everyone loves it ! 
Everybody says it 's so awful , but secretly they simply love it . 
I for one love it . '' 
`` There is some truth in what you say about everyone , '' said Alyosha softly . 
`` Oh , what ideas you have ! '' 
Lise shrieked in delight . 
`` And you a monk , too ! 
You would n't believe how I respect you , Alyosha , for never telling lies . 
Oh , I must tell you a funny dream of mine . 
I sometimes dream of devils . 
It 's night ; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place , in all the corners , under the table , and they open the doors ; there 's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me . 
And they are just coming , just seizing me . 
But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back , though they do n't go away altogether , they stand at the doors and in the corners , waiting . 
And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud , and so I begin , and then they come crowding back to me , delighted , and seize me again and I cross myself again and they all draw back . 
It 's awful fun , it takes one 's breath away . '' 
`` I 've had the same dream , too , '' said Alyosha suddenly . 
`` Really ? '' 
cried Lise , surprised . 
`` I say , Alyosha , do n't laugh , that 's awfully important . 
Could two different people have the same dream ? '' 
`` It seems they can . '' 
`` Alyosha , I tell you , it 's awfully important , '' Lise went on , with really excessive amazement . 
`` It 's not the dream that 's important , but your having the same dream as me .
