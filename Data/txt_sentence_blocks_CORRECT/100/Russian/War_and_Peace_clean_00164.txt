Natasha , how glad I am you 're not angry with me ! 
Tell me everything -- the whole truth . 
What did he say ? '' 
Natasha became thoughtful . 
`` Oh , Sonya , if you knew him as I do ! 
He said ... He asked me what I had promised Bolkonski . 
He was glad I was free to refuse him . '' 
Sonya sighed sorrowfully . 
`` But you have n't refused Bolkonski ? '' 
said she . 
`` Perhaps I have . 
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski . 
Why do you think so badly of me ? '' 
`` I do n't think anything , only I do n't understand this ... '' `` Wait a bit , Sonya , you 'll understand everything . 
You 'll see what a man he is ! 
Now do n't think badly of me or of him . 
I do n't think badly of anyone : I love and pity everybody . 
But what am I to do ? '' 
Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her . 
The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha 's face became , the more serious and stern grew Sonya 's . 
`` Natasha , '' said she , `` you asked me not to speak to you , and I have n't spoken , but now you yourself have begun . 
I do n't trust him , Natasha . 
Why this secrecy ? '' 
`` Again , again ! '' 
interrupted Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I am afraid for you ! '' 
`` Afraid of what ? '' 
`` I am afraid you 're going to your ruin , '' said Sonya resolutely , and was herself horrified at what she had said . 
Anger again showed in Natasha 's face . 
`` And I 'll go to my ruin , I will , as soon as possible ! 
It 's not your business ! 
It wo n't be you , but I , who 'll suffer . 
Leave me alone , leave me alone ! 
I hate you ! '' 
`` Natasha ! '' 
moaned Sonya , aghast . 
`` I hate you , I hate you ! 
You 're my enemy forever ! '' 
And Natasha ran out of the room . 
Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her . 
With the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house , taking up now one occupation , now another , and at once abandoning them . 
Hard as it was for Sonya , she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight . 
The day before the count was to return , Sonya noticed that Natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past , whom Sonya took to be Anatole . 
Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state . 
She answered questions at random , began sentences she did not finish , and laughed at everything . 
After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha 's door timidly waiting to let her pass . 
She let the girl go in , and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered . 
Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening . 
Sonya knocked at her door . 
Natasha did not let her in . 
`` She will run away with him ! '' 
thought Sonya . 
`` She is capable of anything . 
There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today . 
She cried as she said good-by to Uncle , '' Sonya remembered . 
`` Yes , that 's it , she means to elope with him , but what am I to do ? '' 
thought she , recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natasha had some terrible intention . 
`` The count is away . 
What am I to do ? 
Write to Kuragin demanding an explanation ? 
But what is there to oblige him to reply ? 
Write to Pierre , as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune ? 
... But perhaps she really has already refused Bolkonski -- she sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday . 
And Uncle is away ... '' To tell Marya Dmitrievna who had such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible . 
`` Well , anyway , '' thought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage , `` now or never I must prove that I remember the family 's goodness to me and that I love Nicholas . 
Yes ! 
If I do n't sleep for three nights I 'll not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced , '' thought she . 
Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov 's . 
The plan for Natalie Rostova 's abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dolokhov a few days before , and on the day that Sonya , after listening at Natasha 's door , resolved to safeguard her , it was to have been put into execution . 
Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening . 
Kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka , where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them . 
At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad , and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses . 
Anatole had a passport , an order for post horses , ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with Dolokhov 's help . 
Two witnesses for the mock marriage -- Khvostikov , a retired petty official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions , and Makarin , a retired hussar , a kindly , weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for Kuragin -- were sitting at tea in Dolokhov 's front room . 
In his large study , the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with Persian rugs , bearskins , and weapons , sat Dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots , at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money . 
Anatole , with uniform unbuttoned , walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting , through the study to the room behind , where his French valet and others were packing the last of his things . 
Dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down . 
`` Well , '' he said , `` Khvostikov must have two thousand . '' 
`` Give it to him , then , '' said Anatole . 
`` Makarka '' -LRB- their name for Makarin -RRB- `` will go through fire and water for you for nothing . 
So here are our accounts all settled , '' said Dolokhov , showing him the memorandum . 
`` Is that right ? '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' returned Anatole , evidently not listening to Dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face . 
Dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile : `` Do you know ? 
You 'd really better drop it all . 
There 's still time ! '' 
`` Fool , '' retorted Anatole . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense ! 
If you only knew ... it 's the devil knows what ! '' 
`` No , really , give it up ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
`` I am speaking seriously . 
It 's no joke , this plot you 've hatched . '' 
`` What , teasing again ? 
Go to the devil ! 
Eh ? '' 
said Anatole , making a grimace . 
`` Really it 's no time for your stupid jokes , '' and he left the room . 
Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out . 
`` You wait a bit , '' he called after him .
