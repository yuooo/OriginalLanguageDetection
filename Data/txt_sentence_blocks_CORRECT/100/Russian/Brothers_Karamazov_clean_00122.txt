I should like to have a chat with you , my dear boy , but I have n't the time . 
And there 's no need , it 's too late for talking . 
Where 's my money ? 
Where have I put it ? '' 
he cried , thrusting his hands into his pockets . 
`` You put it on the table ... yourself ... . 
Here it is . 
Had you forgotten ? 
Money 's like dirt or water to you , it seems . 
Here are your pistols . 
It 's an odd thing , at six o'clock you pledged them for ten roubles , and now you 've got thousands . 
Two or three I should say . '' 
`` Three , you bet , '' laughed Mitya , stuffing the notes into the side-pocket of his trousers . 
`` You 'll lose it like that . 
Have you found a gold mine ? '' 
`` The mines ? 
The gold mines ? '' 
Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and went off into a roar of laughter . 
`` Would you like to go to the mines , Perhotin ? 
There 's a lady here who 'll stump up three thousand for you , if only you 'll go . 
She did it for me , she 's so awfully fond of gold mines . 
Do you know Madame Hohlakov ? '' 
`` I do n't know her , but I 've heard of her and seen her . 
Did she really give you three thousand ? 
Did she really ? '' 
said Pyotr Ilyitch , eyeing him dubiously . 
`` As soon as the sun rises to-morrow , as soon as Phoebus , ever young , flies upwards , praising and glorifying God , you go to her , this Madame Hohlakov , and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not . 
Try and find out . '' 
`` I do n't know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively , I suppose she did give it to you . 
You 've got the money in your hand , but instead of going to Siberia you 're spending it all ... . 
Where are you really off to now , eh ? '' 
`` To Mokroe . '' 
`` To Mokroe ? 
But it 's night ! '' 
`` Once the lad had all , now the lad has naught , '' cried Mitya suddenly . 
`` How ` naught ' ? 
You say that with all those thousands ! '' 
`` I 'm not talking about thousands . 
Damn thousands ! 
I 'm talking of female character . 
Fickle is the heart of woman Treacherous and full of vice ; I agree with Ulysses . 
That 's what he says . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ! '' 
`` Am I drunk ? '' 
`` Not drunk , but worse . '' 
`` I 'm drunk in spirit , Pyotr Ilyitch , drunk in spirit ! 
But that 's enough ! '' 
`` What are you doing , loading the pistol ? '' 
`` I 'm loading the pistol . '' 
Unfastening the pistol-case , Mitya actually opened the powder horn , and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge . 
Then he took the bullet and , before inserting it , held it in two fingers in front of the candle . 
`` Why are you looking at the bullet ? '' 
asked Pyotr Ilyitch , watching him with uneasy curiosity . 
`` Oh , a fancy . 
Why , if you meant to put that bullet in your brain , would you look at it or not ? '' 
`` Why look at it ? '' 
`` It 's going into my brain , so it 's interesting to look and see what it 's like . 
But that 's foolishness , a moment 's foolishness . 
Now that 's done , '' he added , putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod . 
`` Pyotr Ilyitch , my dear fellow , that 's nonsense , all nonsense , and if only you knew what nonsense ! 
Give me a little piece of paper now . '' 
`` Here 's some paper . '' 
`` No , a clean new piece , writing-paper . 
That 's right . '' 
And taking a pen from the table , Mitya rapidly wrote two lines , folded the paper in four , and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket . 
He put the pistols in the case , locked it up , and kept it in his hand . 
Then he looked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow , thoughtful smile . 
`` Now , let 's go . '' 
`` Where are we going ? 
No , wait a minute ... . 
Are you thinking of putting that bullet in your brain , perhaps ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily . 
`` I was fooling about the bullet ! 
I want to live . 
I love life , You may be sure of that . 
I love golden-haired Phorbus and his warm light ... . 
Dear Pyotr Ilyitch , do you know how to step aside ? '' 
`` What do you mean by ` stepping aside ' ? '' 
`` Making way . 
Making way for a dear creature , and for one I hate . 
And to let the one I hate become dear - that 's what making way means ! 
And to say to them : God bless you , go your way , pass on , while I - '' `` While you - ? '' 
`` That 's enough , let 's go . '' 
`` Upon my word . 
I 'll tell someone to prevent your going there , '' said Pyotr Ilyitch , looking at him . 
`` What are you going to Mokroe for , now ? '' 
`` There 's a woman there , a woman . 
That 's enough for you . 
You shut up . '' 
`` Listen , though you 're such a savage I 've always liked you ... . 
I feel anxious . '' 
`` Thanks , old fellow . 
I 'm a savage you say . 
Savages , savages ! 
That 's what I am always saying . 
Savages ! 
Why , here 's Misha ! 
I was forgetting him . '' 
Misha ran in , post-haste , with a handful of notes in change , and reported that everyone was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs ' ; `` They 're carrying down the bottles , and the fish , and the tea ; it will all be ready directly . '' 
Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr Ilyitch , then tossed another ten-rouble note to Misha .
