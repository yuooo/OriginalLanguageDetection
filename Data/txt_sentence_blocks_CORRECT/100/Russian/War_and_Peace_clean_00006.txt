`` They say the ball will be very good , '' replied the princess , drawing up her downy little lip . 
`` All the pretty women in society will be there . '' 
`` Not all , for you will not be there ; not all , '' said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully ; and snatching the shawl from the footman , whom he even pushed aside , he began wrapping it round the princess . 
Either from awkwardness or intentionally -LRB- no one could have said which -RRB- after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time , as though embracing her . 
Still smiling , she gracefully moved away , turning and glancing at her husband . 
Prince Andrew 's eyes were closed , so weary and sleepy did he seem . 
`` Are you ready ? '' 
he asked his wife , looking past her . 
Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak , which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels , and , stumbling in it , ran out into the porch following the princess , whom a footman was helping into the carriage . 
`` Princesse , au revoir , '' cried he , stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet . 
The princess , picking up her dress , was taking her seat in the dark carriage , her husband was adjusting his saber ; Prince Hippolyte , under pretense of helping , was in everyone 's way . 
`` Allow me , sir , '' said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold , disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path . 
`` I am expecting you , Pierre , '' said the same voice , but gently and affectionately . 
The postilion started , the carriage wheels rattled . 
Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home . 
`` Well , mon cher , '' said the vicomte , having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage , `` your little princess is very nice , very nice indeed , quite French , '' and he kissed the tips of his fingers . 
Hippolyte burst out laughing . 
`` Do you know , you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs , '' continued the vicomte . 
`` I pity the poor husband , that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch . '' 
Hippolyte spluttered again , and amid his laughter said , `` And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French ? 
One has to know how to deal with them . '' 
Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew 's study like one quite at home , and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa , took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand -LRB- it was Caesar 's Commentaries -RRB- , and resting on his elbow , began reading it in the middle . 
`` What have you done to Mlle Scherer ? 
She will be quite ill now , '' said Prince Andrew , as he entered the study , rubbing his small white hands . 
Pierre turned his whole body , making the sofa creak . 
He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew , smiled , and waved his hand . 
`` That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light ... . 
In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but -- I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power ... '' It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation . 
`` One ca n't everywhere say all one thinks , mon cher . 
Well , have you at last decided on anything ? 
Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence . 
Pierre sat up on the sofa , with his legs tucked under him . 
`` Really , I do n't yet know . 
I do n't like either the one or the other . '' 
`` But you must decide on something ! 
Your father expects it . '' 
Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor , and had remained away till he was twenty . 
When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man , `` Now go to Petersburg , look round , and choose your profession . 
I will agree to anything . 
Here is a letter to Prince Vasili , and here is money . 
Write to me all about it , and I will help you in everything . '' 
Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months , and had not decided on anything . 
It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking . 
Pierre rubbed his forehead . 
`` But he must be a Freemason , '' said he , referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening . 
`` That is all nonsense . '' 
Prince Andrew again interrupted him , `` let us talk business . 
Have you been to the Horse Guards ? '' 
`` No , I have not ; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you . 
There is a war now against Napoleon . 
If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army ; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right . '' 
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre 's childish words . 
He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense , but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question . 
`` If no one fought except on his own conviction , there would be no wars , '' he said . 
`` And that would be splendid , '' said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew smiled ironically . 
`` Very likely it would be splendid , but it will never come about ... '' `` Well , why are you going to the war ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` What for ? 
I do n't know . 
I must . 
Besides that I am going ... '' He paused . 
`` I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me ! '' 
The rustle of a woman 's dress was heard in the next room . 
Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up , and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pavlovna 's drawing room . 
Pierre removed his feet from the sofa . 
The princess came in . 
She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other . 
Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her . 
`` How is it , '' she began , as usual in French , settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair , `` how is it Annette never got married ? 
How stupid you men all are not to have married her ! 
Excuse me for saying so , but you have no sense about women . 
What an argumentative fellow you are , Monsieur Pierre ! '' 
`` And I am still arguing with your husband . 
I ca n't understand why he wants to go to the war , '' replied Pierre , addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women . 
The princess started . 
Evidently Pierre 's words touched her to the quick . 
`` Ah , that is just what I tell him ! '' 
said she . 
`` I do n't understand it ; I do n't in the least understand why men ca n't live without wars . 
How is it that we women do n't want anything of the kind , do n't need it ? 
Now you shall judge between us . 
I always tell him : Here he is Uncle 's aide-de-camp , a most brilliant position . 
He is so well known , so much appreciated by everyone . 
The other day at the Apraksins ' I heard a lady asking , ` Is that the famous Prince Andrew ? ' 
I did indeed . '' 
She laughed . 
`` He is so well received everywhere . 
He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor . 
You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously . 
Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it . 
What do you think ? '' 
Pierre looked at his friend and , noticing that he did not like the conversation , gave no reply . 
`` When are you starting ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Oh , do n't speak of his going , do n't ! 
I wo n't hear it spoken of , '' said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member . 
`` Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know , Andre ... '' -LRB- she looked significantly at her husband -RRB- `` I 'm afraid , I 'm afraid ! '' 
she whispered , and a shudder ran down her back .
