It was empty , and lying on the floor by the bed , behind the screen . '' 
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck . 
`` Gentlemen , it 's Smerdyakov ! '' 
he shouted suddenly , at the top of his voice . 
`` It 's he who 's murdered him ! 
He 's robbed him ! 
No one else knew where the old man hid the envelope . 
It 's Smerdyakov , that 's clear , now ! '' 
`` But you , too , knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow . '' 
`` I never knew it . 
I 've never seen it . 
This is the first time I 've looked at it . 
I 'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov ... . 
He was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden , I did n't know ... '' Mitya was completely breathless . 
`` But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father 's pillow . 
You especially stated that it was under the pillow , so you must have known it . '' 
`` We 've got it written down , '' confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Nonsense ! 
It 's absurd ! 
I 'd no idea it was under the pillow . 
And perhaps it was n't under the pillow at all ... . 
It was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow . 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
Have you asked him where it was ? 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
That 's the chief point ... . 
And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself ... . 
I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow , and now you - Oh , you know how one says the wrong thing , without meaning it . 
No one knew but Smerdyakov , only Smerdyakov , and no one else ... . 
He did n't even tell me where it was ! 
But it 's his doing , his doing ; there 's no doubt about it , he murdered him , that 's as clear as daylight now , '' Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically , repeating himself incoherently , and growing more and more exasperated and excited . 
`` You must understand that , and arrest him at once ... . 
He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious , that 's clear now ... . 
He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal , and without the signal father would never have opened the door ... '' `` But you 're again forgetting the circumstance , '' the prosecutor observed , still speaking with the same restraint , though with a note of triumph , `` that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there , while you were in the garden ... '' `` The door , the door , '' muttered Mitya , and he stared speechless at the prosecutor . 
He sank back helpless in his chair . 
All were silent . 
`` Yes , the door ! 
... It 's a nightmare ! 
God is against me ! '' 
he exclaimed , staring before him in complete stupefaction . 
`` Come , you see , '' the prosecutor went on with dignity , `` and you can judge for yourself , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
On the one hand , we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out , a fact which overwhelms you and us . 
On the other side , your incomprehensible , persistent , and , so to speak , obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands , when only three hours earlier , on your own showing , you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles ! 
In view of all these facts , judge for yourself . 
What are we to believe , and what can we depend upon ? 
And do n't accuse us of being ` frigid , cynical , scoffing people , ' who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart ... . 
Try to enter into our position ... '' Mitya was indescribably agitated . 
He turned pale . 
`` Very well ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly , `` I will tell you my secret . 
I 'll tell you where I got the money ! 
... I 'll reveal my shame , that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter . '' 
`` And believe me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch , in a voice of almost pathetic delight , `` that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may , later on , have an immense influence in your favour , and may , indeed , moreover - '' But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table , and he checked himself in time . 
Mitya , it is true , had not heard him . 
Mitya 's Great Secret Received with Hisses `` GENTLEMEN , '' he began , still in the same agitation , `` I want to make a full confession : that money was my own . '' 
The lawyer 's faces lengthened . 
That was not at all what they expected . 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` when at five o'clock on the same day , from your own confession - '' `` Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession ! 
That 's nothing to do with it now ! 
That money was my own , my own , that is , stolen by me ... not mine , I mean , but stolen by me , and it was fifteen hundred roubles , and I had it on me all the time , all the time ... '' `` But where did you get it ? '' 
`` I took it off my neck , gentlemen , off this very neck ... it was here , round my neck , sewn up in a rag , and I 'd had it round my neck a long time , it 's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace ! '' 
`` And from whom did you ... appropriate it ? '' 
`` You mean , ` steal it ' ? 
Speak out plainly now . 
Yes , I consider that I practically stole it , but , if you prefer , I ` appropriated it . ' 
I consider I stole it . 
And last night I stole it finally . '' 
`` Last night ? 
But you said that it 's a month since you ... obtained it ? 
... '' `` Yes . 
But not from my father . 
Not from my father , do n't be uneasy . 
I did n't steal it from my father , but from her . 
Let me tell you without interrupting . 
It 's hard to do , you know . 
You see , a month ago , I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna , formerly my betrothed . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` I know you know her . 
She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that . 
No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me .
