As soon as Rostov heard them , an enormous load of doubt fell from him . 
He was glad , and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him , but the task he had begun had to be completed . 
`` Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine , '' muttered Telyanin , taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room . 
`` We must have an explanation ... '' `` I know it and shall prove it , '' said Rostov . 
`` I. . . '' 
Every muscle of Telyanin 's pale , terrified face began to quiver , his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rostov 's face , and his sobs were audible . 
`` Count ! 
... Do n't ruin a young fellow ... here is this wretched money , take it ... '' He threw it on the table . 
`` I have an old father and mother ! 
... '' Rostov took the money , avoiding Telyanin 's eyes , and went out of the room without a word . 
But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps . 
`` O God , '' he said with tears in his eyes , `` how could you do it ? '' 
`` Count ... '' said Telyanin drawing nearer to him . 
`` Do n't touch me , '' said Rostov , drawing back . 
`` If you need it , take the money , '' and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn . 
That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron 's officers in Denisov 's quarters . 
`` And I tell you , Rostov , that you must apologize to the colonel ! '' 
said a tall , grizzly-haired staff captain , with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features , to Rostov who was crimson with excitement . 
The staff captain , Kirsten , had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission . 
`` I will allow no one to call me a liar ! '' 
cried Rostov . 
`` He told me I lied , and I told him he lied . 
And there it rests . 
He may keep me on duty every day , or may place me under arrest , but no one can make me apologize , because if he , as commander of this regiment , thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction , then ... '' `` You just wait a moment , my dear fellow , and listen , '' interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass , calmly stroking his long mustache . 
`` You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen ... '' `` I 'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers . 
Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them , but I am not a diplomatist . 
That 's why I joined the hussars , thinking that here one would not need finesse ; and he tells me that I am lying -- so let him give me satisfaction ... '' `` That 's all right . 
No one thinks you a coward , but that 's not the point . 
Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander ? '' 
Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation , evidently with no wish to take part in it . 
He answered the staff captain 's question by a disapproving shake of his head . 
`` You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers , '' continued the staff captain , `` and Bogdanich '' -LRB- the colonel was called Bogdanich -RRB- `` shuts you up . '' 
`` He did not shut me up , he said I was telling an untruth . '' 
`` Well , have it so , and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize . '' 
`` Not on any account ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov . 
`` I did not expect this of you , '' said the staff captain seriously and severely . 
`` You do n't wish to apologize , but , man , it 's not only to him but to the whole regiment -- all of us -- you 're to blame all round . 
The case is this : you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice ; but no , you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers . 
Now what was the colonel to do ? 
Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment ? 
Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel ? 
Is that how you look at it ? 
We do n't see it like that . 
And Bogdanich was a brick : he told you you were saying what was not true . 
It 's not pleasant , but what 's to be done , my dear fellow ? 
You landed yourself in it . 
And now , when one wants to smooth the thing over , some conceit prevents your apologizing , and you wish to make the whole affair public . 
You are offended at being put on duty a bit , but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer ? 
Whatever Bogdanich may be , anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel ! 
You 're quick at taking offense , but you do n't mind disgracing the whole regiment ! '' 
The staff captain 's voice began to tremble . 
`` You have been in the regiment next to no time , my lad , you 're here today and tomorrow you 'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said ` There are thieves among the Pavlograd officers ! ' 
But it 's not all the same to us ! 
Am I not right , Denisov ? 
It 's not the same ! '' 
Denisov remained silent and did not move , but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostov . 
`` You value your own pride and do n't wish to apologize , '' continued the staff captain , `` but we old fellows , who have grown up in and , God willing , are going to die in the regiment , we prize the honor of the regiment , and Bogdanich knows it . 
Oh , we do prize it , old fellow ! 
And all this is not right , it 's not right ! 
You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth . 
It 's not right ! '' 
And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov . 
`` That 's twue , devil take it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , jumping up . 
`` Now then , Wostov , now then ! '' 
Rostov , growing red and pale alternately , looked first at one officer and then at the other . 
`` No , gentlemen , no ... you must n't think ... I quite understand . 
You 're wrong to think that of me ... I. . . 
for me ... for the honor of the regiment I 'd ... Ah well , I 'll show that in action , and for me the honor of the flag ... Well , never mind , it 's true I 'm to blame , to blame all round . 
Well , what else do you want ? 
... '' `` Come , that 's right , Count ! '' 
cried the staff captain , turning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand . 
`` I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , `` he 's a fine fellow . '' 
`` That 's better , Count , '' said the staff captain , beginning to address Rostov by his title , as if in recognition of his confession . 
`` Go and apologize , your excellency . 
Yes , go ! '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'll do anything . 
No one shall hear a word from me , '' said Rostov in an imploring voice , `` but I ca n't apologize , by God I ca n't , do what you will ! 
How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness ? '' 
Denisov began to laugh . 
`` It 'll be worse for you . 
Bogdanich is vindictive and you 'll pay for your obstinacy , '' said Kirsten . 
`` No , on my word it 's not obstinacy ! 
I ca n't describe the feeling . 
I ca n't ... '' `` Well , it 's as you like , '' said the staff captain . 
`` And what has become of that scoundrel ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He has weported himself sick , he 's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow , '' muttered Denisov . 
`` It is an illness , there 's no other way of explaining it , '' said the staff captain . 
`` Illness or not , he 'd better not cwoss my path . 
I 'd kill him ! '' 
shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone . 
Just then Zherkov entered the room . 
`` What brings you here ? '' 
cried the officers turning to the newcomer . 
`` We 're to go into action , gentlemen ! 
Mack has surrendered with his whole army . '' 
`` It 's not true ! '' 
`` I 've seen him myself ! ''
