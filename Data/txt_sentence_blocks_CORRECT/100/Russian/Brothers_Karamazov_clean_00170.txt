Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense , not expressly for Ilusha , but for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter . 
But , as he had come , she had asked him to see Ilusha as well , and the captain had been told to expect him . 
He had n't the slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming , though he had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting . 
At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room , the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha 's bed , looking at a tiny mastiff pup , which had only been born the day before , though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha , who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka . 
Ilusha , who had heard three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy , not an ordinary puppy , but a pedigree mastiff -LRB- a very important point , of course -RRB- , tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased . 
But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had killed . 
The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he , smiling sadly , stroked it with his thin , pale , wasted hand . 
Clearly he liked the puppy , but ... it was n't Zhutchka ; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy , too , then he would have been completely happy . 
`` Krassotkin ! '' 
cried one of the boys suddenly . 
He was the first to see him come in . 
Krassotkin 's entrance made a general sensation ; the boys moved away and stood on each side of the bed , so that he could get a full view of Ilusha . 
The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya . 
`` Please come in ... you are welcome ! '' 
he said hurriedly . 
`` Ilusha , Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you ! 
But Krassotkin , shaking hands with him hurriedly , instantly showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society . 
He turned first to the captain 's wife sitting in her armchair , who was very ill-humoured at the moment , and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha 's bed and did not let her see the new puppy . 
With the greatest courtesy he made her a bow , scraping his foot , and turning to Nina , he made her , as the only other lady present , a similar bow . 
This polite behaviour made an extremely favourable impression on the deranged lady . 
`` There , . 
you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought up , '' she commented aloud , throwing up her hands ; `` But as for our other visitors they come in one on the top of another . '' 
`` How do you mean , mamma , one on the top of another , how is that ? '' 
muttered the captain affectionately , though a little anxious on her account . 
`` That 's how they ride in . 
They get on each other 's shoulders in the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family . 
Strange sort of visitors ! '' 
`` But who 's come in like that , mamma ? '' 
`` Why , that boy came in riding on that one 's back and this one on that one 's . '' 
Kolya was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy turned visibly paler . 
He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya . 
Kolya had not seen his little friend for two months , and he was overwhelmed at the sight of him . 
He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted , yellow face , such enormous , feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands . 
He saw , with grieved surprise , Ilusha 's rapid , hard breathing and dry lips . 
He stepped close to him , held out his hand , and almost overwhelmed , he said : `` Well , old man ... how are you ? '' 
But his voice failed him , he could n't achieve an appearance of ease ; his face suddenly twitched and the corners of his mouth quivered . 
Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile , still unable to utter a word . 
Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it over Ilusha 's hair . 
`` Never mind ! '' 
he murmured softly to him to cheer him up , or perhaps not knowing why he said it . 
For a minute they were silent again . 
`` Hallo , so you 've got a new puppy ? '' 
Kolya said suddenly , in a most callous voice . 
`` Ye-es , '' answered Ilusha in a long whisper , gasping for breath . 
`` A black nose , that means he 'll be fierce , a good house-dog , '' Kolya observed gravely and stolidly , as if the only thing he cared about was the puppy and its black nose . 
But in reality he still had to do his utmost to control his feelings not to burst out crying like a child , and do what he would he could not control it . 
`` When it grows up , you 'll have to keep it on the chain , I 'm sure . '' 
`` He 'll be a huge dog ! '' 
cried one of the boys . 
`` Of course he will , '' `` a mastiff , '' `` large , '' `` like this , '' `` as big as a calf , '' shouted several voices . 
`` As big as a calf , as a real calf , '' chimed in the captain . 
`` I got one like that on purpose , one of the fiercest breed , and his parents are huge and very fierce , they stand as high as this from the floor ... . 
Sit down here , on Ilusha 's bed , or here on the bench . 
You are welcome , we 've been hoping to see you a long time ... . 
You were so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed , at Ilusha 's feet . 
Though he had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way , now he completely lost the thread of it . 
`` No ... I came with Perezvon . 
I 've got a dog now , called Perezvon . 
A Slavonic name . 
He 's out there ... if I whistle , he 'll run in . 
I 've brought a dog , too , '' he said , addressing Ilusha all at once . 
`` Do you remember Zhutchka , old man ? '' 
he suddenly fired the question at him . 
Ilusha 's little face quivered . 
He looked with an agonised expression at Kolya . 
Alyosha , standing at the door , frowned and signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka , but he did not or would not notice . 
`` Where ... is Zhutchka ? '' 
Ilusha asked in a broken voice . 
`` Oh well , my boy , your Zhutchka 's lost and done for ! '' 
Ilusha did not speak , but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya . 
Alyosha , catching Kolya 's eye , signed to him vigourously again , but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed . 
`` It must have run away and died somewhere . 
It must have died after a meal like that , '' Kolya pronounced pitilessly , though he seemed a little breathless . 
`` But I 've got a dog , Perezvon ... A Slavonic name ... I 've brought him to show you . '' 
`` I do n't want him ! '' 
said Ilusha suddenly . 
`` No , no , you really must see him ... it will amuse you . 
I brought him on purpose ... . 
He 's the same sort of shaggy dog ... . 
You allow me to call in my dog , madam ? '' 
He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov , with inexplicable excitement in his manner . 
`` I do n't want him , I do n't want him ! '' 
cried Ilusha , with a mournful break in his voice . 
There was a reproachful light in his eyes . 
`` You 'd better , '' the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he had just sat down , `` you 'd better ... another time , '' he muttered , but Kolya could not be restrained . 
He hurriedly shouted to Smurov , `` Open the door , '' and as soon as it was open , he blew his whistle . 
Perezvon dashed headlong into the room . 
`` Jump , Perezvon , beg ! 
Beg ! '' 
shouted Kolya , jumping up , and the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha 's bedside . 
What followed was a surprise to everyone : Ilusha started , lurched violently forward , bent over Perezvon and gazed at him , faint with suspense . 
`` It 's ... Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried suddenly , in a voice breaking with joy and suffering . 
`` And who did you think it was ? '' 
Krassotkin shouted with all his might , in a ringing , happy voice , and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to Ilusha . 
`` Look , old man , you see , blind of one eye and the left ear is torn , just the marks you described to me . 
It was by that I found him . 
I found him directly .
