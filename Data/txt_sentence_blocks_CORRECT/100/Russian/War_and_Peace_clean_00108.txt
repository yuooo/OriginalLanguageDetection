It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying , but could not . 
The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms , dreams , and hopes of happiness or goodness , in Prince Andrew 's presence . 
He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views , which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour . 
He checked himself , fearing to seem naive , yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different , and better , Pierre than he had been in Petersburg . 
`` I ca n't tell you how much I have lived through since then . 
I hardly know myself again . '' 
`` Yes , we have altered much , very much , since then , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you ? 
What are your plans ? '' 
`` Plans ! '' 
repeated Prince Andrew ironically . 
`` My plans ? '' 
he said , as if astonished at the word . 
`` Well , you see , I 'm building . 
I mean to settle here altogether next year ... '' Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew 's face , which had grown much older . 
`` No , I meant to ask ... '' Pierre began , but Prince Andrew interrupted him . 
`` But why talk of me ? 
... Talk to me , yes , tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates . '' 
Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates , trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made . 
Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre 's story of what he had been doing , as though it were all an old-time story , and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him . 
Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend 's company and at last became silent . 
`` I 'll tell you what , my dear fellow , '' said Prince Andrew , who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor , `` I am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round . 
I am going back to my sister today . 
I will introduce you to her . 
But of course you know her already , '' he said , evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common . 
`` We will go after dinner . 
And would you now like to look round my place ? '' 
They went out and walked about till dinnertime , talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately . 
Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings , but even here , while on the scaffolding , in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house , he interrupted himself : `` However , this is not at all interesting . 
Let us have dinner , and then we 'll set off . '' 
At dinner , conversation turned on Pierre 's marriage . 
`` I was very much surprised when I heard of it , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre blushed , as he always did when it was mentioned , and said hurriedly : `` I will tell you some time how it all happened . 
But you know it is all over , and forever . '' 
`` Forever ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Nothing 's forever . '' 
`` But you know how it all ended , do n't you ? 
You heard of the duel ? '' 
`` And so you had to go through that too ! '' 
`` One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man , '' said Pierre . 
`` Why so ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` To kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really . '' 
`` No , to kill a man is bad -- wrong . '' 
`` Why is it wrong ? '' 
urged Prince Andrew . 
`` It is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong . 
Men always did and always will err , and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong . '' 
`` What does harm to another is wrong , '' said Pierre , feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused , had begun to talk , and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state . 
`` And who has told you what is bad for another man ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Bad ! 
Bad ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre . 
`` We all know what is bad for ourselves . '' 
`` Yes , we know that , but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I can not inflict on others , '' said Prince Andrew , growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre . 
He spoke in French . 
`` I only know two very real evils in life : remorse and illness . 
The only good is the absence of those evils . 
To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now . '' 
`` And love of one 's neighbor , and self-sacrifice ? '' 
began Pierre . 
`` No , I ca n't agree with you ! 
To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough . 
I lived like that , I lived for myself and ruined my life . 
And only now when I am living , or at least trying '' -LRB- Pierre 's modesty made him correct himself -RRB- `` to live for others , only now have I understood all the happiness of life . 
No , I shall not agree with you , and you do not really believe what you are saying . '' 
Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile . 
`` When you see my sister , Princess Mary , you 'll get on with her , '' he said . 
`` Perhaps you are right for yourself , '' he added after a short pause , `` but everyone lives in his own way . 
You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others . 
I experienced just the reverse . 
I lived for glory . 
-- And after all what is glory ? 
The same love of others , a desire to do something for them , a desire for their approval . 
-- So I lived for others , and not almost , but quite , ruined my life . 
And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself . '' 
`` But what do you mean by living only for yourself ? '' 
asked Pierre , growing excited . 
`` What about your son , your sister , and your father ? '' 
`` But that 's just the same as myself -- they are not others , '' explained Prince Andrew . 
`` The others , one 's neighbors , le prochain , as you and Princess Mary call it , are the chief source of all error and evil . 
Le prochain -- your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good . '' 
And he looked at Pierre with a mocking , challenging expression . 
He evidently wished to draw him on . 
`` You are joking , '' replied Pierre , growing more and more excited . 
`` What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good , and even doing a little -- though I did very little and did it very badly ? 
What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people , our serfs , people like ourselves , were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life , retribution , recompense , and consolation ? 
What evil and error are there in it , if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered , and I supplied them with a doctor , a hospital , and an asylum for the aged ? 
And is it not a palpable , unquestionable good if a peasant , or a woman with a baby , has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure ? '' 
said Pierre , hurrying and lisping . 
`` And I have done that though badly and to a small extent ; but I have done something toward it and you can not persuade me that it was not a good action , and more than that , you ca n't make me believe that you do not think so yourself . 
And the main thing is , '' he continued , `` that I know , and know for certain , that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life . '' 
`` Yes , if you put it like that it 's quite a different matter , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I build a house and lay out a garden , and you build hospitals . 
The one and the other may serve as a pastime . 
But what 's right and what 's good must be judged by one who knows all , but not by us . 
Well , you want an argument , '' he added , `` come on then . '' 
They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda .
