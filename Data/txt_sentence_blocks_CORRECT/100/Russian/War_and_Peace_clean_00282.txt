And not waiting for a reply he answered his own question : `` You see I was told to find out - well , I am finding out ... . 
Only do let me into the very ... into the chief ... I do n't want a reward ... But I want ... '' Petya clenched his teeth and looked around , throwing back his head and flourishing his arms . 
`` Into the vewy chief ... '' Denisov repeated with a smile . 
`` Only , please let me command something , so that I may really command ... '' Petya went on . 
`` What would it be to you ? 
... Oh , you want a knife ? '' 
he said , turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton . 
And he handed him his clasp knife . 
The officer admired it . 
`` Please keep it . 
I have several like it , '' said Petya , blushing . 
`` Heavens ! 
I was quite forgetting ! '' 
he suddenly cried . 
`` I have some raisins , fine ones ; you know , seedless ones . 
We have a new sutler and he has such capital things . 
I bought ten pounds . 
I am used to something sweet . 
Would you like some ? 
... '' and Petya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins . 
`` Have some , gentlemen , have some ! '' 
`` You want a coffeepot , do n't you ? '' 
he asked the esaul . 
`` I bought a capital one from our sutler ! 
He has splendid things . 
And he 's very honest , that 's the chief thing . 
I 'll be sure to send it to you . 
Or perhaps your flints are giving out , or are worn out -- that happens sometimes , you know . 
I have brought some with me , here they are '' - and he showed a bag -- `` a hundred flints . 
I bought them very cheap . 
Please take as many as you want , or all if you like ... '' Then suddenly , dismayed lest he had said too much , Petya stopped and blushed . 
He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish . 
And running over the events of the day he remembered the French drummer boy . 
`` It 's capital for us here , but what of him ? 
Where have they put him ? 
Have they fed him ? 
Have n't they hurt his feelings ? '' 
he thought . 
But having caught himself saying too much about the flints , he was now afraid to speak out . 
`` I might ask , '' he thought , `` but they 'll say : ` He 's a boy himself and so he pities the boy . ' 
I 'll show them tomorrow whether I 'm a boy . 
Will it seem odd if I ask ? '' 
Petya thought . 
`` Well , never mind ! '' 
and immediately , blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical , he said : `` May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat ? 
... Perhaps ... '' `` Yes , he 's a poor little fellow , '' said Denisov , who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder . 
`` Call him in . 
His name is Vincent Bosse . 
Have him fetched . '' 
`` I 'll call him , '' said Petya . 
`` Yes , yes , call him . 
A poor little fellow , '' Denisov repeated . 
Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this . 
He slipped in between the officers , came close to Denisov , and said : `` Let me kiss you , dear old fellow ! 
Oh , how fine , how splendid ! '' 
And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut . 
`` Bosse ! 
Vincent ! '' 
Petya cried , stopping outside the door . 
`` Who do you want , sir ? '' 
asked a voice in the darkness . 
Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that day . 
`` Ah , Vesenny ? '' 
said a Cossack . 
Vincent , the boy 's name , had already been changed by the Cossacks into Vesenny -LRB- vernal -RRB- and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers . 
In both these adaptations the reference to spring -LRB- vesna -RRB- matched the impression made by the young lad . 
`` He is warming himself there by the bonfire . 
Ho , Vesenya ! 
Vesenya ! 
-- Vesenny ! '' 
laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness . 
`` He 's a smart lad , '' said an hussar standing near Petya . 
`` We gave him something to eat a while ago . 
He was awfully hungry ! '' 
The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness , and the drummer boy came to the door . 
`` Ah , c'est vous ! '' 
said Petya . 
`` Voulez-vous manger ? 
N'ayez pas peur , on ne vous fera pas de mal , '' * he added shyly and affectionately , touching the boy 's hand . 
`` Entrez , entrez . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- * `` Ah , it 's you ! 
Do you want something to eat ? 
Do n't be afraid , they wo n't hurt you . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` Come in , come in . '' 
`` Merci , monsieur , '' * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice , and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold . 
* `` Thank you , sir . '' 
There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy , but did not dare to . 
He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage . 
Then in the darkness he took the boy 's hand and pressed it . 
`` Come in , come in ! '' 
he repeated in a gentle whisper . 
`` Oh , what can I do for him ? '' 
he thought , and opening the door he let the boy pass in first . 
When the boy had entered the hut , Petya sat down at a distance from him , considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him . 
But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy . 
The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya 's attention from the drummer boy , to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given , and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners . 
Petya had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov 's extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the French , so from the moment he entered the hut Petya did not take his eyes from him , but braced himself up more and more and held his head high , that he might not be unworthy even of such company . 
Dolokhov 's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity . 
Denisov wore a Cossack coat , had a beard , had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder-Worker on his breast , and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position . 
But Dolokhov , who in Moscow had worn a Persian costume , had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the Guards .
