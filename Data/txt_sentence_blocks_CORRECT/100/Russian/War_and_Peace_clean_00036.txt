He wore an unfastened cloak , wide breeches hanging down in creases , and a crumpled shako on the back of his head . 
He came up to the porch gloomily , hanging his head . 
`` Lavwuska ! '' 
he shouted loudly and angrily , `` take it off , blockhead ! '' 
`` Well , I am taking it off , '' replied Lavrushka 's voice . 
`` Ah , you 're up already , '' said Denisov , entering the room . 
`` Long ago , '' answered Rostov , `` I have already been for the hay , and have seen Fraulein Mathilde . '' 
`` Weally ! 
And I 've been losing , bwother . 
I lost yesterday like a damned fool ! '' 
cried Denisov , not pronouncing his r 's . 
`` Such ill luck ! 
Such ill luck . 
As soon as you left , it began and went on . 
Hullo there ! 
Tea ! '' 
Puckering up his face though smiling , and showing his short strong teeth , he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair . 
`` And what devil made me go to that wat ? '' 
-LRB- an officer nicknamed `` the rat '' -RRB- he said , rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands . 
`` Just fancy , he did n't let me win a single cahd , not one cahd . '' 
He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him , gripped it in his fist , and tapped it on the floor , making the sparks fly , while he continued to shout . 
`` He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it ; gives the singles and snatches the doubles ! '' 
He scattered the burning tobacco , smashed the pipe , and threw it away . 
Then he remained silent for a while , and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering , black eyes at Rostov . 
`` If at least we had some women here ; but there 's nothing foh one to do but dwink . 
If we could only get to fighting soon . 
Hullo , who 's there ? '' 
he said , turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop , and a respectful cough . 
`` The squadron quartermaster ! '' 
said Lavrushka . 
Denisov 's face puckered still more . 
`` Wetched ! '' 
he muttered , throwing down a purse with some gold in it . 
`` Wostov , deah fellow , just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow , '' he said , and went out to the quartermaster . 
Rostov took the money and , mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles , began counting them . 
`` Ah ! 
Telyanin ! 
How d'ye do ? 
They plucked me last night , '' came Denisov 's voice from the next room . 
`` Where ? 
At Bykov 's , at the rat 's ... I knew it , '' replied a piping voice , and Lieutenant Telyanin , a small officer of the same squadron , entered the room . 
Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him . 
Telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign . 
He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked ; Rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man . 
`` Well , young cavalryman , how is my Rook behaving ? '' 
he asked . 
-LRB- Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov . -RRB- 
The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face ; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another . 
`` I saw you riding this morning ... '' he added . 
`` Oh , he 's all right , a good horse , '' answered Rostov , though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum . 
`` He 's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg , '' he added . 
`` The hoof 's cracked ! 
That 's nothing . 
I 'll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use . '' 
`` Yes , please do , '' said Rostov . 
`` I 'll show you , I 'll show you ! 
It 's not a secret . 
And it 's a horse you 'll thank me for . '' 
`` Then I 'll have it brought round , '' said Rostov wishing to avoid Telyanin , and he went out to give the order . 
In the passage Denisov , with a pipe , was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him . 
On seeing Rostov , Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting , he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust . 
`` Ugh ! 
I do n't like that fellow , '' he said , regardless of the quartermaster 's presence . 
Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say : `` Nor do I , but what 's one to do ? '' 
and , having given his order , he returned to Telyanin . 
Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left him , rubbing his small white hands . 
`` Well there certainly are disgusting people , '' thought Rostov as he entered . 
`` Have you told them to bring the horse ? '' 
asked Telyanin , getting up and looking carelessly about him . 
`` I have . '' 
`` Let us go ourselves . 
I only came round to ask Denisov about yesterday 's order . 
Have you got it , Denisov ? '' 
`` Not yet . 
But where are you off to ? '' 
`` I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse , '' said Telyanin . 
They went through the porch and into the stable . 
The lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters . 
When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table . 
Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper . 
He looked gloomily in Rostov 's face and said : `` I am witing to her . '' 
He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and , evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write , told Rostov the contents of his letter . 
`` You see , my fwiend , '' he said , `` we sleep when we do n't love . 
We are childwen of the dust ... but one falls in love and one is a God , one is pua ' as on the first day of cweation ... Who 's that now ? 
Send him to the devil , I 'm busy ! '' 
he shouted to Lavrushka , who went up to him not in the least abashed . 
`` Who should it be ? 
You yourself told him to come . 
It 's the quartermaster for the money . '' 
Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped . 
`` Wetched business , '' he muttered to himself . 
`` How much is left in the puhse ? '' 
he asked , turning to Rostov . 
`` Seven new and three old imperials . '' 
`` Oh , it 's wetched ! 
Well , what are you standing there for , you sca ` cwow ? 
Call the quahtehmasteh , '' he shouted to Lavrushka . 
`` Please , Denisov , let me lend you some : I have some , you know , '' said Rostov , blushing . 
`` Do n't like bowwowing from my own fellows , I do n't , '' growled Denisov . 
`` But if you wo n't accept money from me like a comrade , you will offend me .
