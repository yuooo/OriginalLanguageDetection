Such distrustfulness in Mitya , such lack of confidence even to him , to Alyosha - all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother . 
Intense , infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly . 
There was a poignant ache in his torn heart . 
`` Love Ivan '' - he suddenly recalled Mitya 's words . 
And he was going to Ivan . 
He badly wanted to see Ivan all day . 
He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya , and more than ever now . 
Not You , Not You ! 
ON the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living . 
There was light in the windows . 
He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in . 
He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week . 
But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her , especially on the eve of the terrible day . 
Ringing , and mounting the staircase , which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern , he saw a man coming down , and as they met , he recognised him as his brother . 
So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Ah , it 's only you , '' said Ivan dryly . 
`` Well , good-bye ! 
You are going to her ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I do n't advise you to ; she 's upset and you 'll upset her more . '' 
A door was instantly flung open above , and a voice cried suddenly : `` No , no ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , have you come from him ? '' 
`` Yes , I have been with him . '' 
`` Has he sent me any message ? 
Come up , Alyosha , and you , Ivan Fyodorovitch , you must come back , you must . 
Do you hear ? '' 
There was such a peremptory note in Katya 's voice that Ivan , after a moment 's hesitation , made up his mind to go back with Alyosha . 
`` She was listening , '' he murmured angrily to himself , but Alyosha heard it . 
`` Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on , '' said Ivan , going into the drawing-room . 
`` I wo n't sit down . 
I wo n't stay more than a minute . '' 
`` Sit down , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' said Katerina Ivanovna , though she remained standing . 
She had changed very little during this time , but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes . 
Alyosha remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment . 
`` What did he ask you to tell me ? '' 
`` Only one thing , '' said Alyosha , looking her straight in the face , `` that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what '' -LRB- he was a little confused -RRB- '' ... passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that I bowed down to the ground for that money ! '' 
She broke into a bitter laugh . 
`` Why , is he afraid for me or for himself ? 
He asks me to spare - whom ? 
Him or myself ? 
Tell me , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! '' 
Alyosha watched her intently , trying to understand her . 
`` Both yourself and him , '' he answered softly . 
`` I am glad to hear it , '' she snapped out maliciously , and she suddenly blushed . 
`` You do n't know me yet , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said menacingly . 
`` And I do n't know myself yet . 
Perhaps you 'll want to trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow . '' 
`` You will give your evidence honourably , '' said Alyosha ; `` that 's all that 's wanted . '' 
`` Women are often dishonourable , '' she snarled . 
`` Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no , he is still a human being to me ! 
But did he do it ? 
Is he the murderer ? '' 
she cried , all of a sudden , hysterically , turning quickly to Ivan . 
Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before , perhaps only a moment before he came in , and not for the first time , but for the hundredth , and that they had ended by quarrelling . 
`` I 've been to see Smerdyakov ... . 
It was you , you who persuaded me that he murdered his father . 
It 's only you I believed '' she continued , still addressing Ivan . 
He gave her a sort of strained smile . 
Alyosha started at her tone . 
He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them . 
`` Well , that 's enough , anyway , '' Ivan cut short the conversation . 
`` I am going . 
I 'll come to-morrow . '' 
And turning at once , he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs . 
With an imperious gesture , Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands . 
`` Follow him ! 
Overtake him ! 
Do n't leave him alone for a minute ! '' 
she said , in a hurried whisper . 
`` He 's mad ! 
Do n't you know that he 's mad ? 
He is in a fever , nervous fever . 
The doctor told me so . 
Go , run after him ... '' Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan , who was not fifty paces ahead of him . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
He turned quickly on Alyosha , seeing that he was running after him . 
`` She told you to catch me up , because I 'm mad . 
I know it all by heart , '' he added irritably . 
`` She is mistaken , of course ; but she is right that you are ill , '' said Alyosha . 
`` I was looking at your face just now . 
You look very ill , Ivan . '' 
Ivan walked on without stopping . 
Alyosha followed him . 
`` And do you know , Alexey Fyodorovitch , how people do go out of their minds ? '' 
Ivan asked in a a voice suddenly quiet , without a trace of irritation , with a note of the simplest curiosity . 
`` No , I do n't . 
I suppose there are all kinds of insanity . '' 
`` And can one observe that one 's going mad oneself ? '' 
`` I imagine one ca n't see oneself clearly in such circumstances , '' Alyosha answered with surprise . 
Ivan paused for half a minute . 
`` If you want to talk to me , please change the subject , '' he said suddenly . 
`` Oh , while I think of it , I have a letter for you , '' said Alyosha timidly , and he took Lise 's note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan . 
They were just under a lamp-post . 
Ivan recognised the handwriting at once . 
`` Ah , from that little demon ! '' 
he laughed maliciously , and , without opening the envelope , he tore it into bits and threw it in the air . 
The bits were scattered by the wind . 
`` She 's not sixteen yet , I believe , and already offering herself , '' he said contemptuously , striding along the street again .
