`` That 's not true , Lise , Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch was coming . 
She was on the lookout for you . '' 
`` My darling mamma , it 's not at all clever of you . 
But if you want to make up for it and say something very clever , dear mamma , you 'd better tell our honoured visitor , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that he has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened yesterday and although everyone is laughing at him . '' 
`` Lise , you go too far . 
I declare I shall have to be severe . 
Who laughs at him ? 
I am so glad he has come , I need him , I ca n't do without him . 
Oh , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I am exceedingly unhappy ! '' 
`` But what 's the matter with you , mamma , darling ? '' 
`` Ah , your caprices , Lise , your fidgetiness , your illness , that awful night of fever , that awful everlasting Herzenstube , everlasting , everlasting , that 's the worst of it ! 
Everything , in fact , everything ... . 
Even that miracle , too ! 
Oh , how it has upset me , how it has shattered me , that miracle , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
And that tragedy in the drawing-room , it 's more than I can bear , I warn you . 
I ca n't bear it . 
A comedy , perhaps , not a tragedy . 
Tell me , will Father Zossima live till to-morrow , will he ? 
Oh , my God ! 
What is happening to me ? 
Every minute I close my eyes and see that it 's all nonsense , all nonsense . '' 
`` I should be very grateful , '' Alyosha interrupted suddenly , `` if you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with . 
I have hurt it , and it 's very painful . '' 
Alyosha unbound his bitten finger . 
The handkerchief was soaked with blood . 
Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes . 
`` Good heavens , what a wound , how awful ! 
But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha 's finger through the crack , she flung the door wide open . 
`` Come , come here , '' she cried , imperiously . 
`` No nonsense now ! 
Good heavens , why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time ? 
He might have bled to death , mamma ! 
How did you do it ? 
Water , water ! 
You must wash it first of all , simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain , and keep it there , keep it there ... . 
Make haste , mamma , some water in a slop-basin . 
But do make haste , '' she finished nervously . 
She was quite frightened at the sight of Alyosha 's wound . 
`` Should n't we send for Herzenstube ? '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
`` Mamma , you 'll be the death of me . 
Your Herzenstube will come and say that he can make nothing of it ! 
Water , water ! 
Mamma , for goodness ' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia , she is such a slowcoach and never can come quickly ! 
Make haste , mamma , or I shall die . '' 
`` Why , it 's nothing much , '' cried Alyosha , frightened at this alarm . 
Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it . 
`` Some lint , mamma , for mercy 's sake , bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds , what 's it called ? 
We 've got some . 
You know where the bottle is , mamma ; it 's in your bedroom in the right-hand cupboard , there 's a big bottle of it there with the lint . '' 
`` I 'll bring everything in a minute , Lise , only do n't scream and do n't fuss . 
You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it . 
Where did you get such a dreadful wound , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Madame Hohlakov hastened away . 
This was all Lise was waiting for . 
`` First of all , answer the question , where did you get hurt like this ? '' 
she asked Alyosha , quickly . 
`` And then I 'll talk to you about something quite different . 
Well ? '' 
Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother 's absence was precious for her , Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the school boys in the fewest words possible . 
Lise clasped her hands at his story . 
`` How can you , and in that dress too , associate with schoolboys ? '' 
she cried angrily , as though she had a right to control him . 
`` You are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that , a perfect boy ! 
But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it , for there 's some mystery in it . 
Now for the second thing , but first a question : does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things , but talking sensibly ? '' 
`` Of course not , and I do n't feel much pain now . '' 
`` That 's because your finger is in the water . 
It must be changed directly , for it will get warm in a minute . 
Yulia , bring some ice from the cellar and another basin of water . 
Now she is gone , I can speak ; will you give me the letter I sent you yesterday , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch - be quick , for mamma will be back in a minute and I do n't want - '' `` I have n't got the letter . '' 
`` That 's not true , you have . 
I knew you would say that . 
You 've got it in that pocket . 
I 've been regretting that joke all night . 
Give me back the letter at once , give it me . '' 
`` I 've left it at home . '' 
`` But you ca n't consider me as a child , a little girl , after that silly joke ! 
I beg your pardon for that silliness , but you must bring me the letter , if you really have n't got it - bring to-day , you must , you must . '' 
`` To-day I ca n't possibly , for I am going back to the monastery and I sha n't come and see you for the next two days - three or four perhaps - for Father Zossima - '' `` Four days , what nonsense ! 
Listen . 
Did you laugh at me very much ? '' 
`` I did n't laugh at all . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Because I believed all you said . '' 
`` You are insulting me ! '' 
`` Not at all . 
As soon as I read it , I thought that all that would come to pass , for as soon as Father Zossima dies , I am to leave the monastery . 
Then I shall go back and finish my studies , and when you reach the legal age we will be married . 
I shall love you . 
Though I have n't had time to think about it , I believe I could n't find a better wife than you , and Father Zossima tells me I must marry . '' 
`` But I am a cripple , wheeled about in a chair , '' laughed Lise , flushing crimson . 
`` I 'll wheel you about myself , but I 'm sure you 'll get well by then . '' 
`` But you are mad , '' said Lise , nervously , `` to make all this nonsense out of a joke ! 
Here 's mamma , very a propos , perhaps . 
Mamma , how slow you always are , how can you be so long ! 
And here 's Yulia with the ice ! 
`` Oh , Lise , do n't scream , above all things do n't scream . 
That scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place ? 
I 've been hunting and hunting - I do believe you did it on purpose . ''
