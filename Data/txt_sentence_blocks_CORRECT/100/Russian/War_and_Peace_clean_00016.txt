We have not met for such a long time ... not since we were children . 
You might think that I. . . 
I understand , quite understand . 
I could not have done it myself , I should not have had the courage , but it 's splendid . 
I am very glad to have made your acquaintance . 
It 's queer , '' he added after a pause , `` that you should have suspected me ! '' 
He began to laugh . 
`` Well , what of it ! 
I hope we 'll get better acquainted , '' and he pressed Boris ' hand . 
`` Do you know , I have not once been in to see the count . 
He has not sent for me ... . 
I am sorry for him as a man , but what can one do ? '' 
`` And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across ? '' 
asked Boris with a smile . 
Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject , and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition . 
A footman came in to summon Boris -- the princess was going . 
Pierre , in order to make Boris ' better acquaintance , promised to come to dinner , and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Boris ' eyes . 
After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time , no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword , but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant , intelligent , and resolute young man . 
As often happens in early youth , especially to one who leads a lonely life , he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends . 
Prince Vasili saw the princess off . 
She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful . 
`` It is dreadful , dreadful ! '' 
she was saying , `` but cost me what it may I shall do my duty . 
I will come and spend the night . 
He must not be left like this . 
Every moment is precious . 
I ca n't think why his nieces put it off . 
Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him ! 
... Adieu , Prince ! 
May God support you ... '' `` Adieu , ma bonne , '' answered Prince Vasili turning away from her . 
`` Oh , he is in a dreadful state , '' said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage . 
`` He hardly recognizes anybody . '' 
`` I do n't understand , Mamma -- what is his attitude to Pierre ? '' 
asked the son . 
`` The will will show that , my dear ; our fate also depends on it . '' 
`` But why do you expect that he will leave us anything ? '' 
`` Ah , my dear ! 
He is so rich , and we are so poor ! '' 
`` Well , that is hardly a sufficient reason , Mamma ... '' `` Oh , Heaven ! 
How ill he is ! '' 
exclaimed the mother . 
After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov , Countess Rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes . 
At last she rang . 
`` What is the matter with you , my dear ? '' 
she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes . 
`` Do n't you wish to serve me ? 
Then I 'll find you another place . '' 
The countess was upset by her friend 's sorrow and humiliating poverty , and was therefore out of sorts , a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid `` my dear '' and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness . 
`` I am very sorry , ma'am , '' answered the maid . 
`` Ask the count to come to me . '' 
The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual . 
`` Well , little countess ? 
What a saute of game au madere we are to have , my dear ! 
I tasted it . 
The thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not ill-spent . 
He is worth it ! '' 
He sat down by his wife , his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair . 
`` What are your commands , little countess ? '' 
`` You see , my dear ... What 's that mess ? '' 
she said , pointing to his waistcoat . 
`` It 's the saute , most likely , '' she added with a smile . 
`` Well , you see , Count , I want some money . '' 
Her face became sad . 
`` Oh , little countess ! '' 
... and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook . 
`` I want a great deal , Count ! 
I want five hundred rubles , '' and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband 's waistcoat . 
`` Yes , immediately , immediately ! 
Hey , who 's there ? '' 
he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons . 
`` Send Dmitri to me ! '' 
Dmitri , a man of good family who had been brought up in the count 's house and now managed all his affairs , stepped softly into the room . 
`` This is what I want , my dear fellow , '' said the count to the deferential young man who had entered . 
`` Bring me ... '' he reflected a moment , `` yes , bring me seven hundred rubles , yes ! 
But mind , do n't bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time , but nice clean ones for the countess . '' 
`` Yes , Dmitri , clean ones , please , '' said the countess , sighing deeply . 
`` When would you like them , your excellency ? '' 
asked Dmitri . 
`` Allow me to inform you ... But , do n't be uneasy , '' he added , noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger . 
`` I was forgetting ... Do you wish it brought at once ? '' 
`` Yes , yes ; just so ! 
Bring it . 
Give it to the countess . '' 
`` What a treasure that Dmitri is , '' added the count with a smile when the young man had departed . 
`` There is never any ` impossible ' with him . 
That 's a thing I hate ! 
Everything is possible . '' 
`` Ah , money , Count , money ! 
How much sorrow it causes in the world , '' said the countess . 
`` But I am in great need of this sum . '' 
`` You , my little countess , are a notorious spendthrift , '' said the count , and having kissed his wife 's hand he went back to his study . 
When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov 's the money , all in clean notes , was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess ' little table , and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her . 
`` Well , my dear ? '' 
asked the countess . 
`` Oh , what a terrible state he is in ! 
One would not know him , he is so ill ! 
I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word ... '' `` Annette , for heaven 's sake do n't refuse me , '' the countess began , with a blush that looked very strange on her thin , dignified , elderly face , and she took the money from under the handkerchief . 
Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment . 
`` This is for Boris from me , for his outfit . '' 
Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping .
