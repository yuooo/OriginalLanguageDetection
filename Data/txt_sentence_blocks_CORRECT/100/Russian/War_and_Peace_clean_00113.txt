Denisov was shouting . 
`` And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields . '' 
`` I have given the order again and again , your honor , but they do n't obey , '' answered the quartermaster . 
Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently : `` Let him fuss and bustle now , my job 's done and I 'm lying down -- capitally ! '' 
He could hear that Lavrushka -- that sly , bold orderly of Denisov 's -- was talking , as well as the quartermaster . 
Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons , biscuits , and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions . 
Then Denisov 's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away . 
`` Saddle ! 
Second platoon ! '' 
`` Where are they off to now ? '' 
thought Rostov . 
Five minutes later , Denisov came into the hut , climbed with muddy boots on the bed , lit his pipe , furiously scattered his things about , took his leaded whip , buckled on his saber , and went out again . 
In answer to Rostov 's inquiry where he was going , he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business . 
`` Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards ! '' 
said Denisov going out , and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud . 
He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone . 
Having got warm in his corner , he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening . 
Denisov had not yet returned . 
The weather had cleared up , and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka , laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud . 
Rostov joined them . 
In the middle of the game , the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them . 
The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them . 
`` There now , Denisov has been worrying , '' said Rostov , `` and here are the provisions . '' 
`` So they are ! '' 
said the officers . 
`` Wo n't the soldiers be glad ! '' 
A little behind the hussars came Denisov , accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking . 
Rostov went to meet them . 
`` I warn you , Captain , '' one of the officers , a short thin man , evidently very angry , was saying . 
`` Have n't I told you I wo n't give them up ? '' 
replied Denisov . 
`` You will answer for it , Captain . 
It is mutiny -- seizing the transport of one 's own army . 
Our men have had nothing to eat for two days . '' 
`` And mine have had nothing for two weeks , '' said Denisov . 
`` It is robbery ! 
You 'll answer for it , sir ! '' 
said the infantry officer , raising his voice . 
`` Now , what are you pestewing me for ? '' 
cried Denisov , suddenly losing his temper . 
`` I shall answer for it and not you , and you 'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt . 
Be off ! 
Go ! '' 
he shouted at the officers . 
`` Very well , then ! '' 
shouted the little officer , undaunted and not riding away . 
`` If you are determined to rob , I 'll ... '' `` Go to the devil ! 
quick ma ` ch , while you 're safe and sound ! '' 
and Denisov turned his horse on the officer . 
`` Very well , very well ! '' 
muttered the officer , threateningly , and turning his horse he trotted away , jolting in his saddle . 
`` A dog astwide a fence ! 
A weal dog astwide a fence ! '' 
shouted Denisov after him -LRB- the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman -RRB- and riding up to Rostov , he burst out laughing . 
`` I 've taken twansports from the infantwy by force ! '' 
he said . 
`` After all , ca n't let our men starve . '' 
The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment , but learning from Lavrushka that the transport was unescorted , Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force . 
The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely , and they even shared them with the other squadrons . 
The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov , and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said : `` This is how I look at this affair : I know nothing about it and wo n't begin proceedings , but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received . 
If not , as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment , there will be a row and the affair may end badly . '' 
From the regimental commander 's , Denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice . 
In the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in . 
Denisov could not speak and gasped for breath . 
When Rostov asked what was the matter , he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse , feeble voice . 
Alarmed at Denisov 's condition , Rostov suggested that he should undress , drink some water , and send for the doctor . 
`` Twy me for wobbewy ... oh ! 
Some more water ... Let them twy me , but I 'll always thwash scoundwels ... and I 'll tell the Empewo ' ... Ice ... '' he muttered . 
The regimental doctor , when he came , said it was absolutely necessary to bleed Denisov . 
A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him . 
`` I get there , '' began Denisov . '' 
` Now then , where 's your chief 's quarters ? ' 
They were pointed out . 
` Please to wait . ' 
` I 've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait . 
Announce me . ' 
Vewy well , so out comes their head chief -- also took it into his head to lecture me : ` It 's wobbewy ! ' 
-- ` Wobbewy , ' I say , ` is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers , but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets ! ' 
` Will you please be silent ? ' 
` Vewy good ! ' 
Then he says : ` Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner , but your affair will be passed on to headquarters . ' 
I go to the commissioner . 
I enter , and at the table ... who do you think ? 
No , but wait a bit ! 
... Who is it that 's starving us ? '' 
shouted Denisov , hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about . 
`` Telyanin ! 
` What ? 
So it 's you who 's starving us to death ! 
Is it ? 
Take this and this ! ' 
and I hit him so pat , stwaight on his snout ... ` Ah , what a. . . 
what ... ! ' 
and I sta ` ted fwashing him ... Well , I 've had a bit of fun I can tell you ! '' 
cried Denisov , gleeful and yet angry , his showing under his black mustache . 
`` I 'd have killed him if they had n't taken him away ! '' 
`` But what are you shouting for ? 
Calm yourself , '' said Rostov . 
`` You 've set your arm bleeding afresh . 
Wait , we must tie it up again . ''
