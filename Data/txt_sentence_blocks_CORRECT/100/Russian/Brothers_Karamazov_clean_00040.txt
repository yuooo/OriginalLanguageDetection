Ivan , do you love Alyosha ? '' 
`` You must love him '' -LRB- Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk -RRB- . 
`` Listen , Alyosha , I was rude to your elder this morning . 
But I was excited . 
But there 's wit in that elder , do n't you think , Ivan ? '' 
`` Very likely . '' 
`` There is , there is . 
Il y a du Piron la-dedans . 
* He 's a Jesuit , a Russian one , that is . 
As he 's an honourable person there 's a hidden indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness . '' 
* There 's something of Piron inside of him . 
`` But , of course , he believes in God . '' 
`` Not a bit of it . 
Did n't you know ? 
Why , he tells everyone so , himself . 
That is , not everyone , but all the clever people who come to him . 
He said straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago : ` Credo , but I do n't know in what . ' '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` He really did . 
But I respect him . 
There 's something of Mephistopheles about him , or rather of ` The hero of our time ' ... Arbenin , or what 's his name ? 
... You see , he 's a sensualist . 
He 's such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him . 
You know , when he begins telling stories ... The year before last he invited us to tea , tea with liqueur -LRB- the ladies send him liqueur -RRB- , and began telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides ... . 
Especially how he once cured a paralysed woman . 
` If my legs were not bad I know a dance I could dance you , ' he said . 
What do you say to that ? 
` I 've plenty of tricks in my time , ' said he . 
He did Demidov , the merchant , out of sixty thousand . '' 
`` What , he stole it ? '' 
`` He brought him the money as a man he could trust , saying , ` Take care of it for me , friend , there 'll be a police search at my place to-morrow . ' 
And he kept it . 
` You have given it to the Church , ' he declared . 
I said to him : ` You 're a scoundrel , ' I said . 
` No , ' said he , ` I 'm not a scoundrel , but I 'm broadminded . ' 
But that was n't he , that was someone else . 
I 've muddled him with someone else ... without noticing it . 
Come , another glass and that 's enough . 
Take away the bottle , Ivan . 
I 've been telling lies . 
Why did n't you stop me , Ivan , and tell me I was lying ? '' 
`` I knew you 'd stop of yourself . '' 
`` That 's a lie . 
You did it from spite , from simple spite against me . 
You despise me . 
You have come to me and despised me in my own house . '' 
`` Well , I 'm going away . 
You 've had too much brandy . '' 
`` I 've begged you for Christ 's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two , and you do n't go . '' 
`` I 'll go to-morrow if you 're so set upon it . '' 
`` You wo n't go . 
You want to keep an eye on me . 
That 's what you want , spiteful fellow . 
That 's why you wo n't go . '' 
The old man persisted . 
He had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert himself . 
`` Why are you looking at me ? 
Why do you look like that ? 
Your eyes look at me and say , ` You ugly drunkard ! ' 
Your eyes are mistrustful . 
They 're contemptuous ... . 
You 've come here with some design . 
Alyosha , here , looks at me and his eyes shine . 
Alyosha does n't despise me . 
Alexey , you must n't love Ivan . '' 
`` Do n't be ill-tempered with my brother . 
Leave off attacking him , '' Alyosha said emphatically . 
`` Oh , all right . 
Ugh , my head aches . 
Take away the brandy , Ivan . 
It 's the third time I 've told you . '' 
He mused , and suddenly a slow , cunning grin spread over his face . 
`` Do n't be angry with a feeble old man , Ivan . 
I know you do n't love me , but do n't be angry all the same . 
You 've nothing to love me for . 
You go to Tchermashnya . 
I 'll come to you myself and bring you a present . 
I 'll show you a little wench there . 
I 've had my eye on her a long time . 
She 's still running about bare-foot . 
Do n't be afraid of bare-footed wenches - do n't despise them - they 're pearls ! '' 
And he kissed his hand with a smack . 
`` To my thinking , '' he revived at once , seeming to grow sober the instant he touched on his favourite topic . 
`` To my thinking ... Ah , you boys ! 
You children , little sucking-pigs , to my thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life - that 's been my rule ! 
Can you understand that ? 
How could you understand it ? 
You 've milk in your veins , not blood . 
You 're not out of your shells yet . 
My rule has been that you can always find something devilishly interesting in every woman that you would n't find in any other . 
Only , one must know how to find it , that 's the point ! 
That 's a talent ! 
To my mind there are no ugly women . 
The very fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you understand that ? 
Even in vieilles filles , even in them you may discover something that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them . 
Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones , you must take by surprise . 
Did n't you know that ? 
You must astound them till they 're fascinated , upset , ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut . 
It 's a jolly good thing that there always are and will be masters and slaves in the world , so there always will be a little maid-of-all-work and her master , and you know , that 's all that 's needed for happiness . 
Stay ... listen , Alyosha , I always used to surprise your mother , but in a different way .
