`` Now , Alyosha , take a glass , show what you can do ! 
What shall we drink to ? 
The gates of paradise ? 
Take a glass , Grushenka , you drink to the gates of paradise , too . '' 
`` What gates of paradise ? '' 
She took a glass , Alyosha took his , tasted it and put it back . 
`` No , I 'd better not , '' he smiled gently . 
`` And you bragged ! '' 
cried Rakitin . 
`` Well , if so , I wo n't either , '' chimed in Grushenka , `` I really do n't want any . 
You can drink the whole bottle alone , Rakitin . 
If Alyosha has some , I will . '' 
`` What touching sentimentality ! '' 
said Rakitin tauntingly ; `` and she 's sitting on his knee , too ! 
He 's got something to grieve over , but what 's the matter with you ? 
He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat sausage ... '' `` How so ? '' 
`` His elder died to-day , Father Zossima , the saint . '' 
`` So Father Zossima is dead , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` Good God , I did not know ! '' 
She crossed herself devoutly . 
`` Goodness , what have I been doing , sitting on his knee like this at such a moment ! 
She started up as though in dismay , instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa . 
Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in his face . 
`` Rakitin , '' he said suddenly , in a firm and loud voice ; `` do n't taunt me with having rebelled against God . 
I do n't want to feel angry with you , so you must be kinder , too ; I 've lost a treasure such as you have never had , and you can not judge me now . 
You had much better look at her - do you see how she has pity on me ? 
I came here to find a wicked soul - I felt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself , and I 've found a true sister ; I have found a treasure - a loving heart . 
She had pity on me just now ... . 
Agrafena Alexandrovna , I am speaking of you . 
You 've raised my soul from the depths . '' 
Alyosha 's lips were quivering and he caught his breath . 
`` She has saved you , it seems , '' laughed Rakitin spitefully . 
`` And she meant to get you in her clutches , do your realise that ? '' 
`` Stay , Rakitin . '' 
Grushenka jumped up . 
`` Hush , both of you . 
Now I 'll tell you all about it . 
Hush , Alyosha , your words make me ashamed , for I am bad and not good - that 's what I am . 
And you hush , Rakitin , because you are telling lies . 
I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches , but now you are lying , now it 's all different . 
And do n't let me hear anything more from you , Rakitin . '' 
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion . 
`` They are both crazy , '' said Rakitin , looking at them with amazement . 
`` I feel as though I were in a madhouse . 
They 're both getting so feeble they 'll begin crying in a minute . '' 
`` I shall begin to cry , I shall , '' repeated Grushenka . 
`` He called me his sister and I shall never forget that . 
Only let me tell you , Rakitin , though I am bad , I did give away an onion . '' 
`` An onion ? 
Hang it all , you really are crazy . '' 
Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm . 
He was aggrieved and annoyed , though he might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime . 
But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself , he was very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others - partly from his youth and inexperience , partly from his intense egoism . 
`` You see , Alyosha , '' Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh . 
`` I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion , but it 's not to boast I tell you about it . 
It 's only a story , but it 's a nice story . 
I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona , my cook , who is still with me . 
It 's like this . 
Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she was . 
And she died and did not leave a single good deed behind . 
The devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire . 
So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember to tell to God ; ` She once pulled up an onion in her garden , ' said he , ` and gave it to a beggar woman . ' 
And God answered : ` You take that onion then , hold it out to her in the lake , and let her take hold and be pulled out . 
And if you can pull her out of the lake , let her come to Paradise , but if the onion breaks , then the woman must stay where she is . ' 
The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her . 
` Come , ' said he , ` catch hold and I 'll pull you out . ' 
he began cautiously pulling her out . 
He had just pulled her right out , when the other sinners in the lake , seeing how she was being drawn out , began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her . 
But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them . 
` I 'm to be pulled out , not you . 
It 's my onion , not yours . ' 
As soon as she said that , the onion broke . 
And the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day . 
So the angel wept and went away . 
So that 's the story , Alyosha ; I know it by heart , for I am that wicked woman myself . 
I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion , but to you I 'll say : ` I 've done nothing but give away one onion all my life , that 's the only good deed I 've done . ' 
do n't praise me , Alyosha , do n't think me good , I am bad , I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise me . 
Eh , I must confess everything . 
Listen , Alyosha . 
I was so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he would bring you to me . 
Stay , Rakitin , wait ! '' 
She went with rapid steps to the table , opened a drawer , pulled out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note . 
`` What nonsense ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
cried Rakitin , disconcerted . 
`` Take it . 
Rakitin , I owe it you , there 's no fear of your refusing it , you asked for it yourself . '' 
And she threw the note to him . 
`` Likely I should refuse it , '' boomed Rakitin , obviously abashed , but carrying off his confusion with a swagger . 
`` That will come in very handy ; fools are made for wise men 's profit . '' 
`` And now hold your tongue , Rakitin , what I am going to say now is not for your ears . 
Sit down in that corner and keep quiet . 
You do n't like us , so hold your tongue . '' 
`` What should I like you for ? '' 
Rakitin snarled , not concealing his ill-humour . 
He put the twenty-five rouble note in his pocket and he felt ashamed at Alyosha 's seeing it . 
He had reckoned on receiving his payment later , without Alyosha 's knowing of it , and now , feeling ashamed , he lost his temper . 
Till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing , since he had something to get out of her . 
But now he , too , was angry : `` One loves people for some reason , but what have either of you done for me ? '' 
`` You should love people without a reason , as Alyosha does . ''
