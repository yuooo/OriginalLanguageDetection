At last , however , he began brooding over the past , and the strain of it was too much for him . 
Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl and soon after married her , hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely depression , and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children , he would escape from old memories altogether . 
But the very opposite of what he expected happened . 
He began , even in the first month of his marriage , to be continually fretted by the thought , `` My wife loves me - but what if she knew ? '' 
When she first told him that she would soon bear him a child , he was troubled . 
`` I am giving life , but I have taken life . '' 
Children came . 
`` How dare I love them , teach and educate them , how can I talk to them of virtue ? 
I have shed blood . '' 
They were splendid children , he longed to caress them ; `` and I ca n't look at their innocent candid faces , I am unworthy . '' 
At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim , by the young life he had destroyed , by the blood that cried out for vengeance . 
He had begun to have awful dreams . 
But , being a man of fortitude , he bore his suffering a long time , thinking : `` I shall expiate everything by this secret agony . '' 
But that hope , too , was vain ; the longer it went on , the more intense was his suffering . 
He was respected in society for his active benevolence , though everyone was overawed by his stern and gloomy character . 
But the more he was respected , the more intolerable it was for him . 
He confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself . 
But he began to be haunted by another idea - an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable , though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off . 
He dreamed of rising up , going out and confessing in the face of all men that he had committed murder . 
For three years this dream had pursued him , haunting him in different forms . 
At last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed his crime , he would heal his soul and would be at peace for ever . 
But this belief filled his heart with terror , for how could he carry it out ? 
And then came what happened at my duel . 
`` Looking at you , I have made up my mind . '' 
I looked at him . 
`` Is it possible , '' I cried , clasping my hands , `` that such a trivial incident could give rise to a resolution in you ? '' 
`` My resolution has been growing for the last three years , '' he answered , `` and your story only gave the last touch to it . 
Looking at you , I reproached myself and envied you . '' 
He said this to me almost sullenly . 
`` But you wo n't be believed , '' I observed ; `` it 's fourteen years ago . '' 
`` I have proofs , great proofs . 
I shall show them . '' 
Then I cried and kissed him . 
`` Tell me one thing , one thing , '' he said -LRB- as though it all depended upon me -RRB- , `` my wife , my children ! 
My wife may die of grief , and though my children wo n't lose their rank and property , they 'll be a convict 's children and for ever ! 
And what a memory , what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts ! '' 
I said nothing . 
`` And to part from them , to leave them for ever ? 
It 's for ever , you know , for ever ! '' 
I sat still and repeated a silent prayer . 
I got up at last , I felt afraid . 
`` Well ? '' 
He looked at me . 
`` Go ! '' 
said I , `` confess . 
Everything passes , only the truth remains . 
Your children will understand , when they grow up , the nobility of your resolution . '' 
He left me that time as though he had made up his mind . 
Yet for more than a fortnight afterwards , he came to me every evening , still preparing himself , still unable to bring himself to the point . 
He made my heart ache . 
One day he would come determined and say fervently : `` I know it will be heaven for me , heaven , the moment I confess . 
Fourteen years I 've been in hell . 
I want to suffer . 
I will take my punishment and begin to live . 
You can pass through the world doing wrong , but there 's no turning back . 
Now I dare not love my neighbour nor even my own children . 
Good God , my children will understand , perhaps , what my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me ! 
God is not in strength but in truth . '' 
`` All will understand your sacrifice , '' I said to him , `` if not at once , they will understand later ; for you have served truth , the higher truth , not of the earth . '' 
And he would go away seeming comforted , but next day he would come again , bitter , pale , sarcastic . 
`` Every time I come to you , you look at me so inquisitively as though to say , ` He has still not confessed ! ' 
Wait a bit , do n't despise me too much . 
It 's not such an easy thing to do as you would think . 
Perhaps I shall not do it at all . 
You wo n't go and inform against me then , will you ? '' 
And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity , I was afraid to look at him at all . 
I was quite ill from anxiety , and my heart was full of tears . 
I could not sleep at night . 
`` I have just come from my wife , '' he went on . 
`` Do you understand what the word ` wife ' means ? 
When I went out , the children called to me , ` Good-bye , father , make haste back to read The Children 's Magazine with us . ' 
No , you do n't understand that ! 
No one is wise from another man 's woe . '' 
His eyes were glittering , his lips were twitching . 
Suddenly he struck the table with his fist so that everything on it danced - it was the first time he had done such a thing , he was such a mild man . 
`` But need I ? '' 
he exclaimed , `` must I ? 
No one has been condemned , no one has been sent to Siberia in my place , the man died of fever . 
And I 've been punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed . 
And I sha n't be believed , they wo n't believe my proofs . 
Need I confess , need I ? 
I am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I have shed , if only my wife and children may be spared . 
Will it be just to ruin them with me ? 
Are n't we making a mistake ? 
What is right in this case ? 
And will people recognise it , will they appreciate it , will they respect it ? '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
I thought to myself , `` he is thinking of other people 's respect at such a moment ! '' 
And I felt so sorry for him then , that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him . 
I saw he was beside himself . 
I was aghast , realising with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant . 
`` Decide my fate ! '' 
he exclaimed again . 
`` Go and confess , '' I whispered to him . 
My voice failed me , but I whispered it firmly . 
I took up the New Testament from the table , the Russian translation , and showed him the Gospel of St. John , chapter 12 , verse 24 : `` Verily , verily , I say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . '' 
I had just been reading that verse when he came in . 
He read it . 
`` That 's true , '' he said , he smiled bitterly . 
`` It 's terrible the things you find in those books , '' he said , after a pause .
