* `` Think it over ; get into the barque , and take care not to make it a barque of Charon . '' 
`` You do n't spare anyone , '' said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin , beringed fingers . 
Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree . 
`` Bezukhov est ridicule , but he is so kind and good-natured . 
What pleasure is there to be so caustique ? '' 
`` A forfeit ! '' 
cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called `` mon chevalier , '' and who was going with her to Nizhni . 
In Julie 's set , as in many other circles in Moscow , it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary Contributions . 
`` Another forfeit for a Gallicism , '' said a Russian writer who was present . '' 
` What pleasure is there to be ' is not Russian ! '' 
`` You spare no one , '' continued Julie to the young man without heeding the author 's remark . 
`` For caustique -- I am guilty and will pay , and I am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth . 
For Gallicisms I wo n't be responsible , '' she remarked , turning to the author : `` I have neither the money nor the time , like Prince Galitsyn , to engage a master to teach me Russian ! '' 
`` Ah , here he is ! '' 
she added . 
`` Quand on ... No , no , '' she said to the militia officer , `` you wo n't catch me . 
Speak of the sun and you see its rays ! '' 
and she smiled amiably at Pierre . 
`` We were just talking of you , '' she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman . 
`` We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamonov 's . '' 
`` Oh , do n't talk to me of my regiment , '' replied Pierre , kissing his hostess ' hand and taking a seat beside her . 
`` I am so sick of it . '' 
`` You will , of course , command it yourself ? '' 
said Julie , directing a sly , sarcastic glance toward the militia officer . 
The latter in Pierre 's presence had ceased to be caustic , and his face expressed perplexity as to what Julie 's smile might mean . 
In spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature , Pierre 's personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face . 
`` No , '' said Pierre , with a laughing glance at his big , stout body . 
`` I should make too good a target for the French , besides I am afraid I should hardly be able to climb onto a horse . '' 
Among those whom Julie 's guests happened to choose to gossip about were the Rostovs . 
`` I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way , '' said Julie . 
`` And he is so unreasonable , the count himself I mean . 
The Razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near Moscow , but it drags on and on . 
He asks too much . '' 
`` No , I think the sale will come off in a few days , '' said someone . 
`` Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked Julie . 
`` You do n't think Moscow is in danger ? '' 
`` Then why are you leaving ? '' 
`` I ? 
What a question ! 
I am going because ... well , because everyone is going : and besides -- I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon . '' 
`` Well , of course , of course ! 
Let me have some more strips of linen . '' 
`` If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts , '' said the militia officer , speaking of Rostov . 
`` A kindly old man but not up to much . 
And why do they stay on so long in Moscow ? 
They meant to leave for the country long ago . 
Natalie is quite well again now , is n't she ? '' 
Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile . 
`` They are waiting for their younger son , '' Pierre replied . 
`` He joined Obolenski 's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment is being formed . 
But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day . 
The count wanted to leave long ago , but the countess wo n't on any account leave Moscow till her son returns . '' 
`` I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs ' . 
Natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter . 
She sang a song . 
How easily some people get over everything ! '' 
`` Get over what ? '' 
inquired Pierre , looking displeased . 
Julie smiled . 
`` You know , Count , such knights as you are only found in Madame de Souza 's novels . '' 
`` What knights ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
demanded Pierre , blushing . 
`` Oh , come , my dear count ! 
C'est la fable de tout Moscou . 
Je vous admire , ma parole d'honneur ! '' 
* * `` It is the talk of all Moscow . 
My word , I admire you ! '' 
`` Forfeit , forfeit ! '' 
cried the militia officer . 
`` All right , one ca n't talk -- how tiresome ! '' 
`` What is ` the talk of all Moscow ' ? '' 
Pierre asked angrily , rising to his feet . 
`` Come now , Count , you know ! '' 
`` I do n't know anything about it , '' said Pierre . 
`` I know you were friendly with Natalie , and so ... but I was always more friendly with Vera -- that dear Vera . '' 
`` No , madame ! '' 
Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure , `` I have not taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova 's knight at all , and have not been their house for nearly a month . 
But I can not understand the cruelty ... '' `` Qui s ` excuse s ` accuse , '' * said Julie , smiling and waving the lint triumphantly , and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject . 
`` Do you know what I heard today ? 
Poor Mary Bolkonskaya arrived in Moscow yesterday . 
Do you know that she has lost her father ? '' 
* `` Who excuses himself , accuses himself . '' 
`` Really ? 
Where is she ? 
I should like very much to see her , '' said Pierre . 
`` I spent the evening with her yesterday . 
She is going to their estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning , with her nephew . '' 
`` Well , and how is she ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` She is well , but sad . 
But do you know who rescued her ? 
It is quite a romance . 
Nicholas Rostov ! 
She was surrounded , and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people . 
He rushed in and saved her ... '' `` Another romance , '' said the militia officer . 
`` Really , this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off . 
Catiche is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another . ''
