Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking smile . 
`` What if I wo n't tell you ? 
From whom could you find out ? 
No one knew about the signals except my father , Smerdyakov , and me : that was all . 
Heaven knew , too , but it wo n't tell you . 
But it 's an interesting fact . 
There 's no knowing what you might build on it . 
Ha ha ! 
Take comfort , gentlemen , I 'll reveal it . 
You 've some foolish idea in your hearts . 
You do n't know the man you have to deal with ! 
You have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence against himself , to his own damage ! 
Yes , for I 'm a man of honour and you - are not . '' 
The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur . 
He was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact . 
Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov . 
He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant , tapped the signals on the table , and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed he , Mitya , had tapped the signal `` Grushenka has come , '' when he tapped to his father , he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal , that `` Grushenka had come . '' 
`` So now you can build up your tower , '' Mitya broke off , and again turned away from them contemptuously . 
`` So no one knew of the signals but your dead father , you , and the valet Smerdyakov ? 
And no one else ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more . 
`` Yes . 
The valet Smerdyakov , and Heaven . 
Write down about Heaven . 
That may be of use . 
Besides , you will need God yourselves . '' 
And they had already of course , begun writing it down . 
But while they wrote , the prosecutor said suddenly , as though pitching on a new idea : `` But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all responsibility for the death of your father , was it not he , perhaps , who knocked the signal agreed upon , induced your father to open to him , and then ... committed the crime ? '' 
Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred . 
His silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink . 
`` You 've caught the fox again , '' commented Mitya at last ; `` you 've got the beast by the tail . 
Ha ha ! 
I see through you , Mr. Prosecutor . 
You thought , of course , that I should jump at that , catch at your prompting , and shout with all my might , ` Aie ! 
it 's Smerdyakov ; he 's the murderer . ' 
Confess that 's what you thought . 
Confess , and I 'll go on . '' 
But the prosecutor did not confess . 
He held his tongue and waited . 
`` You 're mistaken . 
I 'm not going to shout , ` It 's Smerdyakov , ' '' said Mitya . 
`` And you do n't even suspect him ? '' 
`` Why , do you suspect him ? '' 
`` He is suspected , too . '' 
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor . 
`` Joking apart , '' he brought out gloomily . 
`` Listen . 
From the very beginning , almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain , I 've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind . 
I 've been sitting here , shouting that I 'm innocent and thinking all the time ` Smerdyakov ! ' 
I ca n't get Smerdyakov out of my head . 
In fact , I , too , thought of Smerdyakov just now ; but only for a second . 
Almost at once I thought , ` No , it 's not Smerdyakov . ' 
It 's not his doing , gentlemen . '' 
`` In that case is there anybody else you suspect ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously . 
`` I do n't know anyone it could be , whether it 's the hand of Heaven or of Satan , but ... not Smerdyakov , '' Mitya jerked out with decision . 
`` But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it 's not he ? '' 
`` From my conviction - my impression . 
Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward . 
He 's not a coward , he 's the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs . 
He has the heart of a chicken . 
When he talked to me , he was always trembling for fear I should kill him , though I never raised my hand against him . 
He fell at my feet and blubbered ; he has kissed these very boots , literally , beseeching me ` not to frighten him . ' 
Do you hear ? 
` Not to frighten him . ' 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , I offered him money . 
He 's a puling chicken - sickly , epileptic , weak-minded - a child of eight could thrash him . 
He has no character worth talking about . 
It 's not Smerdyakov , gentlemen . 
He does n't care for money ; he would n't take my presents . 
Besides , what motive had he for murdering the old man ? 
Why , he 's very likely his son , you know - his natural son . 
Do you know that ? '' 
`` We have heard that legend . 
But you are your father 's son , too , you know ; yet you yourself told everyone you meant to murder him . '' 
`` That 's a thrust ! 
And a nasty , mean one , too ! 
I 'm not afraid ! 
Oh , gentlemen , is n't it too base of you to say that to my face ? 
It 's base , because I told you that myself . 
I not only wanted to murder him , but I might have done it . 
And , what 's more , I went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him . 
But , you see , I did n't murder him ; you see , my guardian angel saved me - that 's what you 've not taken into account . 
And that 's why it 's so base of you . 
For I did n't kill him , I did n't kill him ! 
Do you hear , I did not kill him . '' 
He was almost choking . 
He had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation . 
`` And what has he told you , gentlemen - Smerdyakov , I mean ? '' 
he added suddenly , after a pause . 
`` May I ask that question ? '' 
`` You may ask any question , '' the prosecutor replied with frigid severity , `` any question relating to the facts of the case , and we are , I repeat , bound to answer every inquiry you make . 
We found the servant Smerdyakov , concerning whom you inquire , lying unconscious in his bed , in an epileptic fit of extreme severity , that had recurred , possibly , ten times . 
The doctor who was with us told us , after seeing him , that he may possibly not outlive the night . '' 
`` Well , if that 's so , the devil must have killed him , '' broke suddenly from Mitya , as though until that moment had been asking himself : `` Was it Smerdyakov or not ? '' 
`` We will come back to this later , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch decided . 
`` Now would n't you like to continue your statement ? '' 
Mitya asked for a rest . 
His request was courteously granted .
