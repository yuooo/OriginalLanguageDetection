asked Natasha , suddenly beaming all over with joy . 
`` Oh , how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows ! 
... Natasha -- are you glad ? '' 
`` I am so glad , so glad ! 
I was beginning to be vexed with you . 
I did not tell you , but you have been treating her badly . 
What a heart she has , Nicholas ! 
I am horrid sometimes , but I was ashamed to be happy while Sonya was not , '' continued Natasha . 
`` Now I am so glad ! 
Well , run back to her . '' 
`` No , wait a bit ... . 
Oh , how funny you look ! '' 
cried Nicholas , peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new , unusual , and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before . 
`` Natasha , it 's magical , is n't it ? '' 
`` Yes , '' she replied . 
`` You have done splendidly . '' 
`` Had I seen her before as she is now , '' thought Nicholas , `` I should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me , and all would have been well . '' 
`` So you are glad and I have done right ? '' 
`` Oh , quite right ! 
I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it . 
Mamma said she was angling for you . 
How could she say such a thing ! 
I nearly stormed at Mamma . 
I will never let anyone say anything bad of Sonya , for there is nothing but good in her . '' 
`` Then it 's all right ? '' 
said Nicholas , again scrutinizing the expression of his sister 's face to see if she was in earnest . 
Then he jumped down and , his boots scrunching the snow , ran back to his sleigh . 
The same happy , smiling Circassian , with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood , was still sitting there , and that Circassian was Sonya , and that Sonya was certainly his future happy and loving wife . 
When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the Melyukovs ' , the girls went to their bedroom . 
When they had undressed , but without washing off the cork mustaches , they sat a long time talking of their happiness . 
They talked of how they would live when they were married , how their husbands would be friends , and how happy they would be . 
On Natasha 's table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared beforehand . 
`` Only when will all that be ? 
I am afraid never ... . 
It would be too good ! '' 
said Natasha , rising and going to the looking glasses . 
`` Sit down , Natasha ; perhaps you 'll see him , '' said Sonya . 
Natasha lit the candles , one on each side of one of the looking glasses , and sat down . 
`` I see someone with a mustache , '' said Natasha , seeing her own face . 
`` You must n't laugh , Miss , '' said Dunyasha . 
With Sonya 's help and the maid 's , Natasha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other ; her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent . 
She sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting -LRB- from tales she had heard -RRB- to see a coffin , or him , Prince Andrew , in that last dim , indistinctly outlined square . 
But ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin , she saw nothing . 
She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses . 
`` Why is it others see things and I do n't ? '' 
she said . 
`` You sit down now , Sonya . 
You absolutely must , tonight ! 
Do it for me ... . 
Today I feel so frightened ! '' 
Sonya sat down before the glasses , got the right position , and began looking . 
`` Now , Miss Sonya is sure to see something , '' whispered Dunyasha ; `` while you do nothing but laugh . '' 
Sonya heard this and Natasha 's whisper : `` I know she will . 
She saw something last year . '' 
For about three minutes all were silent . 
`` Of course she will ! '' 
whispered Natasha , but did not finish ... suddenly Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her hand . 
`` Oh , Natasha ! '' 
she cried . 
`` Did you see ? 
Did you ? 
What was it ? '' 
exclaimed Natasha , holding up the looking glass . 
Sonya had not seen anything , she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard Natasha say , `` Of course she will ! '' 
She did not wish to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha , but it was hard to sit still . 
She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes . 
`` You saw him ? '' 
urged Natasha , seizing her hand . 
`` Yes . 
Wait a bit ... I. . . 
saw him , '' Sonya could not help saying , not yet knowing whom Natasha meant by him , Nicholas or Prince Andrew . 
`` But why should n't I say I saw something ? 
Others do see ! 
Besides who can tell whether I saw anything or not ? '' 
flashed through Sonya 's mind . 
`` Yes , I saw him , '' she said . 
`` How ? 
Standing or lying ? '' 
`` No , I saw ... At first there was nothing , then I saw him lying down . '' 
`` Andrew lying ? 
Is he ill ? '' 
asked Natasha , her frightened eyes fixed on her friend . 
`` No , on the contrary , on the contrary ! 
His face was cheerful , and he turned to me . '' 
And when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen what she described . 
`` Well , and then , Sonya ? 
... '' `` After that , I could not make out what there was ; something blue and red ... '' `` Sonya ! 
When will he come back ? 
When shall I see him ! 
O , God , how afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything ! 
... '' Natasha began , and without replying to Sonya 's words of comfort she got into bed , and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless , gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes . 
Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her . 
The countess , who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration , listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased , but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage . 
Nicholas , for the first time , felt that his mother was displeased with him and that , despite her love for him , she would not give way . 
Coldly , without looking at her son , she sent for her husband and , when he came , tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts , in her son 's presence , but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room . 
The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose . 
Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word , and his father , sighing and evidently disconcerted , very soon became silent and went in to the countess . 
In all his encounters with his son , the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune , and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya . 
On this occasion , he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder , no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could have been wished for , and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances . 
The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again , but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and , with a cruelty neither of them expected , reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and for ingratitude .
