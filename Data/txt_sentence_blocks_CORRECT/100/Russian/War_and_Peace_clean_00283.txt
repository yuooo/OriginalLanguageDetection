He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman 's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head . 
He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room , and without greeting anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand . 
Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport , of the message Petya had brought , and his own replies to both generals . 
Then he told him all he knew of the French detachment . 
`` That 's so . 
But we must know what troops they are and their numbers , '' said Dolokhov . 
`` It will be necessary to go there . 
We ca n't start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are . 
I like to work accurately . 
Here now -- would n't one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the French camp with me ? 
I have brought a spare uniform . '' 
`` I , I. . . 
I 'll go with you ! '' 
cried Petya . 
`` There 's no need for you to go at all , '' said Denisov , addressing Dolokhov , `` and as for him , I wo n't let him go on any account . '' 
`` I like that ! '' 
exclaimed Petya . 
`` Why should n't I go ? '' 
`` Because it 's useless . '' 
`` Well , you must excuse me , because ... because ... I shall go , and that 's all . 
You 'll take me , wo n't you ? '' 
he said , turning to Dolokhov . 
`` Why not ? '' 
Dolokhov answered absently , scrutinizing the face of the French drummer boy . 
`` Have you had that youngster with you long ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He was taken today but he knows nothing . 
I 'm keeping him with me . '' 
`` Yes , and where do you put the others ? '' 
inquired Dolokhov . 
`` Where ? 
I send them away and take a weceipt for them , '' shouted Denisov , suddenly flushing . 
`` And I say boldly that I have not a single man 's life on my conscience . 
Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort , instead of staining - I speak bluntly -- staining the honor of a soldier ? '' 
`` That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen , '' said Dolokhov with cold irony , `` but it 's time for you to drop it . '' 
`` Why , I 've not said anything ! 
I only say that I 'll certainly go with you , '' said Petya shyly . 
`` But for you and me , old fellow , it 's time to drop these amenities , '' continued Dolokhov , as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated Denisov . 
`` Now , why have you kept this lad ? '' 
he went on , swaying his head . 
`` Because you are sorry for him ! 
Do n't we know those ` receipts ' of yours ? 
You send a hundred men away , and thirty get there . 
The rest either starve or get killed . 
So is n't it all the same not to send them ? '' 
The esaul , screwing up his light-colored eyes , nodded approvingly . 
`` That 's not the point . 
I 'm not going to discuss the matter . 
I do not wish to take it on my conscience . 
You say they 'll die . 
All wight . 
Only not by my fault ! '' 
Dolokhov began laughing . 
`` Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over ? 
But if they did catch me they 'd string me up to an aspen tree , and with all your chivalry just the same . '' 
He paused . 
`` However , we must get to work . 
Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit . 
I have two French uniforms in it . 
Well , are you coming with me ? '' 
he asked Petya . 
`` I ? 
Yes , yes , certainly ! '' 
cried Petya , blushing almost to tears and glancing at Denisov . 
While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done with prisoners , Petya had once more felt awkward and restless ; but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about . 
`` If grown-up , distinguished men think so , it must be necessary and right , '' thought he . 
`` But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine that I 'll obey him and that he can order me about . 
I will certainly go to the French camp with Dolokhov . 
If he can , so can I ! '' 
And to all Denisov 's persuasions , Petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow , and that he never considered personal danger . 
`` For you 'll admit that if we do n't know for sure how many of them there are ... hundreds of lives may depend on it , while there are only two of us . 
Besides , I want to go very much and certainly will go , so do n't hinder me , '' said he . 
`` It will only make things worse ... '' Having put on French greatcoats and shakos , Petya and Dolokhov rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French camp , and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow . 
On reaching the bottom , Dolokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge . 
Petya , his heart in his mouth with excitement , rode by his side . 
`` If we 're caught , I wo n't be taken alive ! 
I have a pistol , '' whispered he . 
`` Do n't talk Russian , '' said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper , and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge : `` Qui vive ? '' 
* and the click of a musket . 
* `` Who goes there ? '' 
The blood rushed to Petya 's face and he grasped his pistol . 
`` Lanciers du 6-me , '' * replied Dolokhov , neither hastening nor slackening his horse 's pace . 
* `` Lancers of the 6th Regiment . '' 
The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge . 
`` Mot d'ordre . '' 
* * `` Password . '' 
Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk . 
`` Dites donc , le colonel Gerard est ici ? '' 
* he asked . 
* `` Tell me , is Colonel Gerard here ? '' 
`` Mot d'ordre , '' repeated the sentinel , barring the way and not replying . 
`` Quand un officier fait sa ronde , les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre ... '' cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel . 
`` Je vous demande si le colonel est ici . '' 
* * `` When an officer is making his round , sentinels do n't ask him for the password ... . 
I am asking you if the colonel is here . '' 
And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel , who had stepped aside , Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk . 
Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road , Dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were . 
The man , a soldier with a sack over his shoulder , stopped , came close up to Dolokhov 's horse , touched it with his hand , and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm , as he called the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden up the road , on both sides of which French talk could be heard around the campfires , Dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden in , he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire , around which sat several men talking noisily .
