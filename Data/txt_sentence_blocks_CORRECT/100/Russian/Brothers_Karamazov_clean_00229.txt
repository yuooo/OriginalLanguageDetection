` It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about . ' 
` And do you remember that clearly ? ' 
` No , I do n't . ' 
And he was angry , very angry , and yet imagine not remembering it ! 
At the most terrible moments of man 's life , for instance when he is being led to execution , he remembers just such trifles . 
He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed past him on the road , or a jackdaw on a cross - that he will remember . 
He concealed the making of that little bag from his household , he must have remembered his humiliating fear that someone might come in and find him needle in hand , how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen -LRB- there is a screen in his lodgings -RRB- . 
`` But , gentlemen of the jury , why do I tell you all this , all these details , trifles ? '' 
cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly . 
`` Just because the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment . 
He has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago , he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements ; all those are trivialities . 
` You must believe it on my honour . ' 
Oh , we are glad to believe it , we are eager to believe it , even if only on his word of honour ! 
Are we jackals thirsting for human blood ? 
Show us a single fact in the prisoner 's favour and we shall rejoice ; but let it be a substantial , real fact , and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner 's expression by his own brother , or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to the little bag , in the darkness , too . 
We shall rejoice at the new fact , we shall be the first to repudiate our charge , we shall hasten to repudiate it . 
But now justice cries out and we persist , we can not repudiate anything . '' 
Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration . 
He looked as though he was in a fever , he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance , the blood of the father murdered by his son , with the base motive of robbery ! 
He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts . 
`` And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defence , '' Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding , `` whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities , remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice . 
Remember that you are the champions of our justice , the champions of our holy Russia , of her principles , her family , everything that she holds sacred ! 
Yes , you represent Russia here at this moment , and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will re-echo throughout the whole of Russia , and all Russia will hear you , as her champions and her judges , and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict . 
Do not disappoint Russia and her expectations . 
Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course . 
And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be , not from respect , as the poet would fain believe , but simply from horror . 
From horror , perhaps from disgust . 
And well it is that they stand aside , but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness , for the sake of their own safety , enlightenment and civilisation . 
Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe , they already begin to sound . 
Do not tempt them ! 
Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son I Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved , he wound up his speech with this rhetorical appeal - and the effect produced by him was extraordinary . 
When he had finished his speech , he went out hurriedly and , as I have mentioned before , almost fainted in the adjoining room . 
There was no applause in the court , but serious persons were pleased . 
The ladies were not so well satisfied , though even they were pleased with his eloquence , especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch . 
`` He will speak at last and of course carry all before him . '' 
Everyone looked at Mitya ; he sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor 's speech , clenching his teeth , with his hands clasped , and his head bowed . 
Only from time to time he raised his head and listened , especially when Grushenka was spoken of . 
When the prosecutor mentioned Rakitin 's opinion of her , a smile of contempt and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly , `` The Bernards ! '' 
When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at Mokroe , Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity . 
At one point he seemed about to jump up and cry out , but controlled himself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully . 
People talked afterwards of the end of the speech , of the prosecutor 's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe , and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch . 
`` The man could not resist boasting of his cleverness , '' they said . 
The court was adjourned , but only for a short interval , a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most . 
There was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience . 
I remember some of them . 
`` A weighty speech , '' a gentleman in one group observed gravely . 
`` He brought in too much psychology , '' said another voice . 
`` But it was all true , the absolute truth ! '' 
`` Yes , he is first rate at it . '' 
`` He summed it all up . '' 
`` Yes , he summed us up , too , '' chimed in another voice , `` Do you remember , at the beginning of his speech , making out we were all like Fyodor Pavlovitch ? '' 
`` And at the end , too . 
But that was all rot . '' 
`` And obscure too . '' 
`` He was a little too much carried away . '' 
`` It 's unjust , it 's unjust . '' 
`` No , it was smartly done , anyway . 
He 's had long to wait , but he 's had his say , ha ha ! '' 
`` What will the counsel for the defence say ? '' 
In another group I heard : `` He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that ; ` appealing to your sensibilities ' - do you remember ? '' 
`` Yes , that was awkward of him . '' 
`` He was in too great a hurry . '' 
`` He is a nervous man . '' 
`` We laugh , but what must the prisoner be feeling ? '' 
`` Yes , what must it be for Mitya ? '' 
In a third group : `` What lady is that , the fat one , with the lorgnette , sitting at the end ? '' 
`` She is a general 's wife , divorced , I know her . '' 
`` That 's why she has the lorgnette . '' 
`` She is not good for much . '' 
`` Oh no , she is a piquante little woman . '' 
`` Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman , she is prettier . '' 
`` They caught him smartly at Mokroe , did n't they , eh ? '' 
`` Oh , it was smart enough . 
We 've heard it before , how often he has told the story at people 's houses ! 
`` And he could n't resist doing it now . 
That 's vanity . '' 
`` He is a man with a grievance , he he ! '' 
`` Yes , and quick to take offence . 
And there was too much rhetoric , such long sentences . '' 
`` Yes , he tries to alarm us , he kept trying to alarm us . 
Do you remember about the troika ? 
Something about ` They have Hamlets , but we have , so far , only Karamazovs ! ' 
That was cleverly said ! '' 
`` That was to propitiate the liberals . 
He is afraid of them . '' 
`` Yes , and he is afraid of the lawyer , too . '' 
`` Yes , what will Fetyukovitch say ? '' 
`` Whatever he says , he wo n't get round our peasants . '' 
`` Do n't you think so ? '' 
A fourth group : `` What he said about the troika was good , that piece about the other nations . '' 
`` And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Why , in the English Parliment a Member got up last week and speaking about the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to intervene , to educate this barbarous people . 
Ippolit was thinking of him , I know he was . 
He was talking about that last week . '' 
`` Not an easy job . '' 
`` Not an easy job ? 
Why not ? '' 
`` Why , we 'd shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn . 
Where would they get it ? ''
