Among these folk , too , there are good men as well as bad , '' said he , and still speaking , he turned on his knees with a supple movement , got up , coughed , and went off to another part of the shed . 
`` Eh , you rascal ! '' 
Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed . 
`` So you 've come , you rascal ? 
She remembers ... Now , now , that 'll do ! '' 
And the soldier , pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him , returned to his place and sat down . 
In his hands he had something wrapped in a rag . 
`` Here , eat a bit , sir , '' said he , resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes . 
`` We had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand ! '' 
Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him . 
He thanked the soldier and began to eat . 
`` Well , are they all right ? '' 
said the soldier with a smile . 
`` You should do like this . '' 
He took a potato , drew out his clasp knife , cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand , sprinkled some salt on it from the rag , and handed it to Pierre . 
`` The potatoes are grand ! '' 
he said once more . 
`` Eat some like that ! '' 
Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better . 
`` Oh , I 'm all right , '' said he , `` but why did they shoot those poor fellows ? 
The last one was hardly twenty . '' 
`` Tss , tt ... ! '' 
said the little man . 
`` Ah , what a sin ... what a sin ! '' 
he added quickly , and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on : `` How was it , sir , that you stayed in Moscow ? '' 
`` I did n't think they would come so soon . 
I stayed accidentally , '' replied Pierre . 
`` And how did they arrest you , dear lad ? 
At your house ? '' 
`` No , I went to look at the fire , and they arrested me there , and tried me as an incendiary . '' 
`` Where there 's law there 's injustice , '' put in the little man . 
`` And have you been here long ? '' 
Pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato . 
`` I ? 
It was last Sunday they took me , out of a hospital in Moscow . '' 
`` Why , are you a soldier then ? '' 
`` Yes , we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment . 
I was dying of fever . 
We were n't told anything . 
There were some twenty of us lying there . 
We had no idea , never guessed at all . '' 
`` And do you feel sad here ? '' 
Pierre inquired . 
`` How can one help it , lad ? 
My name is Platon , and the surname is Karataev , '' he added , evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to address him . 
`` They call me ` little falcon ' in the regiment . 
How is one to help feeling sad ? 
Moscow -- she 's the mother of cities . 
How can one see all this and not feel sad ? 
But ` the maggot gnaws the cabbage , yet dies first ' ; that 's what the old folks used to tell us , '' he added rapidly . 
`` What ? 
What did you say ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` Who ? 
I ? '' 
said Karataev . 
`` I say things happen not as we plan but as God judges , '' he replied , thinking that he was repeating what he had said before , and immediately continued : `` Well , and you , have you a family estate , sir ? 
And a house ? 
So you have abundance , then ? 
And a housewife ? 
And your old parents , are they still living ? '' 
he asked . 
And though it was too dark for Pierre to see , he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier 's lips as he put these questions . 
He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents , especially that he had no mother . 
`` A wife for counsel , a mother-in-law for welcome , but there 's none as dear as one 's own mother ! '' 
said he . 
`` Well , and have you little ones ? '' 
he went on asking . 
Again Pierre 's negative answer seemed to distress him , and he hastened to add : `` Never mind ! 
You 're young folks yet , and please God may still have some . 
The great thing is to live in harmony ... '' `` But it 's all the same now , '' Pierre could not help saying . 
`` Ah , my dear fellow ! '' 
rejoined Karataev , `` never decline a prison or a beggar 's sack ! '' 
He seated himself more comfortably and coughed , evidently preparing to tell a long story . 
`` Well , my dear fellow , I was still living at home , '' he began . 
`` We had a well-to-do homestead , plenty of land , we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for . 
When Father and we went out mowing there were seven of us . 
We lived well . 
We were real peasants . 
It so happened ... '' And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone 's copse to take wood , how he had been caught by the keeper , had been tried , flogged , and sent to serve as a soldier . 
`` Well , lad , '' and a smile changed the tone of his voice `` we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing ! 
If it had not been for my sin , my brother would have had to go as a soldier . 
But he , my younger brother , had five little ones , while I , you see , only left a wife behind . 
We had a little girl , but God took her before I went as a soldier . 
I come home on leave and I 'll tell you how it was , I look and see that they are living better than before . 
The yard full of cattle , the women at home , two brothers away earning wages , and only Michael the youngest , at home . 
Father , he says , ` All my children are the same to me : it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten . 
But if Platon had n't been shaved for a soldier , Michael would have had to go . ' 
called us all to him and , will you believe it , placed us in front of the icons . 
` Michael , ' he says , ` come here and bow down to his feet ; and you , young woman , you bow down too ; and you , grandchildren , also bow down before him ! 
Do you understand ? ' 
he says . 
That 's how it is , dear fellow . 
Fate looks for a head . 
But we are always judging , ` that 's not well -- that 's not right ! ' 
Our luck is like water in a dragnet : you pull at it and it bulges , but when you 've drawn it out it 's empty ! 
That 's how it is . '' 
And Platon shifted his seat on the straw . 
After a short silence he rose . 
`` Well , I think you must be sleepy , '' said he , and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating : `` Lord Jesus Christ , holy Saint Nicholas , Frola and Lavra !
