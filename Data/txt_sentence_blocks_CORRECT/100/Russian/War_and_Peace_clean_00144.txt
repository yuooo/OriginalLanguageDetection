I have n't touched it for a long time . 
That 's it -- come on ! 
I 've given it up . '' 
Anisya Fedorovna , with her light step , willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar . 
Without looking at anyone , `` Uncle '' blew the dust off it and , tapping the case with his bony fingers , tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair . 
He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard , arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture , and , with a wink at Anisya Fedorovna , struck a single chord , pure and sonorous , and then quietly , smoothly , and confidently began playing in very slow time , not My Lady , but the well-known song : Came a maiden down the street . 
The tune , played with precision and in exact time , began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha , arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna 's whole being . 
Anisya Fedorovna flushed , and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room . 
`` Uncle '' continued to play correctly , carefully , with energetic firmness , looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna had just stood . 
Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches , especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when , here and there , as he ran his fingers over the strings , something seemed to snap . 
`` Lovely , lovely ! 
Go on , Uncle , go on ! '' 
shouted Natasha as soon as he had finished . 
She jumped up and hugged and kissed him . 
`` Nicholas , Nicholas ! '' 
she said , turning to her brother , as if asking him : `` What is it moves me so ? '' 
Nicholas too was greatly pleased by `` Uncle 's '' playing , and `` Uncle '' played the piece over again . 
Anisya Fedorovna 's smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces ... Fetching water clear and sweet , Stop , dear maiden , I entreat - played `` Uncle '' once more , running his fingers skillfully over the strings , and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders . 
`` Go on , Uncle dear , '' Natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended on it . 
`` Uncle '' rose , and it was as if there were two men in him : one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow , while the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance . 
`` Now then , niece ! '' 
he exclaimed , waving to Natasha the hand that had just struck a chord . 
Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders , ran forward to face `` Uncle , '' and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude . 
Where , how , and when had this young countess , educated by an emigree French governess , imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale * would , one would have supposed , long ago have effaced ? 
But the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that `` Uncle '' had expected of her . 
As soon as she had struck her pose , and smiled triumphantly , proudly , and with sly merriment , the fear that had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end , and they were already admiring her . 
* The French shawl dance . 
She did the right thing with such precision , such complete precision , that Anisya Fedorovna , who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance , had tears in her eyes , though she laughed as she watched this slim , graceful countess , reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself , who yet was able to understand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya 's father and mother and aunt , and in every Russian man and woman . 
`` Well , little countess ; that 's it -- come on ! '' 
cried `` Uncle , '' with a joyous laugh , having finished the dance . 
`` Well done , niece ! 
Now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you . 
That 's it -- come on ! '' 
`` He 's chosen already , '' said Nicholas smiling . 
`` Oh ? '' 
said `` Uncle '' in surprise , looking inquiringly at Natasha , who nodded her head with a happy smile . 
`` And such a one ! '' 
she said . 
But as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her . 
`` What did Nicholas ' smile mean when he said ` chosen already ' ? 
Is he glad of it or not ? 
It is as if he thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety . 
But he would understand it all . 
Where is he now ? '' 
she thought , and her face suddenly became serious . 
But this lasted only a second . 
`` Do n't dare to think about it , '' she said to herself , and sat down again smilingly beside `` Uncle , '' begging him to play something more . 
`` Uncle '' played another song and a valse ; then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song : As 't was growing dark last night Fell the snow so soft and light ... `` Uncle '' sang as peasants sing , with full and naive conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself , and that apart from the words there is no tune , which exists only to give measure to the words . 
As a result of this the unconsidered tune , like the song of a bird , was extraordinarily good . 
Natasha was in ecstasies over `` Uncle 's '' singing . 
She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar . 
She asked `` Uncle '' for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song . 
After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men , who had been sent to look for them , arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya . 
The count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious , said one of the men . 
Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps . 
Natasha and Nicholas got into the other . 
`` Uncle '' wrapped Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness . 
He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed , so that they had to go round by the ford , and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns . 
`` Good-by , dear niece , '' his voice called out of the darkness -- not the voice Natasha had known previously , but the one that had sung As 't was growing dark last night . 
In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke . 
`` What a darling Uncle is ! '' 
said Natasha , when they had come out onto the highroad . 
`` Yes , '' returned Nicholas . 
`` You 're not cold ? '' 
`` No . 
I 'm quite , quite all right . 
I feel so comfortable ! '' 
answered Natasha , almost perplexed by her feelings . 
They remained silent a long while . 
The night was dark and damp . 
They could not see the horses , but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud . 
What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life ? 
How did they all find place in her ? 
But she was very happy . 
As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As 't was growing dark last night -- the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught . 
`` Got it ? '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` What were you thinking about just now , Nicholas ? '' 
inquired Natasha . 
They were fond of asking one another that question . 
`` I ? '' 
said Nicholas , trying to remember . 
`` Well , you see , first I thought that Rugay , the red hound , was like Uncle , and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him , if not for his riding , then for his manner . 
What a good fellow Uncle is ! 
Do n't you think so ? 
... Well , and you ? '' 
`` I ? 
Wait a bit , wait ... . 
Yes , first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home , but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness , and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe , but in Fairyland . 
And then I thought ... No , nothing else . '' 
`` I know , I expect you thought of him , '' said Nicholas , smiling as Natasha knew by the sound of his voice . 
`` No , '' said Natasha , though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest , and of how he would have liked `` Uncle . '' 
`` And then I was saying to myself all the way , ` How well Anisya carried herself , how well ! ' '' 
And Nicholas heard her spontaneous , happy , ringing laughter . 
`` And do you know , '' she suddenly said , `` I know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now . '' 
`` Rubbish , nonsense , humbug ! '' 
exclaimed Nicholas , and he thought : `` How charming this Natasha of mine is ! 
I have no other friend like her and never shall have . 
Why should she marry ? 
We might always drive about together ! ''
