`` To Poland , Panovie , I drink to your Poland ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I shall be delighted , panie , '' said the Pole on the sofa , with dignity and affable condescension , and he took his glass . 
`` And the other pan , what 's his name ? 
Drink , most illustrious , take your glass ! '' 
Mitya urged . 
`` Pan Vrublevsky , '' put in the Pole on the sofa . 
Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table , swaying as he walked . 
`` To Poland , Panovie ! '' 
cried Mitya , raisin , his glass .
