He had evidently not slept that night . 
He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun . 
He was entirely absorbed by two considerations : his wife 's guilt , of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt , and the guiltlessness of Dolokhov , who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him ... `` I should perhaps have done the same thing in his place , '' thought Pierre . 
`` It 's even certain that I should have done the same , then why this duel , this murder ? 
Either I shall kill him , or he will hit me in the head , or elbow , or knee . 
Ca n't I go away from here , run away , bury myself somewhere ? '' 
passed through his mind . 
But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him , he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way , which inspired the respect of the onlookers , `` Will it be long ? 
Are things ready ? '' 
When all was ready , the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers , and the pistols loaded , Nesvitski went up to Pierre .
