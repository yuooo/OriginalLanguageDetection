For I can not imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him , that for his sake she had rejected her first lover , that she was summoning him , Mitya , to a new life , that she was promising him happiness - and when ? 
When everything was over for him and nothing was possible ! 
`` By the way , I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the light it throws on the prisoner 's position at the moment . 
This woman , this love of his , had been till the last moment , till the very instant of his arrest , a being unattainable , passionately desired by him but unattainable . 
Yet why did he not shoot himself then , why did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was ? 
It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained him . 
Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress , who was at the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than ever - he did not leave her side , abasing himself in his homage before her . 
`` His passion might well , for a moment , stifle not only the fear of arrest , but even the torments of conscience . 
For a moment , oh , only for a moment ! 
I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by these influences - first , the influence of drink , of noise and excitement , of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song , and of her , flushed with wine , singing and dancing and laughing to him !
