Do n't make jokes ! '' 
cried Anatole , suddenly rolling his eyes . 
`` Why joke ? '' 
said the driver , laughing . 
`` As if I 'd grudge my gentlemen anything ! 
As fast as ever the horses can gallop , so fast we 'll go ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Well , sit down . '' 
`` Yes , sit down ! ''
