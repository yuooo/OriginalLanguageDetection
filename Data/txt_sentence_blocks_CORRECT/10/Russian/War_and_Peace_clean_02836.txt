How I love you ! '' 
`` All right , all right ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
But Petya did not let go of him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him . 
Dolokhov kissed him , laughed , turned his horse , and vanished into the darkness . 
Having returned to the watchman 's hut , Petya found Denisov in the passage . 
He was awaiting Petya 's return in a state of agitation , anxiety , and self-reproach for having let him go . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Yes , thank God ! ''
