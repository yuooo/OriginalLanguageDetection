wounded ... my darling boy ... the countess ... promoted to be an officer ... thank God ... How tell the little countess ! '' 
Anna Mikhaylovna sat down beside him , with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter , then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count , and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess , and after tea , with God 's help , would inform her . 
At dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about Nikolenka , twice asked when the last letter had been received from him , though she knew that already , and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day . 
Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikhaylovna , the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters . 
Natasha , who , of the whole family , was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation , look , and expression , pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikhaylovna , that it had something to do with her brother , and that Anna Mikhaylovna was preparing them for it . 
Bold as she was , Natasha , who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka , did not venture to ask any questions at dinner , but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess ' remarks . 
After dinner , she rushed head long after Anna Mikhaylovna and , dashing at her , flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room . 
`` Auntie , darling , do tell me what it is ! '' 
`` Nothing , my dear . ''
