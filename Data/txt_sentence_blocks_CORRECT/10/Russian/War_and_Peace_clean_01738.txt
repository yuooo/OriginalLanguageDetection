He entered briskly , with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back . 
His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders , and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding , had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort . 
It was evident , too , that he was in the best of spirits that day . 
He nodded in answer to Balashav 's low and respectful bow , and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well . 
`` Good day , General ! '' 
said he . 
`` I have received the letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you . '' 
He glanced with his large eyes into Balashav 's face and immediately looked past him . 
It was plain that Balashev 's personality did not interest him at all . 
Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him .
