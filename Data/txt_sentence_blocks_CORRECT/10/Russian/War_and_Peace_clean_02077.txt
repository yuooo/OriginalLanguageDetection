Next day toward evening the princess set off , and Pierre 's head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates . 
In general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him . 
Pierre listened to him , scarcely able to repress a smile . 
`` Well then , sell it , '' said he . 
`` What 's to be done ? 
I ca n't draw back now ! '' 
The worse everything became , especially his own affairs , the better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching . 
Hardly anyone he knew was left in town . 
Julie had gone , and so had Princess Mary . 
Of his intimate friends only the Rostovs remained , but he did not go to see them .
