Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night . 
He often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime , but at night , lying on his bed without undressing , he generally remained awake thinking . 
So he lay now on his bed , supporting his large , heavy , scarred head on his plump hand , with his one eye open , meditating and peering into the darkness . 
Since Bennigsen , who corresponded with the Emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff , had begun to avoid him , Kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements .

Patience and time are my warriors , my champions , '' thought Kutuzov .
