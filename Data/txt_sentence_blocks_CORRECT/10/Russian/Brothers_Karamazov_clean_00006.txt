man , and distinguished among the Miusovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture , who had been in the capitals and abroad .

In the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch , both in Russia and abroad . 
He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally , and in his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the Paris Revolution of February , 1848 , hinting that he himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades .
