He not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning , but , on the contrary , tried to reassure Balashev . 
It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake , and that in his perception whatever he did was right , not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong , but because he did it . 
The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna , where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him . 
From all the windows of the streets through which he rode , rugs , flags , and his monogram were displayed , and the Polish ladies , welcoming him , waved their handkerchiefs to him . 
At dinner , having placed Balashev beside him , Napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own courtiers , one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success . 
In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian capital , not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit , but as if convinced that Balashev , as a Russian , must be flattered by his curiosity . 
`` How many inhabitants are there in Moscow ? 
How many houses ? 
Is it true that Moscow is called ` Holy Moscow ' ? 
How many churches are there in Moscow ? ''
