I 'm merry ; you be merry , too ... . 
I love somebody here . 
Guess who it is . 
Ah , look , my boy has fallen asleep , poor dear , he 's drunk . '' 
She meant Kalganov . 
He was , in fact , drunk , and had dropped asleep for a moment , sitting on the sofa . 
But he was not merely drowsy from drink ; he felt suddenly dejected , or , as he said , `` bored . '' 
He was intensely depressed by the girls ' songs , which , as the drinking went on , gradually became coarse and more reckless . 
And the dances were as bad . 
Two girls dressed up as bears , and a lively girl , called Stepanida , with a stick in her hand , acted the part of keeper , and began to `` show them . ''
