He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him . 
`` Good-by , be off ! '' 
he shouted . 
`` Whether we meet again or not ... '' and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed . 
It was already dark , and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andrew 's face was angry or tender . 
For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away . 
`` No , he does not want it ! '' 
Pierre concluded . 
`` And I know that this is our last meeting ! '' 
He sighed deeply and rode back to Gorki .
