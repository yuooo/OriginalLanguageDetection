But wherever it may be , many a man will be missing tomorrow ! '' 
he remarked . 
An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking , but at this point , evidently not liking the officer 's remark , interrupted him . 
`` Gabions must be sent for , '' said he sternly . 
The officer appeared abashed , as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak to speak of it . 
`` Well , send number three company again , '' the officer replied hurriedly . 
`` And you , are you one of the doctors ? '' 
`` No , I 've come on my own , '' answered Pierre , and he went down the hill again , passing the militiamen . 
`` Oh , those damned fellows ! '' 
muttered the officer who followed him , holding his nose as he ran past the men at work .
