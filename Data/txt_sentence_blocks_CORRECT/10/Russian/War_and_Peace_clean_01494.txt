They talked of how they would live when they were married , how their husbands would be friends , and how happy they would be . 
On Natasha 's table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared beforehand . 
`` Only when will all that be ? 
I am afraid never ... . 
It would be too good ! '' 
said Natasha , rising and going to the looking glasses . 
`` Sit down , Natasha ; perhaps you 'll see him , '' said Sonya . 
Natasha lit the candles , one on each side of one of the looking glasses , and sat down . 
`` I see someone with a mustache , '' said Natasha , seeing her own face . 
`` You must n't laugh , Miss , '' said Dunyasha .
