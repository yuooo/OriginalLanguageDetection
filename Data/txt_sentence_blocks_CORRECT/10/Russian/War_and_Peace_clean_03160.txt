Lanfrey , a Republican , says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people . 
So the historians of this class , by mutually destroying one another 's positions , destroy the understanding of the force which produces events , and furnish no reply to history 's essential question . 
Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians ' view of the force which produces events . 
They do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers , but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces . 
In describing a war or the subjugation of a people , a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man , but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event . 
According to this view the power of historical personages , represented as the product of many forces , can no longer , it would seem , be regarded as a force that itself produces events . 
Yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events , and treat it as their cause . 
In their exposition , an historic character is first the product of his time , and his power only the resultant of various forces , and then his power is itself a force producing events . 
Gervinus , Schlosser , and others , for instance , at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution , of the ideas of 1789 and so forth , and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon 's misdirected will , and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon 's caprice . 
The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age produced Napoleon 's power .
