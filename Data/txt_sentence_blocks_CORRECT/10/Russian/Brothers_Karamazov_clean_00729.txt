`` No , brother , we had better not drink , '' said Alyosha suddenly . 
`` Besides I feel somehow depressed . '' 
`` Yes , you 've been depressed a long time , I 've noticed it . '' 
`` Have you settled to go to-morrow morning , then ? '' 
`` Morning ? 
I did n't say I should go in the morning ... . 
But perhaps it may be the morning .

I should have left long ago , so far as he is concerned .
