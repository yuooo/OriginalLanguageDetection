Good lord , they 've even grabbed those chaises ! 
... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks ... . 
Heavens ! 
They 're fighting . '' 
`` That 's right , hit him on the snout -- on his snout ! 
Like this , we sha n't get away before evening . 
Look , look there ... . 
Why , that must be Napoleon 's own . 
See what horses ! 
And the monograms with a crown !
