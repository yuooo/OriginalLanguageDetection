Princess Mary turned to Sonya and , trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl , she kissed her . 
But she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
she asked again , addressing them all . 
`` He is downstairs . 
Natasha is with him , '' answered Sonya , flushing . 
`` We have sent to ask . 
I think you must be tired , Princess . '' 
Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary 's eyes . 
She turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him , when light , impetuous , and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door .
