`` You should have told us of that first , that explains everything , we ca n't judge a monk . '' 
They laughed and could not stop themselves , and not scornfully , but kindly and merrily . 
They all felt friendly to me at once , even those who had been sternest in their censure , and all the following month , before my discharge came , they could not make enough of me . 
`` Ah , you monk , '' they would say . 
And everyone said something kind to me , they began trying to dissuade me , even to pity me : `` What are you doing to yourself ? '' 
`` No , '' they would say , `` he is a brave fellow , he faced fire and could have fired his own pistol too , but he had a dream the night before that he should become a monk , that 's why he did it . '' 
It was the same thing with the society of the town . 
Till then I had been kindly received , but had not been the object of special attention , and now all came to know me at once and invited me ; they laughed at me , but they loved me . 
I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel , the authorities took no notice of it , because my antagonist was a near relation of our general , and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences , and as I resigned my commission , they took it as a joke . 
And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly , regardless of their laughter , for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter .
