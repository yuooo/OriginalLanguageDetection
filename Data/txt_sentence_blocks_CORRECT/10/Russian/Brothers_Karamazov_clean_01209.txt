`` Confound it ! 
An old woman , an old man ... . 
Have you killed someone ? ''

We had a row - and made it up . 
In a place I know of . 
We parted friends . 
A fool ... . 
He 's forgiven me ... . 
He 's sure to have forgiven me by now ... if he had got up , he would n't have forgiven me '' - Mitya suddenly winked - `` only damn him , you know , I say , Pyotr Ilyitch , damn him !
