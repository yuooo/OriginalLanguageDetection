`` If you do not understand these sentiments , '' he seemed to be saying , `` so much the worse for you ! '' 
Behind him stood the aide-de-camp , the doctors , and the menservants ; the men and women had separated as in church . 
All were silently crossing themselves , and the reading of the church service , the subdued chanting of deep bass voices , and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about , went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper . 
He lit it and , distracted by observing those around him , began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper . 
Sophie , the rosy , laughter-loving , youngest princess with the mole , watched him . 
She smiled , hid her face in her handkerchief , and remained with it hidden for awhile ; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh . 
She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing , but could not resist looking at him : so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns . 
In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased , they whispered to one another , and the old servant who was holding the count 's hand got up and said something to the ladies . 
Anna Mikhaylovna stepped forward and , stooping over the dying man , beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back .
