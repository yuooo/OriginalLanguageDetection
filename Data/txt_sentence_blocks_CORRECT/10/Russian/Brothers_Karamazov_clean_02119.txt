But you are a little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch , and what do you want with virtue ? 
Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to anyone ? 
Because you do n't know yourself why you go ! 
Oh , you 'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go ! 
And can you have made up your mind ? 
You 've not made up your mind . 
You 'll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not . 
But you will go ; you know you 'll go . 
You know that whichever way you decide , the decision does not depend on you . 
You 'll go because you wo n't dare not to go .
