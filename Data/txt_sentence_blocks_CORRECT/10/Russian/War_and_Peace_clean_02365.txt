Almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew 's caleche . 
She did not know who was in it , but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche .

In Kudrino , from the Nikitski , Presnya , and Podnovinsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs ' , and as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast . 
As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha , who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past , suddenly cried out in joyful surprise : `` Dear me ! 
Mamma , Sonya , look , it 's he ! '' 
`` Who ?

`` Look ! 
Yes , on my word , it 's Bezukhov ! ''
