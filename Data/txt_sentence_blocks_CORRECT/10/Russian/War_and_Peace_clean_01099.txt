Je suis tres contente de vous voir , '' * she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand . 
She had known him as a child , and now his friendship with Andrew , his misfortune with his wife , and above all his kindly , simple face disposed her favorably toward him . 
She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say , `` I like you very much , but please do n't laugh at my people . '' 
After exchanging the first greetings , they sat down . 
* `` Delighted to see you . 
I am very glad to see you . '' 
`` Ah , and Ivanushka is here too ! '' 
said Prince Andrew , glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim . 
`` Andrew ! '' 
said Princess Mary , imploringly .
