answered Kolya , with perfect simplicity . 
`` I wanted to show him in all his glory . '' 
`` Perezvon ! 
Perezvon , '' called Ilusha suddenly , snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog . 
`` What is it ? 
Let him jump up on the bed ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha . 
The boy threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek . 
Ilusha crept close to him , stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog 's shaggy coat .
