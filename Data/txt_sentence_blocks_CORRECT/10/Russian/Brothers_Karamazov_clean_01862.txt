These exceptions , however , were few in number ; only Grushenka , Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this . 
But the captain of the police , Mihail Mihailovitch , was very favourably disposed to Grushenka . 
His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man 's conscience , and when he learned the whole story , he completely changed his view of her . 
And strange to say , though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt , yet after Mitya was once in prison , the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him . 
`` He was a man of good heart , perhaps , '' he thought , `` who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation . '' 
His first horror had been succeeded by pity . 
As for Alyosha , the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for a long time . 
Rakitin , who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner , was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the `` police captain 's young ladies , '' as he called them , and was always hanging about their house . 
He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent , too , who , though scrupulous in the performance of his duties , was a kindhearted old man . 
Alyosha , again , had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent , who was fond of talking to him , generally on sacred subjects .
