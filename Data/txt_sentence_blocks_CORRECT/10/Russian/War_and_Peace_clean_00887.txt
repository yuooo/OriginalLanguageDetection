`` Sideways ! 
Cover yourself with your pistol ! '' 
ejaculated Nesvitski . 
`` Cover yourself ! '' 
even Denisov cried to his adversary . 
Pierre , with a gentle smile of pity and remorse , his arms and legs helplessly spread out , stood with his broad chest directly facing Dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him . 
Denisov , Rostov , and Nesvitski closed their eyes . 
At the same instant they heard a report and Dolokhov 's angry cry . 
`` Missed ! '' 
shouted Dolokhov , and he lay helplessly , face downwards on the snow .
