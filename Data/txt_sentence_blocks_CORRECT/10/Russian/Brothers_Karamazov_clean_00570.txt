`` One reptile will devour the other , '' Ivan had pronounced the day before , speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri . 
So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as a reptile , and perhaps long done so . 
Was it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna ? 
That phrase had , of course , escaped Ivan unawares yesterday , but that only made it more important . 
If he felt like that , what chance was there of peace ? 
Were there not , on the contrary , new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family ? 
And with which of them was Alyosha to sympathise ? 
And what was he to wish for each of them ? 
He loved them both , but what could he desire for each in the midst of these conflicting interests ? 
He might go quite astray in this maze , and Alyosha 's heart could not endure uncertainty , because his love was always of an active character .
