There was a sort of boldness , a sudden confidence shining in his eyes . 
His face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before . 
He led the Poles , not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid , but into the bedroom on the right , where the trunks and packages were kept , and there were two large beds , with pyramids of cotton pillows on each . 
There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner . 
The small man and Mitya sat down to this table , facing each other , while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them , his hands behind his back . 
The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive . 
`` What can I do for you , panie ? '' 
lisped the little Pole . 
`` Well , look here , panie , I wo n't keep you long . 
There 's money for you , '' he pulled out his notes .
