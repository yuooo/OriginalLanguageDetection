It was thought of long ago . 
It is done in all the brothels , '' and with these words Marya Dmitrievna , turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round , moved across the room . 
Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded in Petersburg as a buffoon , and so of what she had said they only noticed , and repeated in a whisper , the one coarse word she had used , supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word . 
Prince Vasili , who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times , remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her : `` Helene , I have a word to say to you , '' and he would lead her aside , drawing her hand downward . 
`` I have heard of certain projects concerning ... you know . 
Well my dear child , you know how your father 's heart rejoices to know that you ... You have suffered so much ... . 
But , my dear child , consult only your own heart . 
That is all I have to say , '' and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter 's and move away . 
Bilibin , who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man , and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as Helene always has -- men friends who can never change into lovers -- once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering .
