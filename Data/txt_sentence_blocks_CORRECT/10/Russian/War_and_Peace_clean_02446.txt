These words went from one to another in the crowd . 
The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the Kremlin . 
The porter , listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian , did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others . 
Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian army was . 
One of the Russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter . 
A French officer , returning from the advanced detachment , rode up to Murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there . 
`` Good ! '' 
said Murat and , turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite , ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates . 
The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up the Arbat . 
When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka Street they halted and drew in the Square .
