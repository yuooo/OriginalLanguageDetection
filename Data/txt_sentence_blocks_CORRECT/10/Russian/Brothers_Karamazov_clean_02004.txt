`` I 've no answer to give you , '' said Smerdyakov , looking down again . 
`` You may be sure I 'll make you answer ! '' 
`` Why are you so uneasy ? '' 
Smerdyakov stared at him , not simply with contempt , but almost with repulsion . 
`` Is this because the trial begins to-morrow ? 
Nothing will happen to you ; ca n't you believe that at last ? 
Go home , go to bed and sleep in peace , do n't be afraid of anything . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ... . 
What have I to be afraid of to-morrow ? '' 
Ivan articulated in astonishment , and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul .
