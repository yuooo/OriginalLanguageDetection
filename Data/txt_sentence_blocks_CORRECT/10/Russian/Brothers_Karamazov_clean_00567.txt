A Laceration in the Drawing-Room BUT in the drawing-room the conversation was already over . 
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited , though she looked resolute . 
At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered , Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave . 
His face was rather pale , and Alyosha looked at him anxiously . 
For this moment was to solve a doubt , a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha . 
During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna , and , what was more , that he meant `` to carry her off from Dmitri . 
Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous , though it worried him extremely . 
He loved both his brothers , and dreaded such rivalry between them . 
Meantime , Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival , and that it was a great assistance to him , Dmitri . 
In what way did it assist him ?
