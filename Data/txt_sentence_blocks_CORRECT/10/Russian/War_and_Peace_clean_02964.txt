Previously he had talked a great deal , grew excited when he talked , and seldom listened ; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets . 
The princess , who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old count 's death , now after staying a short time in Orel - where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him -- felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him . 
Pierre did not in any way seek her approval , he merely studied her with interest . 
Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony , and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature ; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart , and , mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully , she let him see the hidden , kindly sides of her character . 
The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully , evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them . 
Yet Pierre 's cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered , hard , and -LRB- in her own way -RRB- proud princess . 
`` Yes , he is a very , very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself , '' thought she . 
His servants too -- Terenty and Vaska -- in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in Pierre . 
They considered that he had become much `` simpler . '' 
Terenty , when he had helped him undress and wished him good night , often lingered with his master 's boots in his hands and clothes over his arm , to see whether he would not start a talk .
