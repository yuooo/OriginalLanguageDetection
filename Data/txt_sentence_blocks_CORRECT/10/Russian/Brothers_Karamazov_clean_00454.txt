He felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time . 
`` You wo n't make me blush , dear young lady , kissing my hand like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Do you think I meant to make you blush ? ''

`` Ah my dear , how little you understand me ! 
`` Yes , and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me , dear young lady . 
Maybe I 'm not so good as I seem to you . 
I 've a bad heart ; I will have my own way . 
I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun . ''
