`` What ? '' 
asked the commander . 
At that moment , on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted , two men appeared on horse back . 
They were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack . 
The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before , namely , that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march : in their greatcoats , and packs , and without any preparation whatever . 
A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack , and Kutuzov , not considering this junction advisable , meant , among other arguments in support of his view , to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia . 
With this object he intended to meet the regiment ; so the worse the condition it was in , the better pleased the commander in chief would be . 
Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances , he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order , and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied . 
On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head , silently shrugged his shoulders , and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture . 
`` A fine mess we 've made of it ! ''
