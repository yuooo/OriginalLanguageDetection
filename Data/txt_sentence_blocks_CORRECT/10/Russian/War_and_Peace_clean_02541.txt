Breathless with joy , Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms . 
But seeing a stranger the sickly , scrofulous-looking child , unattractively like her mother , began to yell and run away . 
Pierre , however , seized her and lifted her in his arms . 
She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre 's hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth . 
Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal . 
But he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house . 
It was now , however , impossible to get back the way he had come ; the maid , Aniska , was no longer there , and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet , painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out . 
Having run through different yards and side streets , Pierre got back with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the corner of the Povarskoy . 
He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child , so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses . 
Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings , there were several French soldiers in a variety of clothing .
