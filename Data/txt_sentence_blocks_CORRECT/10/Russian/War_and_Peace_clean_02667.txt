Prince Andrew 's little son was seven . 
He could scarcely read , and knew nothing . 
After that day he lived through many things , gaining knowledge , observation , and experience , but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired , he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father , Mary , and Natasha , than he had then . 
He understood it completely , and , leaving the room without crying , went silently up to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful , thoughtful eyes , then his uplifted , rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry . 
After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary , or to Natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt , and clung to them quietly and shyly . 
When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what Natasha 's face had told her . 
She did not speak any more to Natasha of hopes of saving his life . 
She took turns with her beside his sofa , and did not cry any more , but prayed continually , turning in soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable , whose presence above the dying man was now so evident . 
Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die , but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead . 
He was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence .
