What , you are turning up your nose again ? 
Angry again ? 
I do n't know how to please you - '' * Ah , my father , this gives him so much pleasure , and me so little pain ! 
`` Leave me alone , you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare , '' Ivan moaned miserably , helpless before his apparition . 
`` I am bored with you , agonisingly and insufferably . 
I would give anything to be able to shake you off ! '' 
`` I repeat , moderate your expectations , do n't demand of me ` everything great and noble , ' and you 'll see how well we shall get on , '' said the gentleman impressively . 
`` You are really angry with me for not having appeared to you in a red glow , with thunder and lightning , with scorched wings , but have shown myself in such a modest form . 
You are wounded , in the first place , in your asthetic feelings , and , secondly , in your pride . 
How could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you !
