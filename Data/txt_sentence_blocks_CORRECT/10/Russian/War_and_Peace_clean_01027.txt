But these doubts only lasted a moment . 
Pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around , remembered all he had already gone through , and realized that he could not stop halfway . 
He was aghast at his hesitation and , trying to arouse his former devotional feeling , prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple . 
And really , the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before . 
When he had lain there some time , he was told to get up , and a white leather apron , such as the others wore , was put on him : he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves , and then the Grand Master addressed him . 
He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron , which symbolized strength and purity ; then of the unexplained trowel , he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice , and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor . 
As to the first pair of gloves , a man 's , he said that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them . 
The second pair of man 's gloves he was to wear at the meetings , and finally of the third , a pair of women 's gloves , he said : `` Dear brother , these woman 's gloves are intended for you too .
