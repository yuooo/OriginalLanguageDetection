he whispered to himself , and , strange to say , almost all his gladness and selfsatisfaction passed in one instant . 
As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his heart , like a recollection or , more exactly , a reminder , of something agonising and revolting that was in that room now , at that moment , and had been there before . 
He sank wearily on his sofa . 
The old woman brought him a samovar ; he made tea , but did not touch it . 
He sat on the sofa and felt giddy . 
He felt that he was ill and helpless . 
He was beginning to drop asleep , but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness . 
At moments he fancied he was delirious , but it was not illness that he thought of most . 
Sitting down again , he began looking round , as though searching for something . 
This happened several times .
