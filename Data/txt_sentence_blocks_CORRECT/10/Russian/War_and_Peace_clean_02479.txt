`` Paris ? 
... But Paris , Paris ... '' `` Paris -- the capital of the world , '' Pierre finished his remark for him . 
The captain looked at Pierre . 
He had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing , kindly eyes . 
`` Well , if you had n't told me you were Russian , I should have wagered that you were Parisian ! 
You have that ... I do n't know what , that ... '' and having uttered this compliment , he again gazed at him in silence . 
`` I have been in Paris . 
I spent years there , '' said Pierre . 
`` Oh yes , one sees that plainly . 
Paris !
