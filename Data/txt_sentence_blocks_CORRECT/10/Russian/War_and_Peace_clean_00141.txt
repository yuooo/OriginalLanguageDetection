The princess gave no reply and did not even smile , but left the room as Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and , occupying the position she had conquered , settled down in an armchair , inviting Prince Vasili to take a seat beside her . 
`` Boris , '' she said to her son with a smile , `` I shall go in to see the count , my uncle ; but you , my dear , had better go to Pierre meanwhile and do n't forget to give him the Rostovs ' invitation . 
They ask him to dinner . 
I suppose he wo n't go ? '' 
she continued , turning to the prince . 
`` On the contrary , '' replied the prince , who had plainly become depressed , `` I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man ... . 
Here he is , and the count has not once asked for him . '' 
He shrugged his shoulders . 
A footman conducted Boris down one flight of stairs and up another , to Pierre 's rooms . 
Pierre , after all , had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg , and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow .
