Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively . 
`` If you would kindly listen , madam , for half a moment , I 'll explain it all in a couple of words , '' answered Perhotin , firmly . 
`` At five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me , and I know for a fact he had no money . 
Yet at nine o'clock , he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand , about two or three thousand roubles . 
His hands and face were all covered with blood , and he looked like a madman . 
When I asked him where he had got so much money , he answered that he had just received it from you , that you had given him a sum of three thousand to go to the gold mines ... '' Madame Hohlakov 's face assumed an expression of intense and painful excitement . 
`` Good God ! 
He must have killed his old father ! '' 
she cried , clasping her hands . 
`` I have never given him money , never !
