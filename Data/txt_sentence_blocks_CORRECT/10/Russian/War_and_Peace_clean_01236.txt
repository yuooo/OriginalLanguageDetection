But he looked at me with vexation and jumped up , breaking off his remarks . 
I felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me ; but he did not reply , gave me a kind look , and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed . 
He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down too . 
And he said , `` Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation ? 
Do you know it ? 
I think you know it already . '' 
Abashed by this question , I replied that sloth was my chief temptation . 
He shook his head incredulously ; and even more abashed , I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised , I was not living with her as her husband . 
To this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one 's embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty . 
But I replied that I should be ashamed to do it , and suddenly everything vanished .
