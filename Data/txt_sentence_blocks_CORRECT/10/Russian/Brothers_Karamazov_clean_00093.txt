They had been staying a week in our town , where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion , but had visited Father Zossima once already , three days before . 
Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw anyone , they had now suddenly turned up again , and urgently entreated `` the happiness of looking once again on the great healer . '' 
The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter 's invalid carriage , and two paces from her stood an old monk , not one of our monastery , but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north . 
He too sought the elder 's blessing . 
But Father Zossima , on entering the portico , went first straight to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into the portico . 
Father Zossima stood on the top step , put on his stole , and began blessing the women who thronged about him . 
One crazy woman was led up to him . 
As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth . 
Laying the stole on her forehead , he read a short prayer over her , and she was at once soothed and quieted . 
I do not know how it may be now , but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these `` possessed '' women in the villages and monasteries .
