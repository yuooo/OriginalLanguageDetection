What is to be done in these circumstances ? 
To favor revolutions , overthrow everything , repel force by force ? 
... No ! 
We are very far from that . 
Every violent reform deserves censure , for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are , and also because wisdom needs no violence . 
`` The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction -- aiming at the punishment of vice and folly , and patronizing talent and virtue : raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood . 
Only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it . 
In a word , we must found a form of government holding universal sway , which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship , and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order , which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice . 
This aim was that of Christianity itself . 
It taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men .
