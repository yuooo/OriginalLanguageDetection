`` Is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me ? '' 
she asked herself , and immediately answered , `` Yes , everything ! 
He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world . '' 
Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes . 
`` I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you . 
May I hope ? '' 
He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face . 
Her face said : `` Why ask ? 
Why doubt what you can not but know ? 
Why speak , when words can not express what one feels ? ''
