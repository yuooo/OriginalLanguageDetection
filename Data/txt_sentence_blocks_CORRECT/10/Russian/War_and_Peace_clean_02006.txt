I dare say ! 
` I 'll give you grain , indeed ! ' 
she says , '' voices in the crowd were heard saying . 
With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the house . 
Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning , she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts . 
For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants ' voices that reached her from the village , but it was not of them she was thinking . 
She felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them . 
She thought only of one thing , her sorrow , which , after the break caused by cares for the present , seemed already to belong to the past . 
Now she could remember it and weep or pray .
