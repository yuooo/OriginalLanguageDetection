We must live , we must love , and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth , but have lived and shall live forever , there , in the Whole , '' said Pierre , and he pointed to the sky . 
Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre , and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters . 
There was perfect stillness . 
Pierre became silent . 
The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below . 
Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre 's words , whispering : `` It is true , believe it . '' 
He sighed , and glanced with a radiant , childlike , tender look at Pierre 's face , flushed and rapturous , but yet shy before his superior friend . 
`` Yes , if it only were so ! '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` However , it is time to get on , '' he added , and , stepping off the raft , he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed , and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high , everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield ; and something that had long been slumbering , something that was best within him , suddenly awoke , joyful and youthful , in his soul .
