Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie . 
He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened , but imperceptibly , involuntarily , and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood . 
If he had told the truth to his hearers -- who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story -- they would either not have believed him or , still worse , would have thought that Rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him . 
He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood . 
Besides , to tell everything as it really happened , it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened . 
It is very difficult to tell the truth , and young people are rarely capable of it . 
His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement , he had flown like a storm at the square , cut his way in , slashed right and left , how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted , and so on . 
And so he told them all that . 
In the middle of his story , just as he was saying : `` You can not imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack , '' Prince Andrew , whom Boris was expecting , entered the room . 
Prince Andrew , who liked to help young men , was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris , who had managed to please him the day before , he wished to do what the young man wanted .
