It was repeated all over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that was perhaps not quite complete - that is , in the statement that the officer had let the young lady depart `` with nothing but a respectful bow . ''

She must have understood it , yet she made up her mind to tell everything . 
Of course , all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by it . 
As for the judges and the lawyers , they listened in reverent , almost shamefaced silence to Katerina Ivanovna . 
The prosecutor did not venture upon even one question on the subject . 
Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her .
