Natasha sat down , listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air , and then got up again . 
`` The island of Madagascar , '' she said , `` Ma-da-gas-car , '' she repeated , articulating each syllable distinctly , and , not replying to Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying , she went out of the room . 
Her brother Petya was upstairs too ; with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night . 
`` Petya ! 
Petya ! '' 
she called to him . 
`` Carry me downstairs . '' 
Petya ran up and offered her his back . 
She jumped on it , putting her arms round his neck , and he pranced along with her . 
`` No , do n't ... the island of Madagascar ! ''
