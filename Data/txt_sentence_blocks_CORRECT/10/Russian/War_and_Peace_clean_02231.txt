Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces , whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot . 
Disregarding the officers ' orders , the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently , as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them . 
From the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans . 
Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water , or to point out those who were to be brought in next . 
The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned , sighed , wept , screamed , swore , or asked for vodka . 
Some were delirious . 
Prince Andrew 's bearers , stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged , took him , as a regimental commander , close up to one of the tents and there stopped , awaiting instructions . 
Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him . 
He remembered the meadow , the wormwood , the field , the whirling black ball , and his sudden rush of passionate love of life . 
Two steps from him , leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention , stood a tall , handsome , black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head .
