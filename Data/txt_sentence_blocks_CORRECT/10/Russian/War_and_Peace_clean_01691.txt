I know I ca n't prevent your doing so , but if you have a spark of conscience ... '' Pierre paced the room several times in silence . 
Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips . 
`` After all , you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other people 's happiness and peace , and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself ! 
Amuse yourself with women like my wife -- with them you are within your rights , for they know what you want of them . 
They are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery ; but to promise a maid to marry her ... to deceive , to kidnap ... . 
Do n't you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child ? 
... '' Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look . 
`` I do n't know about that , eh ? '' 
said Anatole , growing more confident as Pierre mastered his wrath . 
`` I do n't know that and do n't want to , '' he said , not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw , `` but you have used such words to me -- ` mean ' and so on -- which as a man of honor I ca n't allow anyone to use . ''
