I was in Moscow ... . 
When have I said so ? '' 
Ivan faltered helplessly . 
`` You 've said so to yourself many times , when you 've been alone during these two dreadful months , '' Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before . 
Yet he was speaking now , as it were , not of himself , not of his own will , but obeying some irresistible command . 
`` You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else . 
But you did n't do it : you are mistaken : you are not the murderer . 
Do you hear ? 
It was not you ! 
God has sent me to tell you so . ''
