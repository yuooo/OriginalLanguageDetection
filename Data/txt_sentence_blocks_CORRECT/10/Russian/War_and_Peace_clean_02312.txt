Oh , by the by ! '' 
he shouted through the doorway after Pierre , `` is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus ? '' 
Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin 's room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself . 
When he reached home it was already getting dark . 
Some eight people had come to see him that evening : the secretary of a committee , the colonel of his battalion , his steward , his major-domo , and various petitioners . 
They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him . 
Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people . 
When left alone at last he opened and read his wife 's letter . 
`` They , the soldiers at the battery , Prince Andrew killed ... that old man ... Simplicity is submission to God . 
Suffering is necessary ... the meaning of all ... one must harness ... my wife is getting married ... One must forget and understand ... '' And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep .
