Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given Bolkonski . 
Speranski smiled more markedly . 
`` The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend Monsieur Magnitski , '' he said , fully articulating every word and syllable , `` and if you like I can put you in touch with him . '' 
He paused at the full stop . 
`` I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable . '' 
A circle soon formed round Speranski , and the old man who had talked about his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question to him . 
Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of Speranski 's : this man , not long since an insignificant divinity student , who now , Bolkonski thought , held in his hands -- those plump white hands -- the fate of Russia . 
Prince Andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speranski answered the old man . 
He appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height . 
When the old man began to speak too loud , Speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign .
