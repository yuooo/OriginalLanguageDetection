All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief 's and with the exception of Prince Bagration , who declined to come , were all there at the appointed time . 
Weyrother , who was in full control of the proposed battle , by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutuzov , who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war . 
Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable . 
He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart . 
Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know , but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to . 
Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy 's picket line to reconnoiter personally , and twice to the Emperors , Russian and Austrian , to report and explain , and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German , and now , much exhausted , he arrived at Kutuzov 's . 
He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief . 
He interrupted him , talked rapidly and indistinctly , without looking at the man he was addressing , and did not reply to questions put to him . 
He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful , weary , and distracted air , though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident . 
Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman 's castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz .
