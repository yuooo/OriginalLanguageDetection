Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch , ladies whom he had never seen before . 
On what terms she lived with them he did not know himself . 
It was very characteristic of him , indeed , that he never cared at whose expense he was living . 
In that respect he was a striking contrast to his elder brother Ivan , who struggled with poverty for his first two years in the university , maintained himself by his own efforts , and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor . 
But this strange trait in Alyosha 's character must not , I think , criticised too severely , for at the slightest acquaintance with him anyone would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths , almost of the type of religious enthusiast , who , if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune , would not hesitate to give it away for the asking , either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue . 
In general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money , not , of course , in a literal sense . 
When he was given pocket-money , which he never asked for , he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment , or he kept it for weeks together , not knowing what to do with it . 
In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov , a man very sensitive on the score of money and bourgeois honesty , pronounced the following judgment , after getting to know Alyosha : `` Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone without a penny , in the centre of an unknown town of a million inhabitants , and he would not come to harm , he would not die of cold and hunger , for he would be fed and sheltered at once ; and if he were not , he would find a shelter for himself , and it would cost him no effort or humiliation . 
And to shelter him would be no burden , but , on the contrary , would probably be looked on as a pleasure . '' 
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium .
