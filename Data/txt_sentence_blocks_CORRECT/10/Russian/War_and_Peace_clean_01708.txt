`` If I were not myself , but the handsomest , cleverest , and best man in the world , and were free , I would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love ! '' 
For the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness , and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room . 
Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom , restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him , and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh . 
`` Where to now , your excellency ? '' 
asked the coachman . 
`` Where to ? '' 
Pierre asked himself . 
`` Where can I go now ? 
Surely not to the Club or to pay calls ? '' 
All men seemed so pitiful , so poor , in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced : in comparison with that softened , grateful , last look she had given him through her tears .
