`` Kindly look at it , '' Smerdyakov answered , still in the same low tone . 
Ivan stepped up to the table , took up the roll of paper and began unfolding it , but suddenly drew back his fingers , as though from contact with a loathsome reptile . 
`` Your hands keep twitching , '' observed Smerdyakov , and he deliberately unfolded the bundle himself . 
Under the wrapper were three packets of hundred-rouble notes . 
`` They are all here , all the three thousand roubles ; you need not count them . 
Take them , '' Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan , nodding at the notes . 
Ivan sank back in his chair . 
He was as white as a handkerchief . 
`` You frightened me ... with your stocking , '' he said , with a strange grin . 
`` Can you really not have known till now ? ''
