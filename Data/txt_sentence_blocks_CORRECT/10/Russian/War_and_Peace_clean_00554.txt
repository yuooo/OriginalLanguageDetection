Captain Tushin , having given orders to his company , sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet , and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road . 
Rostov , too , dragged himself to the fire . 
From pain , cold , and damp , a feverish shivering shook his whole body . 
Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him , but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm , for which he could find no satisfactory position . 
He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire , which seemed to him dazzlingly red , and at the feeble , round-shouldered figure of Tushin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him . 
Tushin 's large , kind , intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostov , who saw that Tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not . 
From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry , who were walking , driving past , and settling down all around . 
The sound of voices , the tramping feet , the horses ' hoofs moving in mud , the crackling of wood fires near and afar , merged into one tremulous rumble . 
It was no longer , as before , a dark , unseen river flowing through the gloom , but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm . 
Rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him .
