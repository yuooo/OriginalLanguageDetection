To the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself , namely , that the course of human events is predetermined from on high -- depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events , and that a Napoleon 's influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious . 
Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX 's will , though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order ; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon 's will , though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it ; strange as these suppositions appear , yet human dignity -- which tells me that each of us is , if not more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon -- demands the acceptance of that solution of the question , and historic investigation abundantly confirms it . 
At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one . 
That was all done by the soldiers . 
Therefore it was not he who killed people . 
The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodino not because of Napoleon 's orders but by their own volition . 
The whole army -- French , Italian , German , Polish , and Dutch -- hungry , ragged , and weary of the campaign , felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk . 
Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians , they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable . 
When they heard Napoleon 's proclamation offering them , as compensation for mutilation and death , the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before Moscow , they cried `` Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
just as they had cried `` Vive l'Empereur ! ''
