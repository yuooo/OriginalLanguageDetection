`` About your sister , '' ejaculated Denisov testily . 
Rostov smiled . 
`` My dear count , you were one of my best pupils -- you must dance , '' said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas . 
`` Look how many charming young ladies - '' He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a former pupil of his . 
`` No , my dear fellow , I 'll be a wallflower , '' said Denisov . 
`` Do n't you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons ? '' 
`` Oh no ! '' 
said Iogel , hastening to reassure him . 
`` You were only inattentive , but you had talent -- oh yes , you had talent ! ''
