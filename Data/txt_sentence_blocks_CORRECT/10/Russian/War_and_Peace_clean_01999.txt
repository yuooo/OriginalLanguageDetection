It 's all a trick , '' said Dunyasha , `` and when Yakov Alpatych returns let us get away ... and please do n't ... '' `` What is a trick ? '' 
asked Princess Mary in surprise . 
`` I know it is , only listen to me for God 's sake ! 
Ask nurse too . 
They say they do n't agree to leave Bogucharovo as you ordered . '' 
`` You 're making some mistake . 
I never ordered them to go away , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Call Dronushka . '' 
Dron came and confirmed Dunyasha 's words ; the peasants had come by the princess ' order . 
`` But I never sent for them , '' declared the princess .
