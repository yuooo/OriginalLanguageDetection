Holy Father , I am indignant with you . 
Confession is a great sacrament , before which I am ready to bow down reverently ; but there in the cell , they all kneel down and confess aloud . 
Can it be right to confess aloud ? 
It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in secret : then only your confession will be a mystery , and so it was of old . 
But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that ... well , you understand what - sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it - so it is really a scandal ! 
No , Fathers , one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants , I dare say ... . 
at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod , and I shall take my son , Alexey , home . '' 
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak spot . 
There had been at one time malicious rumours which had even reached the Archbishop -LRB- not only regarding our monastery , but in others where the institution of elders existed -RRB- that too much respect was paid to the elders , even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior , that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on - absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere . 
But the spirit of folly , which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearing him on the current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy , prompted him with this old slander .
