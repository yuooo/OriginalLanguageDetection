Thanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became general and lively , and she did not talk to her husband . 
When they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess , Countess Mary held out her hand and kissed her husband , and asked him why he was angry with her . 
`` You always have such strange fancies ! 
I did n't even think of being angry , '' he replied . 
But the word always seemed to her to imply : `` Yes , I am angry but I wo n't tell you why . '' 
Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sonya and the old countess , who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree , could find nothing to reproach them with ; but even they had their moments of antagonism . 
Occasionally , and it was always just after they had been happiest together , they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility , which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary 's pregnancies , and this was such a time . 
`` Well , messieurs et mesdames , '' said Nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness -LRB- it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex her -RRB- , `` I have been on my feet since six this morning . 
Tomorrow I shall have to suffer , so today I 'll go and rest . '' 
And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa .
