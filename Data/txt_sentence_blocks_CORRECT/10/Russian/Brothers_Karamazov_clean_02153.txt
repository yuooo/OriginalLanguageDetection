I took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later ... '' `` Then you did take - but you have not given it back yet ... or have you ? '' 
`` That 's of no consequence , '' muttered Rakitin , `` I refuse to answer such questions ... .

The President intervened , but Fetyukovitch declared he had no more questions to ask of the witness . 
Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box not absolutely without a stain upon his character .

Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to Grushenka , he suddenly shouted `` Bernard ! '' 
When , after Rakitin 's cross-examination , the President asked the prisoner if he had anything to say , Mitya cried loudly : `` Since I 've been arrested , he has borrowed money from me !
