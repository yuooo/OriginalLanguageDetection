And they did indeed get somewhere , though not to their right places ; a few eventually even got to their right place , but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at . 
Toll , who in this battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz , galloped assiduously from place to place , finding everything upside down everywhere . 
Thus he stumbled on Bagovut 's corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight , though the corps should long before have joined Orlov-Denisov . 
Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it , Toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely , saying that he ought to be shot . 
General Bagovut , a fighting old soldier of placid temperament , being also upset by all the delay , confusion , and cross-purposes , fell into a rage to everybody 's surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll . 
`` I prefer not to take lessons from anyone , but I can die with my men as well as anybody , '' he said , and advanced with a single division . 
Coming out onto a field under the enemy 's fire , this brave general went straight ahead , leading his men under fire , without considering in his agitation whether going into action now , with a single division , would be of any use or no . 
Danger , cannon balls , and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood . 
One of the first bullets killed him , and other bullets killed many of his men . 
And his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly .
