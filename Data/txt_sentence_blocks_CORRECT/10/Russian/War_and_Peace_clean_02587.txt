`` Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it . 
And above all , what tact and grace ! '' 
thought Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment , she would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself . 
From the moment she recognized that dear , loved face , a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will . 
From the time Rostov entered , her face became suddenly transformed . 
It was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate , skillful , artistic work on its sides , that previously seemed dark , coarse , and meaningless , was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty . 
For the first time all that pure , spiritual , inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface . 
All her inward labor , her dissatisfaction with herself , her sufferings , her strivings after goodness , her meekness , love , and self-sacrifice -- all this now shone in those radiant eyes , in her delicate smile , and in every trait of her gentle face . 
Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life .
