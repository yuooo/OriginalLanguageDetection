Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen , or even if Kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen . 
In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow 's action , and new men would come to the front . 
So Boris was full of nervous vivacity all day . 
After Kaysarov , others whom Pierre knew came up to him , and he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon him , or to listen to all that was told him . 
The faces all expressed animation and apprehension , but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success ; his mind , however , was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces -- an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death . 
Kutuzov noticed Pierre 's figure and the group gathered round him . 
`` Call him to me , '' said Kutuzov . 
An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness ' wish , and Pierre went toward Kutuzov 's bench . 
But a militiaman got there before him .
