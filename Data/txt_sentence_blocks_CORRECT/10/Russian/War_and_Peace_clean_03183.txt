So that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and , receiving a justification , presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men . 
In whatever direction a ship moves , the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it . 
To those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion . 
Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship , and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving . 
We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters -LRB- that is , re-establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs -- the continuity of movement in time -RRB- and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses . 
When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it , when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently . 
But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement . 
Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed . 
Wherever the ship may go , the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it , and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship 's movement also . 
Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which , as commands , were related to events , historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands .
