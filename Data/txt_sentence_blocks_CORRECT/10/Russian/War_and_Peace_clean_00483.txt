But a freak of fate made the impossible possible . 
The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way . 
Meeting Bagration 's weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov 's whole army . 
To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna , and with this object offered a three days ' truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving . 
Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding , and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed . 
Count Nostitz , the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts , believed Murat 's emissary and retired , leaving Bagration 's division exposed . 
Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days ' truce . 
Bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer he had received . 
A truce was Kutuzov 's sole chance of gaining time , giving Bagration 's exhausted troops some rest , and letting the transport and heavy convoys -LRB- whose movements were concealed from the French -RRB- advance if but one stage nearer Znaim . 
The offer of a truce gave the only , and a quite unexpected , chance of saving the army .
