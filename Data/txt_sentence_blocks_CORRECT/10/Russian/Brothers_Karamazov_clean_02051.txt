He had no watch , but he had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black ribbon . 
On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it . 
Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation . 
The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his room to keep his host company at tea , and was discreetly silent , seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied . 
But he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it . 
All at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude . 
`` I say , '' he began to Ivan , `` excuse me , I only mention it to remind you . 
You went to Smerdyakov 's to find out about Katerina Ivanovna , but you came away without finding out anything about her , you probably forgot - '' `` Ah , yes . '' 
broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness . 
`` Yes , I 'd forgotten ... but it does n't matter now , never mind , till to-morrow , '' he muttered to himself , `` and you , '' he added , addressing his visitor , `` I should have remembered that myself in a minute , for that was just what was tormenting me !
