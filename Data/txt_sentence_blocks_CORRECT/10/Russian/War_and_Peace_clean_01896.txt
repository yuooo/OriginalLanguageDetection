When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince 's eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written . 
He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich 's hand , put it in his pocket , folded up his papers , and called in Alpatych who had long been waiting . 
The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and , walking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door , he gave his instructions . 
`` First , notepaper -- do you hear ? 
Eight quires , like this sample , gilt-edged ... it must be exactly like the sample . 
Varnish , sealing wax , as in Michael Ivanovich 's list . '' 
He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes . 
`` Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed . '' 
Next , bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed , and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the `` will '' in . 
The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go .
