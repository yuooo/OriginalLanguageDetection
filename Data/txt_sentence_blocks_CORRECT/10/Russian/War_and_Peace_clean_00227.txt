The twitching increased , the handsome mouth was drawn to one side -LRB- only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was -RRB- , and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct , hoarse sound . 
Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick man 's eyes , trying to guess what he wanted ; she pointed first to Pierre , then to some drink , then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring whisper , then pointed to the quilt . 
The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience . 
He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed . 
`` Wants to turn on the other side , '' whispered the servant , and got up to turn the count 's heavy body toward the wall . 
Pierre rose to help him . 
While the count was being turned over , one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward . 
Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm , or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain , at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm , at Pierre 's terror-stricken face , and again at the arm , and on his face a feeble , piteous smile appeared , quite out of keeping with his features , that seemed to deride his own helplessness . 
At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose , and tears dimmed his eyes . 
The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall .
