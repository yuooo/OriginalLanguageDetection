The President and the prosecutor , of course , tried to calm her . 
I ca n't help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria and of listening to such avowals . 
I remember hearing them say to her , `` We understand how hard it is for you ; be sure we are able to feel for you , '' and so on , and so on . 
And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving , hysterical woman . 
She described at last with extraordinary clearness , which is so often seen , though only for a moment , in such overwrought states , how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last two months trying to save `` the monster and murderer , '' his brother . 
`` He tortured himself , '' she exclaimed , `` he was always trying to minimise his brother 's guilt and confessing to me that he , too , had never loved his father , and perhaps desired his death himself . 
Oh , he has a tender , over-tender conscience ! 
He tormented himself with his conscience ! 
He told me everything , everything ! 
He came every day and talked to me as his only friend .
