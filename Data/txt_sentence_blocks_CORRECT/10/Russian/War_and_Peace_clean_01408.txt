Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse , accompanied by two hunt servants . 
Instead of an enemy , Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count 's acquaintance . 
Having ridden up to Nicholas , Ilagin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else 's borzois . 
He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited him to draw his covert . 
Natasha , afraid that her brother would do something dreadful , had followed him in some excitement . 
Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings , she rode up to them . 
Ilagin lifted his beaver cap still higher to Natasha and said , with a pleasant smile , that the young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty , of which he had heard much . 
To expiate his huntsman 's offense , Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and which , he said , swarmed with hares . 
Nicholas agreed , and the hunt , now doubled , moved on . 
The way to Iligin 's upland was across the fields .
