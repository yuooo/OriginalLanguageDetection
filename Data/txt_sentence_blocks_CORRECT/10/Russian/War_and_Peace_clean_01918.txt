The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate . 
With lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads . 
Several people came round the corner talking eagerly . 
`` What force ! '' 
remarked one . 
`` Knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters ! '' 
`` Routed up the earth like a pig , '' said another . 
`` That 's grand , it bucks one up ! '' 
laughed the first . 
`` Lucky you jumped aside , or it would have wiped you out ! ''
