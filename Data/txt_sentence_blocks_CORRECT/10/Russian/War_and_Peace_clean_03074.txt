`` Perhaps he is not asleep ; I 'll have an explanation with him , '' she said to herself . 
Little Andrew , her eldest boy , imitating his mother , followed her on tiptoe . 
She not notice him . 
`` Mary , dear , I think he is asleep -- he was so tired , '' said Sonya , meeting her in the large sitting room -LRB- it seemed to Countess Mary that she crossed her path everywhere -RRB- . 
`` Andrew may wake him . '' 
Countess Mary looked round , saw little Andrew following her , felt that Sonya was right , and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh . 
She made no reply , but to avoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door . 
Sonya went away by another door . 
From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing , every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife . 
As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead , his mustache , and his whole face , as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept .
