I love your face , Alyosha . 
Did you know that I loved your face ? 
And he is myself , Alyosha . 
All that 's base in me , all that 's mean and contemptible . 
Yes , I am a romantic . 
He guessed it ... though it 's a libel . 
He is frightfully stupid ; but it 's to his advantage . 
He has cunning , animal cunning - he knew how to infuriate me . 
He kept taunting me with believing in him , and that was how he made me listen to him . 
He fooled me like a boy .
