All that day he sat in the same place , almost without stirring . 
When it got dark and the shutters were closed , Fenya asked her mistress : `` Is the gentleman going to stay the night , mistress ? '' 
`` Yes ; make him a bed on the sofa , '' answered Grushenka . 
Questioning him more in detail , Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go , and that `` Mr. Kalganov , my benefactor , told me straight that he would n't receive me again and gave me five roubles . '' 
`` Well , God bless you , you 'd better stay , then , '' Grushenka decided in her grief , smiling compassionately at him . 
Her smile wrung the old man 's heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears . 
And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since . 
He did not leave the house even when she was ill . 
Fenya and her grandmother , the cook , did not turn him out , but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa . 
Grushenka had grown used to him , and coming back from seeing Mitya -LRB- whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well -RRB- she would sit down and begin talking to `` Maximushka '' about trifling matters , to keep her from thinking of her sorrow .
