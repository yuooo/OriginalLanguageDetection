`` I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got money from his father , '' she went on . 
`` I have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money matters . 
He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his father , and spoke to me several times about it . 
I knew he had a feud with his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father . 
I do n't remember any threat uttered by him against his father . 
He certainly never uttered any such threat before me . 
If he had come to me at that time , I should have at once relieved his anxiety about that unlucky three thousand roubles , but he had given up coming to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite him ... . 
And I had no right , indeed , to be exacting as to that money , she added suddenly , and there was a ring of resolution in her voice . 
`` I was once indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand , and I took it , although I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a position to repay my debt . ''
