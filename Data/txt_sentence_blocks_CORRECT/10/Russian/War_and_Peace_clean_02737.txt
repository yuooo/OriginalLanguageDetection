In the corporal 's changed face , in the sound of his voice , in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums , he recognized that mysterious , callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men -- that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions . 
To fear or to try to escape that force , to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools , was useless . 
Pierre knew this now . 
One had to wait and endure . 
He did not again go to the sick man , nor turn to look at him , but stood frowning by the door of the hut . 
When that door was opened and the prisoners , crowding against one another like a flock of sheep , squeezed into the exit , Pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him . 
The captain was also in marching kit , and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre had recognized in the corporal 's words and in the roll of the drums . 
`` Pass on , pass on ! '' 
the captain reiterated , frowning sternly , and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him . 
Pierre went up to him , though he knew his attempt would be vain .
