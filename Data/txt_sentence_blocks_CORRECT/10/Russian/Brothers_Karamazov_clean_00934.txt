`` I have proofs , great proofs . 
I shall show them . '' 
Then I cried and kissed him . 
`` Tell me one thing , one thing , '' he said -LRB- as though it all depended upon me -RRB- , `` my wife , my children ! 
My wife may die of grief , and though my children wo n't lose their rank and property , they 'll be a convict 's children and for ever ! 
And what a memory , what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts ! '' 
I said nothing . 
`` And to part from them , to leave them for ever ? 
It 's for ever , you know , for ever ! '' 
I sat still and repeated a silent prayer .
