Oh , how I curse myself for not having come before '' muttered Kolya , crying , and no longer ashamed of it . 
At that moment the captain flew out of the room , and at once closed the door behind him . 
His face looked frenzied , his lips were trembling . 
He stood before the two and flung up his arms . 
`` I do n't want a good boy ! 
I do n't want another boy ! '' 
he muttered in a wild whisper , clenching his teeth . 
`` If I forget thee , knees before the wooden bench . 
Pressing his fists against his head , he began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries , doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in the room . 
Kolya ran out into the street .
