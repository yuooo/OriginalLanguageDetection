hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched , but could see nothing except the people about him . 
All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm .

`` Father ! 
Angel ! 
Dear one ! '' 
she kept repeating , wiping away her tears with her fingers . 
`` Hurrah ! ''
