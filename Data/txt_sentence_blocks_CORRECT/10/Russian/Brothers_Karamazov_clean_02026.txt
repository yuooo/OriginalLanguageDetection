And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came out , and he suddenly gave a scream , and then all was silence and darkness . 
I lay there waiting , my heart beating ; I could n't bear it . 
I got up at last , went out . 
I saw the window open on the left into the garden , and I stepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive , and I heard the master moving about , sighing , so I knew he was alive . 
` Ech ! ' 
I thought . 
I went to the window and shouted to the master , ` It 's I. ' And he shouted to me , ` He 's been , he 's been ; he 's run away . ' 
He meant Dmitri Fyodorovitch had been . 
` He 's killed Grigory ! 
`` Where ? '
