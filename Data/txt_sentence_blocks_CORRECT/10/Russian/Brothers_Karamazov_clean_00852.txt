But here I. . . 
it 's not the time for me to go now ... . 
You see , I 've two pieces of copse land there . 
The Maslovs , an old merchant and his son , will give eight thousand for the timber . 
But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve . 
There 's no getting anyone about here to buy it . 
The Maslovs have it all their own way . 
One has to take what they 'll give , for no one here dare bid against them . 
The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday that a merchant called Gorstkin , a man I know , had turned up . 
What makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts , so he is not afraid of the Maslovs .
