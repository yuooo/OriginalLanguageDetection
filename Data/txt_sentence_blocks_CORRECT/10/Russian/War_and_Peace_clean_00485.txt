March on , destroy the Russian army ... . 
You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery . 
The Russian Emperor 's aide-de-camp is an impostor . 
Officers are nothing when they have no powers ; this one had none ... . 
The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge , you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor . 
NAPOLEON Bonaparte 's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat . 
Bonaparte himself , not trusting to his generals , moved with all the Guards to the field of battle , afraid of letting a ready victim escape , and Bagration 's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires , dried and warmed themselves , cooked their porridge for the first time for three days , and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him . 
Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew , who had persisted in his request to Kutuzov , arrived at Grunth and reported himself to Bagration . 
Bonaparte 's adjutant had not yet reached Murat 's detachment and the battle had not yet begun . 
In Bagration 's detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs .
