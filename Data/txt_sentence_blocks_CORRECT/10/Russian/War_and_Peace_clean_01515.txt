One day in Moscow in Princess Mary 's presence -LRB- she thought her father did it purposely when she was there -RRB- the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne 's hand and , drawing her to him , embraced her affectionately . 
Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room . 
A few minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary 's room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice . 
Princess Mary hastily wiped away her tears , went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne , and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman , her voice breaking : `` It 's horrible , vile , inhuman , to take advantage of the weakness ... '' She did not finish . 
`` Leave my room , '' she exclaimed , and burst into sobs . 
Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter , but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be served first . 
After dinner , when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess , the prince suddenly grew furious , threw his stick at Philip , and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army . 
`` He does n't obey ... I said it twice ... and he does n't obey ! 
She is the first person in this house ; she 's my best friend , '' cried the prince . 
`` And if you allow yourself , '' he screamed in a fury , addressing Princess Mary for the first time , `` to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday , I will show you who is master in this house .
