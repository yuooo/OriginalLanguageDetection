Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance , to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit . 
`` I should like to see the great man , '' he said , alluding to Napoleon , whom hitherto he , like everyone else , had always called Buonaparte . 
`` You are speaking of Buonaparte ? '' 
asked the general , smiling . 
Boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested . 
`` I am speaking , Prince , of the Emperor Napoleon , '' he replied . 
The general patted him on the shoulder , with a smile . 
`` You will go far , '' he said , and took him to Tilsit with him . 
Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two Emperors met . 
He saw the raft , decorated with monograms , saw Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river , saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon 's arrival , saw both Emperors get into boats , and saw how Napoleon - reaching the raft first -- stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him , and how they both retired into the pavilion .
