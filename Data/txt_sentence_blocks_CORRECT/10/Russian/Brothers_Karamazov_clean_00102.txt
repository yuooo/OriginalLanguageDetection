She sighed deeply . 
`` My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you . 
` Foolish one , ' he said , ` why weep ? 
Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before God . ' 
He says that to me , but he weeps himself . 
I see that he cries like me . ' 
I know , Nikita , ' said I. ` Where could he be if not with the Lord God ? 
Only , here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before . ' 
And if only I could look upon him one little time , if only I could peep at him one little time , without going up to him , without speaking , if I could be hidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute , hear him playing in the yard , calling in his little voice , ` Mammy , where are you ? ' 
If only I could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room just once , only once ; for so often , so often I remember how he used to run to me and shout and laugh , if only I could hear his little feet I should know him !
