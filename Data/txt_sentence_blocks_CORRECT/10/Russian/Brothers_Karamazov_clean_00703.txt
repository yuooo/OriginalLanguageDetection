After a moment 's silence the guitar tinkled again , and he sang again in the same falsetto : Whatever you may say , I shall go far away . 
Life will be bright and gay In the city far away . 
I shall not grieve , I shall not grieve at all , I do n't intend to grieve at all . 
Then something unexpected happened . 
Alyosha suddenly sneezed . 
They were silent . 
Alyosha got up and walked towards them . 
He found Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots , his hair pomaded , and perhaps curled . 
The guitar lay on the garden-seat . 
His companion was the daughter of the house , wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long .
