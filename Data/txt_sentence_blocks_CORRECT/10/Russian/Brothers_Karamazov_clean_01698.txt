`` Oh well , my boy , your Zhutchka 's lost and done for ! '' 
Ilusha did not speak , but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya . 
Alyosha , catching Kolya 's eye , signed to him vigourously again , but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed . 
`` It must have run away and died somewhere . 
It must have died after a meal like that , '' Kolya pronounced pitilessly , though he seemed a little breathless . 
`` But I 've got a dog , Perezvon ... A Slavonic name ... I 've brought him to show you . '' 
`` I do n't want him ! '' 
said Ilusha suddenly . 
`` No , no , you really must see him ... it will amuse you . 
I brought him on purpose ... .
