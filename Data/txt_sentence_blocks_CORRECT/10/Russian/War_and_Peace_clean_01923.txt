As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in Ferapontov 's open shop , talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds . 
Just then Ferapontov returned and entered his shop . 
On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them , but suddenly stopped and , clutching at his hair , burst into sobs and laughter : `` Loot everything , lads ! 
Do n't let those devils get it ! '' 
he cried , taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street . 
Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away , others went on filling their bags . 
On seeing Alpatych , Ferapontov turned to him : `` Russia is done for ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Alpatych , I 'll set the place on fire myself . 
We 're done for !
