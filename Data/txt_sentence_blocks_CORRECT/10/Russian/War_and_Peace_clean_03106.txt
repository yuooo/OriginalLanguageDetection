But those glances expressed something more : they said that she had played her part in life , that what they now saw was not her whole self , that we must all become like her , and that they were glad to yield to her , to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves , but now so much to be pitied . 
`` Memento mori , '' said these glances . 
Only the really heartless , the stupid ones of that household , and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her . 
When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience , and so -- though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an absence : `` High time , my dear , high time ! 
We were all weary of waiting for you . 
Well , thank God ! '' 
and received her presents with another customary remark : `` It 's not the gift that 's precious , my dear , but that you give it to me , an old woman ... '' -- yet it was evident that she was not pleased by Pierre 's arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game . 
She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents . 
They consisted of a box for cards , of splendid workmanship , a bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid , and a gold snuffbox with the count 's portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg . 
The countess had long wished for such a box , but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards .
