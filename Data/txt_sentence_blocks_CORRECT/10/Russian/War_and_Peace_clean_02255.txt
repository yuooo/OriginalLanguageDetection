The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring . 
Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself , and at every moment of this continuous , uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues , worries , contingencies , authorities , projects , counsels , threats , and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him , which constantly conflict with one another . 
Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov should have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching Fili , and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him . 
But a commander in chief , especially at a difficult moment , has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously . 
And all these proposals , based on strategics and tactics , contradict each other . 
A commander in chief 's business , it would seem , is simply to choose one of these projects . 
But even that he can not do . 
Events and time do not wait . 
For instance , on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the Kaluga road , but just then an adjutant gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire . 
An order must be given him at once , that instant .
