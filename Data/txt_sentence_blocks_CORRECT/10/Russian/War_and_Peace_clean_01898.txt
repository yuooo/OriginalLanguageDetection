Every place seemed unsatisfactory , but worst of all was his customary couch in the study . 
That couch was dreadful to him , probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there . 
It was unsatisfactory everywhere , but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places : he had never slept there yet . 
With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up . 
`` That 's not right ! 
That 's not right ! '' 
cried the prince , and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again . 
`` Well , at last I 've finished , now I 'll rest , '' thought the prince , and let Tikhon undress him . 
Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers , the prince undressed , sat down heavily on the bed , and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs . 
He was not meditating , but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed .
