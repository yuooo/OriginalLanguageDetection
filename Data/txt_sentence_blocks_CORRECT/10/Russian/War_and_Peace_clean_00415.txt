You should dismount , '' he said . 
`` Oh , every bullet has its billet , '' answered Vaska Denisov , turning in his saddle . 
Meanwhile Nesvitski , Zherkov , and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots , watching , now the small group of men with yellow shakos , dark-green jackets braided with cord , and blue riding breeches , who were swarming near the bridge , and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side - the blue uniforms and groups with horses , easily recognizable as artillery . 
`` Will they burn the bridge or not ? 
Who 'll get there first ? 
Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out ? '' 
These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart -- watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns . 
`` Ugh . 
The hussars will get it hot ! '' 
said Nesvitski ; `` they are within grapeshot range now . ''
