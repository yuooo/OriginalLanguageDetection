I mean Katerina Ivanovna . 
I am afraid , oh , I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand . 
She 'll pay it back to the last farthing . 
I do n't want her sacrifice ; they 'll put me to shame at the trial . 
I wonder how I can stand it . 
Go to her , Alyosha , ask her not to speak of that in the court , ca n't you ? 
But damn it all , it does n't matter ! 
I shall get through somehow . 
I do n't pity her . 
It 's her own doing .
