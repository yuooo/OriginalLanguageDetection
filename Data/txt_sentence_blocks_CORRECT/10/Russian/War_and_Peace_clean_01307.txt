The old people sat with the old , the young with the young , and the hostess at the tea table , on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the Panins had at their party . 
Everything was just as it was everywhere else . 
Pierre , as one of the principal guests , had to sit down to boston with Count Rostov , the general , and the colonel . 
At the card table he happened to be directly facing Natasha , and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball . 
She was silent , and not only less pretty than at the ball , but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around . 
`` What 's the matter with her ? '' 
thought Pierre , glancing at her . 
She was sitting by her sister at the tea table , and reluctantly , without looking at him , made some reply to Boris who sat down beside her . 
After playing out a whole suit and to his partner 's delight taking five tricks , Pierre , hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks , glanced again at Natasha . 
`` What has happened to her ? ''
