The grown-up members of the family , not to mention his wife , were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully . 
The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them , and especially that Natasha would now be herself again . 
Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations . 
Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men , Pierre , with the aid of a list his wife drew up , had now bought everything , not forgetting his mother -- and brother-in-law 's commissions , nor the dress material for a present to Belova , nor toys for his wife 's nephews . 
In the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy , and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything . 
But in time he grew used to this demand . 
Knowing that Natasha asked nothing for herself , and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them , he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house , and never forgot anything . 
If he now incurred Natasha 's censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things . 
To her other defects -LRB- as most people thought them , but which to Pierre were qualities -RRB- of untidiness and neglect of herself , she now added stinginess . 
From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure , he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before , and that his affairs -- which had been in disorder of late , chiefly because of his first wife 's debts - had begun to improve .
