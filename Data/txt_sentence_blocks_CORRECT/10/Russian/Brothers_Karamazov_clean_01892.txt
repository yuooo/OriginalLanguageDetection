It 's God that 's worrying me . 
That 's the only thing that 's worrying me . 
What if He does n't exist ? 
What if Rakitin 's right - that it 's an idea made up by men ? 
Then if He does n't exist , man is the chief of the earth , of the universe . 
Magnificent ! 
Only how is he going to be good without God ? 
That 's the question . 
I always come back to that . 
For whom is man going to love then ?
