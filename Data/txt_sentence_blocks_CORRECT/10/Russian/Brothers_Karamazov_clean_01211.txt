I should like to have a chat with you , my dear boy , but I have n't the time . 
And there 's no need , it 's too late for talking . 
Where 's my money ? 
Where have I put it ? '' 
he cried , thrusting his hands into his pockets . 
`` You put it on the table ... yourself ... . 
Here it is . 
Had you forgotten ? 
Money 's like dirt or water to you , it seems . 
Here are your pistols .
