`` Do you suppose he 'd think much of that , with his temper , which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday ? 
He says if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there , I 'll be the first to suffer for it .

`` His honour said to him the other day , ` I 'll pound you in a mortar ! ' ''

`` Oh , if it 's pounding in a mortar , it may be only talk , '' observed Alyosha . 
`` If I could meet him , I might speak to him about that too . ''
