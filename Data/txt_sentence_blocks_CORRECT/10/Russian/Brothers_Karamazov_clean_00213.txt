Do n't you understand that one might very well dislike him , apart from Katerina Ivanovna . 
And why the devil should I like him ? 
He condescends to abuse me , you know . 
Why have n't I a right to abuse him ? '' 
`` I never heard of his saying anything about you , good or bad . 
He does n't speak of you at all . '' 
`` But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna 's he was abusing me for all he was worth - you see what an interest he takes in your humble servant . 
And which is the jealous one after that , brother , I ca n't say . 
He was so good as to express the opinion that , if I do n't go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and do n't become a monk , I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer , that I shall write for the next ten years , and in the end become the owner of the magazine , and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic side , with a socialistic tinge , with a tiny gloss of socialism , but keeping a sharp lookout all the time , that is , keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the fools . 
According to your brother 's account , the tinge of socialism wo n't hinder me from laying by the proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew , till at the end of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing offices to it , and let out the upper stories to lodgers .
