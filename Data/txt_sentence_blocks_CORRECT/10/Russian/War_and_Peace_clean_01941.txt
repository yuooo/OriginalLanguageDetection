It is pitiable and sad , and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned . 
I , for my part , begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him , but nothing would induce him to consent . 
I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smolensk . 
Our troops fought , and are fighting , as never before . 
With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him ; but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours . 
It is disgraceful , a stain on our army , and as for him , he ought , it seems to me , not to live . 
If he reports that our losses were great , it is not true ; perhaps about four thousand , not more , and not even that ; but even were they ten thousand , that 's war ! 
But the enemy has lost masses ... What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days ? 
They would have had to retire of their own accord , for they had no water for men or horses . 
He gave me his word he would not retreat , but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night .
