`` That 's always the way , '' thought Countess Mary . 
`` He talks to everyone except me . 
I see ... I see that I am repulsive to him , especially when I am in this condition . '' 
She looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale , sallow , emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever . 
And everything annoyed her -- Denisov 's shouting and laughter , Natasha 's talk , and especially a quick glance Sonya gave her . 
Sonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling irritated . 
Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying , she softly left the room and went to the nursery . 
The children were playing at `` going to Moscow '' in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them . 
She sat down and played with them a little , but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her . 
She got up and , walking on tiptoe with difficulty , went to the small sitting room .
