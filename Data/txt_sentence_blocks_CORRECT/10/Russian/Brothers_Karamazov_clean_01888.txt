I go for all , because someone must go for all . 
I did n't kill father , but I 've got to go . 
I accept it . 
It 's all come to me here , here , within these peeling walls . 
There are numbers of them there , hundreds of them underground , with hammers in their hands . 
Oh , yes , we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom , but then , in our great sorrow , we shall rise again to joy , without which man can not live nor God exist , for God gives joy : it 's His privilege - a grand one . 
Ah , man should be dissolved in prayer ! 
What should I be underground there without God ? 
Rakitin 's laughing ! 
If they drive God from the earth , we shall shelter Him underground .
