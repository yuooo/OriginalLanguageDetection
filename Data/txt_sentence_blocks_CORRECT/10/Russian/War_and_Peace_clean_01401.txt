Nicholas and his attendant , with `` Uncle '' and his huntsman , were all riding round the wolf , crying `` ulyulyu ! '' 
shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back , and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe . 
Already , at the beginning of this chase , Daniel , hearing the ulyulyuing , had rushed out from the wood . 
He saw Karay seize the wolf , and checked his horse , supposing the affair to be over . 
But when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety , Daniel set his chestnut galloping , not at the wolf but straight toward the wood , just as Karay had run to cut the animal off . 
As a result of this , he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by `` Uncle 's '' borzois . 
Daniel galloped up silently , holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail . 
Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut , breathing heavily , panted past him , and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel lying on the wolf 's back among the dogs , trying to seize her by the ears . 
It was evident to the dogs , the hunters , and to the wolf herself that all was now over . 
The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise , but the borzois stuck to her .
