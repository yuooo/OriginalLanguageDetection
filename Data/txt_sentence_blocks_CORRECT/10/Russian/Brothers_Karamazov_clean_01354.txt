Maximov , it appeared , could not tear himself away from the girls , only running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur . 
He had drunk two cups of chocolate . 
His face was red , and his nose was crimson ; his eyes were moist , and mawkishly sweet.He ran up and announced that he was going to dance the `` sabotiere . '' 
`` They taught me all those well-bred , aristocratic dances when I was little ... '' `` Go , go with him , Mitya , and I 'll watch from here how he dances , '' said Grushenka . 
`` No , no , I 'm coming to look on , too , '' exclaimed Kalganov , brushing aside in the most naive way Grushenka 's offer to sit with him . 
They all went to look on . 
Maximov danced his dance . 
But it roused no great admiration in anyone but Mitya . 
It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping , kicking the feet , and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot . 
Kalgonov did not like it at all , but Mitya kissed the dancer .
