We can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable , '' said the adjutant . 
`` Will you come ? '' 
`` Yes , I 'll come with you , '' replied Pierre , looking round for his groom . 
It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers . 
On that very meadow he had ridden over the day before , a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay , with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off . 
`` Why have n't they carried him away ? '' 
Pierre was about to ask , but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way , he checked himself . 
Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to Raevski 's Redoubt . 
His horse lagged behind the adjutant 's and jolted him at every step . 
`` You do n't seem to be used to riding , Count ? ''
