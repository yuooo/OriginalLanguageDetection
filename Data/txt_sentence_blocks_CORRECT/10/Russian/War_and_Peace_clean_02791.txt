All the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with Denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer -- without hinting at their previous acquaintance . 
But as soon as Denisov smiled at him Petya brightened up , blushed with pleasure , forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing , and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near Vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there . 
`` Well , I am glad to see you , '' Denisov interrupted him , and his face again assumed its anxious expression . 
`` Michael Feoklitych , '' said he to the esaul , `` this is again fwom that German , you know . 
He '' -- he indicated Petya -- `` is serving under him . '' 
And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the German general 's demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport . 
`` If we do n't take it tomowwow , he 'll snatch it fwom under our noses , '' he added . 
While Denisov was talking to the esaul , Petya -- abashed by Denisov 's cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers -- furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it , while maintaining as martial an air as possible . 
`` Will there be any orders , your honor ? '' 
he asked Denisov , holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself , `` or shall I remain with your honor ? ''
