Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand , speaking of the princess ' sorrow and making herself a partner in it . 
She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow , that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief ; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone , and that he , from above , saw her affection and gratitude . 
The princess heard her , not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice . 
`` Your position is doubly terrible , dear princess , '' said Mademoiselle Bourienne after a pause . 
`` I understand that you could not , and can not , think of yourself , but with my love for you I must do so ... . 
Has Alpatych been to you ? 
Has he spoken to you of going away ? '' 
she asked . 
Princess Mary did not answer . 
She did not understand who was to go or where to .
