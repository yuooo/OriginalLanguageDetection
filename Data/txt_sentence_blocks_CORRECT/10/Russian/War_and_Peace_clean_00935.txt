`` Seize the moments of happiness , love and be loved ! 
That is the only reality in the world , all else is folly . 
It is the one thing we are interested in here , '' said the spirit of the place . 
Nicholas , having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses , without visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited , returned home just before dinner . 
As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house , and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present . 
Sonya , Dolokhov , and the old countess were especially disturbed , and to a lesser degree Natasha . 
Nicholas understood that something must have happened between Sonya and Dolokhov before dinner , and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner . 
On that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel -LRB- the dancing master -RRB- gave for his pupils durings the holidays . 
`` Nicholas , will you come to Iogel 's ? 
Please do ! ''
