... Well , you will be coming , '' he was going to say , `` to dine , '' but changed his mind and said `` to take tea with us , '' and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke , perfectly embodying his dream of happiness . 
After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg 's proposal , the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family , but the rejoicing was external and insincere . 
In the family 's feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident , as if they were ashamed of not having loved Vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands .

He would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment , but it resulted from the state of his affairs . 
He did not know at all how much he had , what his debts amounted to , or what dowry he could give Vera . 
When his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them , for her dowry , an estate with three hundred serfs ; but one of these estates had already been sold , and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold , so that it was impossible to give it to Vera . 
Nor had he any money .
