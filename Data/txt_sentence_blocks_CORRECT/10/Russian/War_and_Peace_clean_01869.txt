Scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators , a man without a tooth in his head , with a shrewd though angry expression , standing near the first speaker , interrupted him . 
Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument , he began in low but distinct tones : `` I imagine , sir , '' said he , mumbling with his toothless mouth , `` that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it 's best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia . 
We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us . 
But to judge what is best -- conscription or the militia -- we can leave to the supreme authority ... '' Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement . 
He hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility . 
Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him . 
He himself did not yet know what he would say , but he began to speak eagerly , occasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian . 
`` Excuse me , your excellency , '' he began . 
-LRB- He was well acquainted with the senator , but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally . -RRB- 
`` Though I do n't agree with the gentleman ... '' -LRB- he hesitated : he wished to say , `` Mon tres honorable preopinant '' -- `` My very honorable opponent '' -RRB- `` with the gentleman ... whom I have not the honor of knowing , I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our Fatherland !
