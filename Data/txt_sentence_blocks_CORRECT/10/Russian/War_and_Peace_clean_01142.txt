Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back . 
`` Why , this one seems ... '' he began , turning to the assistant . 
`` And how we 've been begging , your honor , '' said the old soldier , his jaw quivering . 
`` He 's been dead since morning . 
After all we 're men , not dogs . '' 
`` I 'll send someone at once . 
He shall be taken away -- taken away at once , '' said the assistant hurriedly . 
`` Let us go , your honor . '' 
`` Yes , yes , let us go , '' said Rostov hastily , and lowering his eyes and shrinking , he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him , and went out of the room . 
Going along the corridor , the assistant led Rostov to the officers ' wards , consisting of three rooms , the doors of which stood open .
