As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn , Rostov and Ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor 's cart , from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out , and in the middle of which his wife 's nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible . 
`` She really is a dear little thing , '' said Rostov to Ilyin , who was following him . 
`` A charming woman ! '' 
said Ilyin , with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen . 
Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road . 
The command was heard to `` mount '' and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted . 
Rostov riding in front gave the order `` Forward ! '' 
and the hussars , with clanking sabers and subdued talk , their horses ' hoofs splashing in the mud , defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side , following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front . 
Tattered , blue-purple clouds , reddening in the east , were scudding before the wind . 
It was growing lighter and lighter .
