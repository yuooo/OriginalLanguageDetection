`` So that 's all there is in what is called heroism ! 
And heroism ! 
And did I do it for my country 's sake ? 
And how was he to blame , with his dimple and blue eyes ? 
And how frightened he was ! 
He thought that I should kill him . 
Why should I kill him ? 
My hand trembled . 
And they have given me a St. George 's Cross ... . 
I ca n't make it out at all . ''
