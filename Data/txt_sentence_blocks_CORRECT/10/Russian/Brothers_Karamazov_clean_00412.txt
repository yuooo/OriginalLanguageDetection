And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri . 
But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples , tugged at them , and flung him with a crash on the floor . 
He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face . 
The old man moaned shrilly . 
Ivan , though not so strong as Dmitri , threw his arms round him , and with all his might pulled him away . 
Alyosha helped him with his slender strength , holding Dmitri in front . 
`` Madman ! 
You 've killed him ! '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Serve him right ! ''
