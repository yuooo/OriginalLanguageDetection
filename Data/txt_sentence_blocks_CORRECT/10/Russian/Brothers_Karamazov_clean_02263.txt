You saw the recent scene : you have seen the witness 's condition . 
He was standing up and was speaking , but where was his mind ? 
`` Then followed the document , the prisoner 's letter written two days before the crime , and containing a complete programme of the murder . 
Why , then , are we looking for any other programme ? 
The crime was committed precisely according to this programme , and by no other than the writer of it . 
Yes , gentlemen of the jury , it went off without a hitch ! 
He did not run respectfully and timidly away from his father 's window , though he was firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him . 
No , that is absurd and unlikely ! 
He went in and murdered him .
