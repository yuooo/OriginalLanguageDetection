The strange thought that of the thousands of men , young and old , who had stared with merry surprise at his hat -LRB- perhaps the very men he had noticed -RRB- , twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed Pierre . 
`` They may die tomorrow ; why are they thinking of anything but death ? '' 
And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozhaysk hill , the carts with the wounded , the ringing bells , the slanting rays of the sun , and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind . 
`` The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them , but pass by , winking at the wounded . 
Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die , and they wonder at my hat ! 
Strange ! '' 
thought Pierre , continuing his way to Tatarinova . 
In front of a landowner 's house to the left of the road stood carriages , wagons , and crowds of orderlies and sentinels . 
The commander in chief was putting up there , but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there -- they had gone to the church service . 
Pierre drove on toward Gorki .
