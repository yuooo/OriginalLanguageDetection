Here 's your father and your brother Ivan after him . 
They 've broken out from the Father Superior 's . 
And look , Father Isidor 's shouting out something after them from the steps . 
And your father 's shouting and waving his arms . 
I expect he 's swearing . 
Bah , and there goes Miusov driving away in his carriage . 
You see , he 's going . 
And there 's old Maximov running ! 
- there must have been a row . 
There ca n't have been any dinner .
