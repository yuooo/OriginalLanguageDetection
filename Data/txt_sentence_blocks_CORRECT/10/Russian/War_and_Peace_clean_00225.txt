After a few minutes ' bustle beside the high bedstead , those who had carried the sick man dispersed . 
Anna Mikhaylovna touched Pierre 's hand and said , `` Come . '' 
Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed . 
He lay with his head propped high on the pillows . 
His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt , the palms downward . 
When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him , but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man . 
Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere , or it meant too much . 
Pierre hesitated , not knowing what to do , and glanced inquiringly at his guide . 
Anna Mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes , glancing at the sick man 's hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss . 
Pierre , carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt , followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned , fleshy hand .
