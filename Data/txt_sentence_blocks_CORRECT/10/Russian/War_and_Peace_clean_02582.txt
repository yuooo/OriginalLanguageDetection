Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts -LRB- which he would not have told to his mother , his sister , or his friend -RRB- to this woman who was almost a stranger . 
When he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him , it seemed to him -- as it seems to everyone in such cases -- that it was merely some silly whim that seized him : yet that burst of frankness , together with other trifling events , had immense consequences for him and for all his family . 
`` You see , Aunt , Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress , but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me . '' 
`` Oh yes , I understand , '' said the governor 's wife . 
`` But Princess Bolkonskaya -- that 's another matter . 
I will tell you the truth . 
In the first place I like her very much , I feel drawn to her ; and then , after I met her under such circumstances -- so strangely , the idea often occurred to me : ` This is fate . ' 
Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it ; but I had never happened to meet her before , somehow it had always happened that we did not meet . 
And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her . 
And it must needs happen that I should meet her just when Natasha 's engagement had been broken off ... and then everything ... So you see ... I never told this to anyone and never will , only to you . ''
