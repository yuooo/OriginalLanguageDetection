In riotous orgies and debauchery , receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return . 
You have become the possessor of wealth . 
How have you used it ? 
What have you done for your neighbor ? 
Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of slaves ? 
Have you helped them physically and morally ? 
No ! 
You have profited by their toil to lead a profligate life . 
That is what you have done . 
Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor ?
