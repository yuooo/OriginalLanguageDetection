Look round and judge ; fifteen centuries have passed , look upon them . 
Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself ? 
I swear , man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him ! 
Can he , can he do what Thou didst ? 
By showing him so much respect , Thou didst , as it were , cease to feel for him , for Thou didst ask far too much from him - Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself ! 
Respecting him less , Thou wouldst have asked less of him . 
That would have been more like love , for his burden would have been lighter . 
He is weak and vile . 
What though he is everywhere now rebelling against our power , and proud of his rebellion ? 
It is the pride of a child and a schoolboy .
