Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for . 
`` Oh , but you were there ? '' 
said Prince Bagration , addressing Prince Andrew . 
`` Of course , we only just missed one another , '' said the staff officer , with a smile to Bolkonski . 
`` I had not the pleasure of seeing you , '' said Prince Andrew , coldly and abruptly . 
All were silent . 
Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals . 
As he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut , feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors , he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it . 
Several of those present laughed . 
`` How was it a gun was abandoned ? ''
