Marya Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out : `` Go away ! 
Go away ! 
You all hate and despise me ! '' 
and she threw herself back on the sofa . 
Marya Dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time , enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only Natasha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened . 
Natasha did not reply , nor did she sob any longer , but she grew cold and had a shivering fit . 
Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under her head , covered her with two quilts , and herself brought her some lime-flower water , but Natasha did not respond to her . 
`` Well , let her sleep , '' said Marya Dmitrievna as she went of the room supposing Natasha to be asleep . 
But Natasha was not asleep ; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she looked straight before her . 
All that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to her several times .
