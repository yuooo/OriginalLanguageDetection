Berg had already been engaged a month , and only a week remained before the wedding , but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry , nor spoken to his wife about it . 
At one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of selling a forest , at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand . 
A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count 's study early one morning and , with a pleasant smile , respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what Vera 's dowry would be . 
The count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head . 
`` I like your being businesslike about it ... . 
I like it . 
You shall be satisfied ... '' And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up , wishing to end the conversation . 
But Berg , smiling pleasantly , explained that if he did not know for certain how much Vera would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance , he would have to break matters off . 
`` Because , consider , Count -- if I allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife , I should be acting badly ... '' The conversation ended by the count , who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity , saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles . 
Berg smiled meekly , kissed the count on the shoulder , and said that he was very grateful , but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money .
