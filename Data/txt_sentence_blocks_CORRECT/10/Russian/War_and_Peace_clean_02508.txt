The shouting in the tavern had died down ; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard . 
Natasha sat up . 
`` Sonya , are you asleep ?

The boards of the floor creaked . 
Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle . 
It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room : it was her own heart , sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love .
