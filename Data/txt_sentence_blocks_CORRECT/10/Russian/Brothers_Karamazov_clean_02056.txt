`` Yes , that was a moment of weakness ... but I could n't believe in you . 
I do n't know whether I was asleep or awake last time . 
Perhaps I was only dreaming then and did n't see you really at all - '' `` And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now ? 
He is a dear ; I 've treated him badly over Father Zossima . '' 
`` Do n't talk of Alyosha ! 
How dare you , you flunkey ! '' 
Ivan laughed again . 
`` You scold me , but you laugh - that 's a good sign . 
But you are ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why : that great resolution of yours - '' `` Do n't speak of my resolution , '' cried Ivan , savagely . 
`` I understand , I understand , c'est noble , c'est charmant , you are going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... C'est chevaleresque . ''
