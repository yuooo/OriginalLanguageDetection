Even Grushenka 's two servants -LRB- after the catastrophe of which we will speak later -RRB- testified in court that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because `` he threatened to murder her . '' 
These servants were an old cook , invalidish and almost deaf , who came from Grushenka 's old home , and her granddaughter , a smart young girl of twenty , who performed the duties of a maid . 
Grushenka lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious . 
Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820 , belonging to her landlady . 
It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms , yet they were not lighted up . 
Grushenka was lying down in her drawing-room on the big , hard , clumsy sofa , with a mahogany back . 
The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather . 
Under her head she had two white down pillows taken from her bed . 
She was lying stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind her head . 
She was dressed as though expecting someone , in a black silk dress , with a dainty lace fichu on her head , which was very becoming .
