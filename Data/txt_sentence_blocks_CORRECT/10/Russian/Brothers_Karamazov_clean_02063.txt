Listen , in dreams and especially in nightmares , from indigestion or anything , a man sees sometimes such artistic visions , such complex and real actuality , such events , even a whole world of events , woven into such a plot , with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff , as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented . 
Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers , but by the most ordinary people , officials , journalists , priests ... . 
The subject is a complete enigma . 
A statesman confessed to me , indeed , that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep . 
Well , that 's how it is now , though I am your hallucination , yet just as in a nightmare , I say original things which had not entered your head before . 
So I do n't repeat your ideas , yet I am only your nightmare , nothing more . '' 
* It 's new , is n't it ? 
`` You are lying , your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my nightmare , and now you are asserting you are a dream . '' 
`` My dear fellow , I 've adopted a special method to-day , I 'll explain it to you afterwards . 
Stay , where did I break off ?
