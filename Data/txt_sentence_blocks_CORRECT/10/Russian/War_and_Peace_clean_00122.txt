Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her , the first he had ever written . 
Boris and Natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered . 
Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty , happy faces . 
It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love ; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera . 
`` How often have I asked you not to take my things ? '' 
she said . 
`` You have a room of your own , '' and she took the inkstand from Nicholas . 
`` In a minute , in a minute , '' he said , dipping his pen . 
`` You always manage to do things at the wrong time , '' continued Vera . 
`` You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you . ''
