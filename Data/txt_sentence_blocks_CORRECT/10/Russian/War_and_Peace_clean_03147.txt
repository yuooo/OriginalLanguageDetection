Only nonsense . '' 
`` But all the same ? '' 
`` Oh nothing , only a trifle , '' said Natasha , smilingly still more brightly . 
`` I only wanted to tell you about Petya : today nurse was coming to take him from me , and he laughed , shut his eyes , and clung to me . 
I 'm sure he thought he was hiding . 
Awfully sweet ! 
There , now he 's crying . 
Well , good-by ! '' 
and she left the room .
