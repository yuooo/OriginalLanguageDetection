`` Fire , Medvedev ! '' 
Bagration called to him , and Tushin , raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest 's benediction , approached the general . 
Though Tushin 's guns had been intended to cannonade the valley , he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite , in front of which large masses of French were advancing . 
No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire , but after consulting his sergeant major , Zakharchenko , for whom he had great respect , he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village . 
`` Very good ! '' 
said Bagration in reply to the officer 's report , and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him . 
The French had advanced nearest on our right . 
Below the height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed , in the hollow where the rivulet flowed , the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard , and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons , the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us . 
To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood .
