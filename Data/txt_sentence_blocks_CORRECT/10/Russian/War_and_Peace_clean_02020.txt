`` I can not express , Princess , how glad I am that I happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you , '' said Rostov , rising . 
`` Go when you please , and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort . '' 
And bowing respectfully , as if to a lady of royal blood , he moved toward the door . 
Rostov 's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her , he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her . 
Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy . 
`` I am very , very grateful to you , '' she said in French , `` but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it . '' 
She suddenly began to cry . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
she said . 
Rostov , knitting his brows , left the room with another low bow .
