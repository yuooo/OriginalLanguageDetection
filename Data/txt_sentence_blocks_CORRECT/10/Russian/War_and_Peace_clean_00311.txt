shouted the regimental commander , thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth , which contrasted with the others . 
`` What have you been after ? 
The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place ? 
Eh ? 
I 'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade ... . 
Eh ... ? '' 
The commander of the company , with his eyes fixed on his superior , pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap , as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation . 
`` Well , why do n't you speak ? 
Whom have you got there dressed up as a Hungarian ? ''
