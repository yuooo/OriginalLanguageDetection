She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired , without any idea of what she had been asked . 
Kolya showed the powder and the shot . 
The captain , as a military man , undertook to load it , putting in a minute quantity of powder . 
He asked that the shot might be put off till another time . 
The cannon was put on the floor , aiming towards an empty part of the room , three grains of powder were thrust into the touchhole and a match was put to it . 
A magnificent explosion followed . 
Mamma was startled , but at once laughed with delight . 
The boys gazed in speechless triumph .
