He is lying to me , shameless deceiver , that 's what it is ! 
And he was jealous of me just now , so as to put the blame on me afterwards . 
He is stupid , he ca n't disguise what he is doing ; he is so open , you know ... . 
But I 'll give it to him , I 'll give it to him ! 
` You believe I did it , ' he said . 
He said that to me , to me . 
He reproached me with that ! 
God forgive him ! 
You wait , I 'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial ! 
I 'll just say a word then ... I 'll tell everything then ! ''
