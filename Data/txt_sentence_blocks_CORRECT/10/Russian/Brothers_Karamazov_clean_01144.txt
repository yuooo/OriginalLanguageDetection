Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour . 
For , even if the rival did disappear next day , he would invent another one and would be jealous of him . 
And one might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched over , what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding . 
But that the jealous will never understand . 
And yet among them are men of noble hearts . 
It is remarkable , too , that those very men of noble hearts , standing hidden in some cupboard , listening and spying , never feel the stings of conscience at that moment , anyway , though they understand clearly enough with their `` noble hearts '' the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk . 
At the sight of Grushenka , Mitya 's jealousy vanished , and , for an instant he became trustful and generous , and positively despised himself for his evil feelings . 
But it only proved that , in his love for the woman , there was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined , that it was not only a sensual passion , not only the `` curve of her body , '' of which he had talked to Alyosha . 
But , as soon as Grushenka had gone , Mitya began to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness , and he felt no sting of conscience at it . 
And so jealousy surged up in him again .
