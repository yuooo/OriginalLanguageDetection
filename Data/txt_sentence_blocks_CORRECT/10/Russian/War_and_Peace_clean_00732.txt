He really was asleep . 
Weyrother , with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment , glanced at Kutuzov and , having convinced himself that he was asleep , took up a paper and in a loud , monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle , under a heading which he also read out : `` Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz , November 30 , 1805 . '' 
The dispositions were very complicated and difficult . 
They began as follows : `` As the enemy 's left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there , while we , on the other hand , with our left wing by far outflank his right , it is advantageous to attack the enemy 's latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz , whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest , avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy 's front . 
For this object it is necessary that ... The first column marches ... The second column marches ... The third column marches ... '' and so on , read Weyrother . 
The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions . 
The tall , fair-haired General Buxhowden stood , leaning his back against the wall , his eyes fixed on a burning candle , and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen . 
Exactly opposite Weyrother , with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards , sat the ruddy Miloradovich in a military pose , his elbows turned outwards , his hands on his knees , and his shoulders raised . 
He remained stubbornly silent , gazing at Weyrother 's face , and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading . 
Then Miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals .
