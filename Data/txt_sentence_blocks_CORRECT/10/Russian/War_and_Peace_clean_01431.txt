Anisya Fedorovna , with her light step , willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar . 
Without looking at anyone , `` Uncle '' blew the dust off it and , tapping the case with his bony fingers , tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair . 
He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard , arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture , and , with a wink at Anisya Fedorovna , struck a single chord , pure and sonorous , and then quietly , smoothly , and confidently began playing in very slow time , not My Lady , but the well-known song : Came a maiden down the street . 
The tune , played with precision and in exact time , began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha , arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna 's whole being . 
Anisya Fedorovna flushed , and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room . 
`` Uncle '' continued to play correctly , carefully , with energetic firmness , looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna had just stood . 
Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches , especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when , here and there , as he ran his fingers over the strings , something seemed to snap .
