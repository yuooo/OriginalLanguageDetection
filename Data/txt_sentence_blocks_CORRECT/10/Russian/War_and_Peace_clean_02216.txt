Dinner was brought him . 
Adjutant General Wolzogen , the man who when riding past Prince Andrew had said , `` the war should be extended widely , '' and whom Bagration so detested , rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner . 
Wolzogen had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank . 
The sagacious Barclay de Tolly , seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army , weighed all the circumstances , concluded that the battle was lost , and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news . 
Kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids . 
Wolzogen , nonchalantly stretching his legs , approached Kutuzov with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips , scarcely touching the peak of his cap . 
He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that , as a highly trained military man , he left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man , but that he knew whom he was dealing with . 
`` Der alte Herr '' -LRB- as in their own set the Germans called Kutuzov -RRB- `` is making himself very comfortable , '' thought Wolzogen , and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutuzov he began to report to `` the old gentleman '' the position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it . 
`` All the points of our position are in the enemy 's hands and we can not dislodge them for lack of troops , the men are running away and it is impossible to stop them , '' he reported . 
Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen , as if not understand what was said to him .
