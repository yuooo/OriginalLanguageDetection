But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics , even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space , in time , and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history , while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics . 
In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability , what is unknown to us we call vital force . 
Vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life . 
So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability , what is unknown we call free will . 
Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life . 
History examines the manifestations of man 's free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause , that is , it defines this freedom by the laws of reason , and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws . 
The recognition of man 's free will as something capable of influencing historical events , that is , as not subject to laws , is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy . 
That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws , that is , of any science whatever . 
If there is even a single body moving freely , then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists . 
If any single action is due to free will , then not a single historical law can exist , nor any conception of historical events .
