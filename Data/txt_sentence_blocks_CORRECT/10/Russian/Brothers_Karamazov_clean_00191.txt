Father Zossima raised his hand to bless him . 
Alyosha could make no protest , though he had a great longing to remain . 
He longed , moreover , to ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri , the question was on the tip of his tongue , but he dared not ask it . 
He knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had thought fit . 
But evidently it was not his will . 
That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha ; he believed blindly in its mysterious significance . 
Mysterious , and perhaps awful . 
As he hastened out of the hermatage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior 's dinner , he felt a sudden pang at his heart , and stopped short . 
He seemed to hear again Father Zossima 's words , foretelling his approaching end . 
What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass .
