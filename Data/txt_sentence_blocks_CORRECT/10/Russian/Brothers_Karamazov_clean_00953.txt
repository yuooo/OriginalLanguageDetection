And yet how many meek and humble monks there are , yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace ! 
These are less noticed , or passed over in silence . 
And how suprised men would be if I were to say that from these meek monks , who yearn for solitary prayer , the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more ! 
For they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet `` for the day and the hour , the month and the year . '' 
Meanwhile , in their solitude , they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled , in the purity of God 's truth , from the times of the Fathers of old , the Apostles and the martyrs . 
And when the time comes they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world . 
That is a great thought . 
That star will rise out of the East . 
That is my view of the monk , and is it false ? 
Is it too proud ?
