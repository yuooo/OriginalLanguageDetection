And Tikhon , purposely writhing and making faces , pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses . 
The only effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners . 
He was the bravest and most useful man in the party . 
No one found more opportunities for attacking , no one captured or killed more Frenchmen , and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role . 
Now he had been sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a `` tongue . '' 
But whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night , he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and , as Denisov had witnessed from above , had been detected by them . 
After talking for some time with the esaul about next day 's attack , which now , seeing how near they were to the French , he seemed to have definitely decided on , Denisov turned his horse and rode back . 
`` Now , my lad , we 'll go and get dwy , '' he said to Petya . 
As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped , peering into the forest . 
Among the trees a man with long legs and long , swinging arms , wearing a short jacket , bast shoes , and a Kazan hat , was approaching with long , light steps .
