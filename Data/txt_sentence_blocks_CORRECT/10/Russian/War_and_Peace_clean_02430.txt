A vein in the young man 's long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear , and suddenly his face flushed . 
All eyes were fixed on him . 
He looked at the crowd , and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there , he smiled sadly and timidly , and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step . 
`` He has betrayed his Tsar and his country , he had gone over to Bonaparte . 
He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name , he has caused Moscow to perish , '' said Rostopchin in a sharp , even voice , but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude . 
As if inflamed by the sight , he raised his arm and addressed the people , almost shouting : `` Deal with him as you think fit ! 
I hand him over to you . '' 
The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another . 
To keep one another back , to breathe in that stifling atmosphere , to be unable to stir , and to await something unknown , uncomprehended , and terrible , was becoming unbearable . 
Those standing in front , who had seen and heard what had taken place before them , all stood with wide open eyes and mouths , straining with all their strength , and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them .
