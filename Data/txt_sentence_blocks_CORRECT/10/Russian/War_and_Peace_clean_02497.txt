One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was Little Mytishchi burning -- set on fire by Mamonov 's Cossacks . 
`` But look here , brothers , there 's another fire ! '' 
remarked an orderly . 
All turned their attention to the glow . 
`` But they told us Little Mytishchi had been set on fire by Mamonov 's Cossacks . '' 
`` But that 's not Mytishchi , it 's farther away . '' 
`` Look , it must be in Moscow ! '' 
Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down on its steps . 
`` It 's more to the left , why , Little Mytishchi is over there , and this is right on the other side . '' 
Several men joined the first two .
