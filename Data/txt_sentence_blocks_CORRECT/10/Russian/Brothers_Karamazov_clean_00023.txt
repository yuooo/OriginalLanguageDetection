From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a corner to read , and yet he was a general favourite all the while he was at school . 
He was rarely playful or merry , but anyone could see at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness . 
On the contrary he was bright and good-tempered . 
He never tried to show off among his schoolfellows . 
Perhaps because of this , he was never afraid of anyone , yet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous . 
He never resented an insult . 
It would happen that an hour after the offence he would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as though nothing had happened between them . 
And it was not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront , but simply that he did not regard it as an affront , and this completely conquered and captivated the boys . 
He had one characteristic which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him , not from malice but because it amused them . 
This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity .
