`` If you will do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday , '' he added , `` I will , after talking with Magnitski , let you know what may interest you , and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you . '' 
Closing his eyes , he bowed a la francaise , without taking leave , and trying to attract as little attention as possible , he left the room . 
During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city . 
On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours . 
The mechanism of life , the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere , absorbed the greater part of his vital energy . 
He did nothing , did not even think or find time to think , but only talked , and talked successfully , of what he had thought while in the country . 
He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles . 
But he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing . 
As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey 's , Speranski produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday , when he received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially . 
To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures , and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove , that he readily believed that in Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man .
