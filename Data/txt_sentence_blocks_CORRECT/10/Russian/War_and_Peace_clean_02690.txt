You have experienced my readiness to reward you . 
That readiness will not weaken in me , but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal , firmness , and success which your intellect , military talent , and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting . 
But by the time this letter , which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg , was dispatched , Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place . 
On the second of October a Cossack , Shapovalov , who was out scouting , killed one hare and wounded another . 
Following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat 's army , encamped there without any precautions .
