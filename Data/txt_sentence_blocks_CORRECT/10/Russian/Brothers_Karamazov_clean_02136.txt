Many of the audience , of course , had not heard of the sudden suicide . 
What struck people most was Mitya 's sudden outburst . 
As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov 's death was made , he cried out aloud from his place : `` He was a dog and died like a dog ! '' 
I remember how his counsel rushed to him , and how the President addressed him , threatening to take stern measures , if such an irregularity were repeated . 
Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times abruptly to his counsel , with no show of regret : `` I wo n't again , I wo n't . 
It escaped me . 
I wo n't do it again . '' 
And , of course , this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the public . 
His character was displayed , and it spoke for itself . 
It was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read .
