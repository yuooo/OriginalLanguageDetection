Though Daniel was not a big man , to see him in a room was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life . 
Daniel himself felt this , and as usual stood just inside the door , trying to speak softly and not move , for fear of breaking something in the master 's apartment , and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling , out into the open under the sky once more . 
Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that the hounds were fit -LRB- Daniel himself wished to go hunting -RRB- , Nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled . 
But just as Daniel was about to go Natasha came in with rapid steps , not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse 's big shawl wrapped round her . 
Petya ran in at the same time . 
`` You are going ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` I knew you would ! 
Sonya said you would n't go , but I knew that today is the sort of day when you could n't help going . '' 
`` Yes , we are going , '' replied Nicholas reluctantly , for today , as he intended to hunt seriously , he did not want to take Natasha and Petya .
