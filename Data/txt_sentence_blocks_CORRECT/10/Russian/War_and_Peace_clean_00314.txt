Where 's your leg ? 
Your leg ? '' 
shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice , while there were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray uniform . 
Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee , looking straight with his clear , insolent eyes in the general 's face . 
`` Why a blue coat ? 
Off with it ... Sergeant major ! 
Change his coat ... the ras ... '' he did not finish . 
`` General , I must obey orders , but I am not bound to endure ... '' Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted . 
`` No talking in the ranks ! 
... No talking , no talking ! ''
