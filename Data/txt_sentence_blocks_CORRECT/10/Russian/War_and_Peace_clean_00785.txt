shouted Prince Andrew , and , scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard , he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him . 
And really he only ran a few steps alone . 
One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
and overtook him . 
A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew 's hands , but he was immediately killed . 
Prince Andrew again seized the standard and , dragging it by the staff , ran on with the battalion . 
In front he saw our artillerymen , some of whom were fighting , while others , having abandoned their guns , were running toward him . 
He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round . 
Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon . 
He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped .
