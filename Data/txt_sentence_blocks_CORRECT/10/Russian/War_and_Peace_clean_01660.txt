The valet brought a woman 's fox-lined cloak . 
`` Fool , I told you the sable one ! 
Hey , Matrena , the sable ! '' 
he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms . 
A handsome , slim , and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue-black hair , wearing a red shawl , ran out with a sable mantle on her arm . 
`` Here , I do n't grudge it -- take it ! '' 
she said , evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak . 
Dolokhov , without answering , took the cloak , threw it over Matrena , and wrapped her up in it . 
`` That 's the way , '' said Dolokhov , `` and then so ! '' 
and he turned the collar up round her head , leaving only a little of the face uncovered .
