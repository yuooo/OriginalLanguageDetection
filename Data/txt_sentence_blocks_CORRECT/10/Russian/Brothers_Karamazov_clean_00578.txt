Nothing but yesterday 's insult . '' 
Madame Hohlakov obviously had not intended to interfere , but she could not refrain from this very just comment . 
`` Quite so , quite so , '' cried Ivan , with peculiar eagerness , obviously annoyed at being interrupted , `` in anyone else this moment would be only due to yesterday 's impression and would be only a moment . 
But with Katerina Ivanovna 's character , that moment will last all her life . 
What for anyone else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting burdensome , grim perhaps , but unflagging duty . 
And she will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled . 
Your life , Katerina Ivanovna , will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings , your own heroism , and your own suffering ; but in the end that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfilment of a bold and proud design . 
Yes , proud it certainly is , and desperate in any case , but a triumph for you . 
And the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else . '' 
This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention ; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with intention .
