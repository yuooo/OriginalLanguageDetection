`` From the direction , it must be the enemy , '' repeated Rostov . 
`` It may be he or it may be nothing , '' muttered the hussar . 
`` It 's dark ... Steady ! '' 
he cried to his fidgeting horse .

The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce . 
The lights spread farther and farther , probably along the line of the French camp . 
Rostov no longer wanted to sleep . 
The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him .
