His sobs ceased , he pointed to his eyes , and Tikhon , understanding him , wiped away the tears . 
Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time , till at last Tikhon understood and repeated it . 
Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking . 
She thought he was speaking of Russia , or Prince Andrew , of herself , of his grandson , or of his own death , and so she could not guess his words . 
`` Put on your white dress . 
I like it , '' was what he said . 
Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder , and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda , soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey . 
When she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son , about the war , and about the Emperor , angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice , and then he had a second and final stroke . 
Princess Mary stayed on the veranda . 
The day had cleared , it was hot and sunny .
