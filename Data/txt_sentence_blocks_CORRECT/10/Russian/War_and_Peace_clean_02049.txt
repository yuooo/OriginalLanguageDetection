He was listening to the general 's report -- which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche -- as he had listened to Denisov , and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war . 
He evidently listened only because he had ears which , though there was a piece of tow in one of them , could not help hearing ; but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him , that he knew all that would be said beforehand , and heard it all only because he had to , as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer . 
All that Denisov had said was clever and to the point . 
What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point , but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness , and knew of something else that would decide the matter -- something independent of cleverness and knowledge . 
Prince Andrew watched the commander in chief 's face attentively , and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom , curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door , and a desire to observe propriety . 
It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov , but despised them not because of his own intellect , feelings , or knowledge -- he did not try to display any of these -- but because of something else . 
He despised them because of his old age and experience of life . 
The only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops . 
At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers , when landowners lodged petitions for compensation . 
After hearing the matter , Kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head .
