There were rumours that she had been at seventeen betrayed by someone , some sort of officer , and immediately afterwards abandoned by him . 
The officer had gone away and afterwards married , while Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace . 
It was said , however , that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man , Samsonov , she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical class , that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort . 
And now after four years the sensitive , injured and pathetic little orphan had become a plump , rosy beauty of the Russian type , a woman of bold and determined character , proud and insolent . 
She had a good head for business , was acquisitive , saving and careful , and by fair means or foul had succeeded , it was said , in amassing a little fortune . 
There was only , one point on which all were agreed . 
Grushenka was not easily to be approached and , except her aged protector , there had not been one man who could boast of her favours during those four years . 
It was a positive fact , for there had been a good many , especially during the last two years , who had attempted to obtain those favours . 
But all their efforts had been in vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and even comic retreat , owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met from the strong-willed young person . 
It was known , too , that the young person had , especially of late , been given to what is called `` speculation , '' and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction , so that many people began to say that she was no better than a Jew .
