The other , younger Pole , who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and listening to the conversation with silent contempt , still only impressed Mitya by his great height , which was in striking contrast to the Pole on the sofa . 
`` If he stood up he 'd be six foot three . '' 
The thought flitted through Mitya 's mind . 
It occurred to him , too , that this Pole must be the friend of the other , as it were , a `` bodyguard , '' and no doubt the big Pole was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe . 
But this all seemed to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned . 
In his mood of doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away . 
Grushenka 's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely failed to grasp . 
All he understood , with thrilling heart , was that she was kind to him , that she had forgiven him , and made him sit by her . 
He was beside himself with delight , watching her sip her glass of champagne .
