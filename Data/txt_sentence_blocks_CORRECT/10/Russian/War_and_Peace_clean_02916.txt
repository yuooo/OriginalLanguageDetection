He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de Stael , read novels , liked the society of pretty women , jested with generals , officers , and soldiers , and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him . 
When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza bridge galloped up to Kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow , and said : `` How was it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle ? '' 
Kutuzov replied : `` And I shall not abandon Moscow without a battle , '' though Moscow was then already abandoned . 
When Arakcheev , coming to him from the Emperor , said that Ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery , Kutuzov replied : `` Yes , I was just saying so myself , '' though a moment before he had said quite the contrary . 
What did it matter to him -- who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening -- what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself ? 
Still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery . 
Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man -- who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people -- use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head . 
But that man , so heedless of his words , did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war . 
Obviously in spite of himself , in very diverse circumstances , he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood . 
Beginning with the battle of Borodino , from which time his disagreement with those about him began , he alone said that the battle of Borodino was a victory , and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death .
