But by some strange chance no one perceives this . 
His part is not yet ended . 
The man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days ' sail from France , which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion , and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him . 
The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels . 
The waves of the great movement abate , and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists , who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate . 
But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed . 
The diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces ; they anticipate war between their sovereigns ; the position seems to them insoluble . 
But the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect . 
It rises again from the same point as before -- Paris . 
The last backwash of the movement from the west occurs : a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history .
