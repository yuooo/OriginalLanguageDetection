`` That is not enough , I told them . 
Something else is needed . 
When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment , when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe , as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity . 
Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved . 
One is lured by women , another by honors , a third by ambition or money , and they go over to that camp . 
No independent men , such as you or I , are left . 
What I say is widen the scope of our society , let the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well ! '' 
Nicholas , who had left his nephew , irritably pushed up an armchair , sat down in it , and listened to Pierre , coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more . 
`` But action with what aim ? '' 
he cried .
