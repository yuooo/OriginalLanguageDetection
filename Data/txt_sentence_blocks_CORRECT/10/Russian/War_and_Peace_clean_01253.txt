`` Why not ? '' 
said Natasha , without changing her position . 
`` Because he is young , because he is poor , because he is a relation ... and because you yourself do n't love him . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` I know . 
It is not right , darling ! '' 
`` But if I want to ... '' said Natasha . 
`` Leave off talking nonsense , '' said the countess .
