`` It 's like this , '' he said thoughtfully , `` if there 's a battle soon , yours will win . 
That 's right . 
But if three days pass , then after that , well , then that same battle will not soon be over . '' 
Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus : `` If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win , but if later , God knows what will happen . '' 
Napoleon did not smile , though he was evidently in high good humor , and he ordered these words to be repeated . 
Lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further , pretending not to know who Napoleon was , added : `` We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world , but we are a different matter ... '' -- without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end . 
The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase , and Bonaparte smiled . 
`` The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile , '' says Thiers . 
After riding a few paces in silence , Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the Emperor himself , to that very Emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids , would affect this enfant du Don .
