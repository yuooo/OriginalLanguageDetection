`` Forgive me ! '' 
she whispered , raising her head and glancing at him . 
`` Forgive me ! '' 
`` I love you , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Forgive ... ! '' 
`` Forgive what ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne ! '' 
faltered Natasha in a scarcely audible , broken whisper , and began kissing his hand more rapidly , just touching it with her lips . 
`` I love you more , better than before , '' said Prince Andrew , lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes .
