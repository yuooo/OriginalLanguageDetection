You have changed so , Andrusha , '' she added , as if to explain such a question . 
She smiled as she uttered his pet name , `` Andrusha . '' 
It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrusha -- the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood . 
`` And where is Lise ? '' 
he asked , answering her question only by a smile . 
`` She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room . 
Oh , Andrew ! 
What a treasure of a wife you have , '' said she , sitting down on the sofa , facing her brother . 
`` She is quite a child : such a dear , merry child . 
I have grown so fond of her . ''
