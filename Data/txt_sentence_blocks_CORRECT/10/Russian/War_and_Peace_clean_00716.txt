He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor . 
He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost . 
He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting arrives . 
Not daring to look round and without looking round , he was ecstatically conscious of his approach . 
He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade , but because as he drew near everything grew brighter , more joyful , more significant , and more festive around him . 
Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around , and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams , he heard his voice , that kindly , calm , and majestic voice that was yet so simple ! 
And as if in accord with Rostov 's feeling , there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor 's voice . 
`` The Pavlograd hussars ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` The reserves , sire ! ''
