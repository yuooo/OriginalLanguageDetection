What would become of him if the Church punished him with her excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law ? 
There could be no more terrible despair , at least for a Russian criminal , for Russian criminals still have faith . 
Though , who knows , perhaps then a fearful thing would happen , perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what would become of him ? 
But the Church , like a tender , loving mother , holds aloof from active punishment herself , as the sinner is too severely punished already by the civil law , and there must be at least someone to have pity on him . 
The Church holds aloof , above all , because its judgment is the only one that contains the truth , and therefore can not practically and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary compromise . 
She can enter into no compact about that . 
The foreign criminal , they say , rarely repents , for the very doctrines of to-day confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime , but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force . 
Society cuts him off completely by a force that triumphs over him mechanically and -LRB- so at least they say of themselves in Europe -RRB- accompanies this exclusion with hatred , forgetfulness , and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring brother . 
In this way , it all takes place without the compassionate intervention of the Church , for in many cases there are no churches there at all , for though ecclesiastics and splendid church buildings remain , the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely . 
So it seems at least in Lutheran countries .
