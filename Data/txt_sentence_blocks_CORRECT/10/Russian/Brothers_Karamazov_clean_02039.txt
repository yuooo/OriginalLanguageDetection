Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side . 
`` Take that money away with you , '' Smerdyakov sighed . 
`` Of course , I shall take it . 
But why do you give it to me , if you committed the murder for the sake of it ? '' 
Ivan looked at him with great surprise . 
`` I do n't want it , '' Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice , with a gesture of refusal . 
`` I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow or , better still , abroad . 
I did dream of it , chiefly because ` all things are lawful . ' 
That was quite right what you taught me , for you talked a lot to me about that . 
For if there 's no everlasting God , there 's no such thing as virtue , and there 's no need of it .
