At these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment . 
But whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon , or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception , at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene Bezukhova 's reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception .

Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman . 
He was that absent-minded crank , a grand seigneur husband who was in no one 's way , and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room , he served , by the contrast he presented to her , as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife .
