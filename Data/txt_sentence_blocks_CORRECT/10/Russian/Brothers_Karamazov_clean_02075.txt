`` You 'd better tell me some anecdote ! '' 
said Ivan miserably . 
`` There is an anecdote precisely on our subject , or rather a legend , not an anecdote . 
You reproach me with unbelief ; you see , you say , yet you do n't believe . 
But , my dear fellow , I am not the only one like that . 
We are all in a muddle over there now and all through your science . 
Once there used to be atoms , five senses , four elements , and then everything hung together somehow . 
There were atoms in the ancient world even , but since we 've learned that you 've discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil knows what , we had to lower our crest . 
There 's a regular muddle , and , above all , superstition , scandal ; there 's as much scandal among us as among you , you know ; a little more in fact , and spying , indeed , for we have our secret police department where private information is received . 
Well , this wild legend belongs to our middle ages - not yours , but ours - and no one believes it even among us , except the old ladies of eighteen stone , not your old ladies I mean , but ours .
