`` Well , Michael Ivanovich , our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it . 
Prince Andrew '' -LRB- he always spoke thus of his son -RRB- `` has been telling me what forces are being collected against him ! 
While you and I never thought much of him . '' 
Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when `` you and I '' had said such things about Bonaparte , but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince 's favorite topic , he looked inquiringly at the young prince , wondering what would follow . 
`` He is a great tactician ! '' 
said the prince to his son , pointing to the architect . 
And the conversation again turned on the war , on Bonaparte , and the generals and statesmen of the day . 
The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics , and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy , successful only because there were no longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him ; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war , but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing , pretending to do something real . 
Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father 's ridicule of the new men , and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure . 
`` The past always seems good , '' said he , `` but did not Suvorov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him , and from which he did not know how to escape ? ''
