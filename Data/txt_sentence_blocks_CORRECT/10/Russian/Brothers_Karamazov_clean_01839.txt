Alyosha , why is it I do n't respect you ? 
I am very fond of you , but I do n't respect you . 
If I respected you , I should n't talk to you without shame , should I ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't believe it . '' 
Lise laughed nervously again ; she spoke rapidly . 
`` I sent your brother , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , some sweets in prison . 
Alyosha , you know , you are quite pretty ! 
I shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you . ''
