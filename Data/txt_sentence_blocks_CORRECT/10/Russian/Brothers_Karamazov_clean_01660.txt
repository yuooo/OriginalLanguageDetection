`` Cleverer than you , '' the peasant answered unexpectedly , with the same gravity . 
`` I doubt it , '' said Kolya , somewhat taken aback . 
`` It 's true , though . '' 
`` Perhaps it is . '' 
`` It is , brother . '' 
`` Good-bye , peasant ! '' 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` There are all sorts of peasants , '' Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence . 
`` How could I tell I had hit on a clever one ? 
I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry . ''
