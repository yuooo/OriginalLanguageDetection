Thrust them aside as she would , questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now , after that . 
These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it . 
She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer , and she tried to pray . 
She assumed an attitude of prayer , looked at the icons , repeated the words of a prayer , but she could not pray . 
She felt that a different world had now taken possession of her -- the life of a world of strenuous and free activity , quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer . 
She could not pray , could not weep , and worldly cares took possession of her . 
It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo . 
News of the approach of the French came from all sides , and in one village , ten miles from Bogucharovo , a homestead had been looted by French marauders . 
The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince ; the provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible , and the head of the rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing , saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away , that French proclamations were circulating in the villages , and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth , he could not answer for the consequences . 
The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth .
