She was sure he would speak soft , tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death , and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence . 
Yet sooner or later it had to be , and she went in . 
The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features , and then she saw his face and met his gaze . 
He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan , surrounded by pillows . 
He was thin and pale . 
In one thin , translucently white hand he held a handkerchief , while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown , moving his fingers slowly . 
His eyes gazed at them as they entered . 
On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary 's pace suddenly slackened , she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased . 
She suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes . 
`` But in what am I to blame ? ''
