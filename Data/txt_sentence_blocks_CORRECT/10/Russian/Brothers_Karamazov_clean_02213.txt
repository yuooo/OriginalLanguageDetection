`` And he only wanted to marry me , because I 'd inherited a fortune , because of that , because of that ! 
I always suspected it was because of that ! 
Oh , he is a brute ! 
He was always convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him , because I went to him then , and that he had a right to despise me forever for it , and so to be superior to me - that 's why he wanted to marry me ! 
That 's so , that 's all so ! 
I tried to conquer him by my love - a love that knew no bounds . 
I even tried to forgive his faithlessness ; but he understood nothing , nothing ! 
How could he understand indeed ? 
He is a monster ! 
I only received that letter the next evening : it was brought me from the tavern - and only that morning , only that morning I wanted to forgive him everything , everything - even his treachery ! ''
