He raised his companion and said something , pointing to his mouth . 
The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen , spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man , and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them . 
The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was Morel , his orderly . 
When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers , who could not understand him . 
Ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire , looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes . 
Occasionally he emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent . 
Morel , pointing to his shoulders , tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed . 
A Russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French officer into his hut to warm him , and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him , Ramballe was told to go . 
He rose and tried to walk , but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up . 
`` You wo n't do it again , eh ? ''
