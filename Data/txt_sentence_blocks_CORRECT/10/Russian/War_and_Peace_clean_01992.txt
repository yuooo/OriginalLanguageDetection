I should be given a small room as a favor , the soldiers would violate my father 's newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars , they would tell me of their victories over the Russians , and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow ... '' thought Princess Mary , not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother . 
For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her , but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew . 
Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings . 
What they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do . 
She went into Prince Andrew 's study , trying to enter completely into his ideas , and considered her position . 
The demands of life , which had seemed to her annihilated by her father 's death , all at once rose before her with a new , previously unknown force and took possession of her . 
Agitated and flushed she paced the room , sending now for Michael Ivanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron . 
Dunyasha , the nurse , and the other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne 's statement was correct . 
Alpatych was not at home , he had gone to the police . 
Neither could the architect Michael Ivanovich , who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes , tell Princess Mary anything .
