She came up to them . 
`` Vasili Dmitrich , I thank you for the honor , '' she said , with an embarrassed voice , though it sounded severe to Denisov -- `` but my daughter is so young , and I thought that , as my son 's friend , you would have addressed yourself first to me . 
In that case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal . '' 
`` Countess ... '' said Denisov , with downcast eyes and a guilty face . 
He tried to say more , but faltered . 
Natasha could not remain calm , seeing him in such a plight . 
She began to sob aloud . 
`` Countess , I have done w ` ong , '' Denisov went on in an unsteady voice , `` but believe me , I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over ... '' He looked at the countess , and seeing her severe face said : `` Well , good-by , Countess , '' and kissing her hand , he left the room with quick resolute strides , without looking at Natasha . 
Next day Rostov saw Denisov off . 
He not wish to stay another day in Moscow .
