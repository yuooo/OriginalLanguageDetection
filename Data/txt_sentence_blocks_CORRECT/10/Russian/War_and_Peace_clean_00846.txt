`` Dear me ! 
Then what are you up now ? '' 
`` Now ? '' 
repeated Natasha , and a happy smile lit up her face . 
`` Have you seen Duport ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Not seen Duport -- the famous dancer ? 
Well then , you wo n't understand . 
That 's what I 'm up to . '' 
Curving her arms , Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do , ran back a few steps , turned , cut a caper , brought her little feet sharply together , and made some steps on the very tips of her toes .
