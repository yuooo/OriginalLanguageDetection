And such a man says , `` I am fighting for the cause of humanity . '' 
How can such a one fight ? 
What is he fit for ? 
He is capable perhaps of some action quickly over , but he can not hold out long . 
And it 's no wonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery , and instead of serving , the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have fallen , on the contrary , into dissension and isolation , as my mysterious visitor and teacher said to me in my youth . 
And therefore the idea of the service of humanity , of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind , is more and more dying out in the world , and indeed this idea is sometimes treated with derision . 
For how can a man shake off his habits ? 
What can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for himself ? 
He is isolated , and what concern has he with the rest of humanity ? 
They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects , but the joy in the world has grown less .
