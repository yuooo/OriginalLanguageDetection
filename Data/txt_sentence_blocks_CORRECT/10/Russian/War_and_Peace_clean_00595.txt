Prince Vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry , as though what Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in . 
But then the expression of severity changed , and he drew Pierre 's hand downwards , made him sit down , and smiled affectionately . 
`` Well , Lelya ? '' 
he asked , turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood , but which Prince Vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents . 
And he again turned to Pierre . 
`` Sergey Kuzmich -- From all sides - '' he said , unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat . 
Pierre smiled , but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then , and Prince Vasili saw that Pierre knew this . 
He suddenly muttered something and went away . 
It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted . 
The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre : he looked at Helene and she too seemed disconcerted , and her look seemed to say : `` Well , it is your own fault . ''
