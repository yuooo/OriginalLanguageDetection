Now about that door , gentlemen of the jury ... . 
Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that door , and he was at the time in such a condition , that - but supposing the door was open ; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it , from an instinct of self-defence , natural in his position ; supposing he did go into the house - well , what then ? 
How does it follow that because he was there he committed the murder ? 
He might have dashed in , run through the rooms ; might have pushed his father away ; might have struck him ; but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there , he may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed his father . 
And it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptation to kill his father , because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at not having killed him , that he was capable of a pure feeling , the feeling of pity and compassion , and leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after he had , in his excitement , knocked him down . 
`` With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful state of the prisoner 's mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him calling him to new life , while love was impossible for him because he had his father 's bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that corpse - retribution . 
And yet the prosecutor allowed him love , which he explained , according to his method , talking about this drunken condition , about a criminal being taken to execution , about it being still far off , and so on and so on . 
But again I ask , Mr. Prosecutor , have you not invented a new personality ? 
Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape punishment , if his hands were really stained with his father 's blood ? 
No , no , no !
