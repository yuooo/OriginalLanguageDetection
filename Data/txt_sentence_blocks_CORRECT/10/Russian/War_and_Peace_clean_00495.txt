Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying . 
Dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed , with his captain . 
`` Now then , go on , go on ! '' 
incited the officer , bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him . 
`` More , please : more ! 
What 's he saying ? '' 
Dolokhov did not answer the captain ; he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the French grenadier . 
They were naturally talking about the campaign . 
The Frenchman , confusing the Austrians with the Russians , was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm , while Dolokhov maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French . 
`` We have orders to drive you off here , and we shall drive you off , '' said Dolokhov .
