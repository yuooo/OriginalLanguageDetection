`` Mamma , are you cross ? 
Do n't be cross , dear ! 
Is it my fault ? '' 
`` No , but what is it , my dear ? 
Do you want me to go and tell him ? '' 
said the countess smiling . 
`` No , I will do it myself , only tell me what to say . 
It 's all very well for you , '' said Natasha , with a responsive smile . 
`` You should have seen how he said it ! 
I know he did not mean to say it , but it came out accidently . ''
