Helene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic notabilities . 
At Erfurt her success had been brilliant . 
Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her : `` C'est un superbe animal . '' 
* Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre , for she had become even handsomer than before . 
What did surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation `` d' une femme charmante , aussi spirituelle que belle . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters . 
Bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezukhova 's presence . 
To be received in the Countess Bezukhova 's salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect . 
Young men read books before attending Helene 's evenings , to have something to say in her salon , and secretaries of the embassy , and even ambassadors , confided diplomatic secrets to her , so that in a way Helene was a power . 
Pierre , who knew she was very stupid , sometimes attended , with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear , her evenings and dinner parties , where politics , poetry , and philosophy were discussed .
