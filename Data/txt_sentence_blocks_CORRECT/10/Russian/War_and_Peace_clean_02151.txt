An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox , which he took . 
`` Yes , it has happened luckily for you , '' he said , raising the open snuffbox to his nose . 
`` You are fond of travel , and in three days you will see Moscow . 
You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital . 
You will have a pleasant journey . '' 
De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel -LRB- of which he had not till then been aware -RRB- . 
`` Ha , what 's this ? '' 
asked Napoleon , noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth . 
With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his back to the Emperor retired two steps , twitching off the cloth at the same time , and said : `` A present to Your Majesty from the Empress . '' 
It was a portrait , painted in bright colors by Gerard , of the son borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria , the boy whom for some reason everyone called `` The King of Rome . ''
