`` Why do n't you renew the acquaintance ? '' 
said Dolokhov to Rostov . 
`` Confound him , he 's a fool ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` One should make up to the husbands of pretty women , '' said Denisov . 
Pierre did not catch what they were saying , but knew they were talking about him . 
He reddened and turned away . 
`` Well , now to the health of handsome women ! '' 
said Dolokhov , and with a serious expression , but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth , he turned with his glass to Pierre . 
`` Here 's to the health of lovely women , Peterkin -- and their lovers ! ''
