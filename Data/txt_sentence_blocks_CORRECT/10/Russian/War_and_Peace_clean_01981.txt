He a model steward , possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with . 
Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the Bogucharovo commune , by which the Elder had already been carried away . 
But he also knew that Dron , who had acquired property and was hated by the commune , must be hesitating between the two camps : the masters ' and the serfs ' . 
He noticed this hesitation in Dron 's look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him . 
`` Now just listen , Dronushka , '' said he . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense to me . 
His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy , and there is an order from the Tsar about it too . 
Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar . 
Do you hear ? '' 
`` I hear , '' Dron answered without lifting his eyes .
