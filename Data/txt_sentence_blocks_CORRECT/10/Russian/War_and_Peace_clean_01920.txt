At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides , the frightened baby began to cry , and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook . 
The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing .

Do n't let me die ! 
My good souls !

The cook , with her thigh broken by a shell splinter , had been carried into the kitchen . 
Alpatych , his coachman , Ferapontov 's wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar , listening .
