Pierre raised his head . 
In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the dashboard with snow , Anatole and his constant companion Makarin dashed past . 
Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies , the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent . 
His face was fresh and rosy , his white-plumed hat , tilted to one side , disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow . 
`` Yes , indeed , that 's a true sage , '' thought Pierre . 
`` He sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment , nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful , satisfied , and serene . 
What would n't I give to be like him ! '' 
he thought enviously . 
In Marya Dmitrievna 's anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom . 
When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting at the window , with a thin , pale , and spiteful face .
