Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty . 
She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival , so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity , and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty . 
`` No really , my dear , this dress is not pretty , '' said Lise , looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance . 
`` You have a maroon dress , have it fetched . 
Really ! 
You know the fate of your whole life may be at stake . 
But this one is too light , it 's not becoming ! '' 
It was not the dress , but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty , but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this ; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair , the hair combed up , and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress , and so on , all would be well . 
They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered , and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face , it would still remain piteous and plain . 
After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted , just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head -LRB- a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks -RRB- and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf , the little princess walked twice round her , now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand , now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other .
