`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , dear sir , we see you once more ! '' 
`` Stay , Trifon Borissovitch , '' began Mitya , `` first and foremost , where is she ? '' 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ? '' 
The inn-keeper understood at once , looking sharply into Mitya 's face . 
`` She 's here , too ... '' `` With whom ? 
With whom ? '' 
`` Some strangers . 
One is an official gentleman , a Pole , to judge from his speech . 
He sent the horses for her from here ; and there 's another with him , a friend of his , or a fellow traveller , there 's no telling . 
They 're dressed like civilians . ''
