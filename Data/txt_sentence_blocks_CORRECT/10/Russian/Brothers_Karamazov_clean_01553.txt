It was the prosecutor 's turn to be surprised . 
`` Oh , how base that would have been ! 
Gentlemen , do you know , you are torturing me ! 
Let me tell you everything , so be it . 
I 'll confess all my infernal wickedness , but to put you to shame , and you 'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink . 
You must know that I already had that plan myself , that plan you spoke of , just now , prosecutor ! 
Yes , gentlemen , I , too , have had that thought in my mind all this current month , so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya - I was mean enough for that . 
But to go to her , to tell her of my treachery , and for that very treachery , to carry it out , for the expenses of that treachery , to beg for money from her , Katya -LRB- to beg , do you hear , to beg -RRB- , and go straight from her to run away with the other , the rival , who hated and insulted her - to think of it ! 
You must be mad , prosecutor ! '' 
`` Mad I am not , but I did speak in haste , without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case , as you assert ... yes , perhaps there is something of the kind , '' said the prosecutor , smiling .
