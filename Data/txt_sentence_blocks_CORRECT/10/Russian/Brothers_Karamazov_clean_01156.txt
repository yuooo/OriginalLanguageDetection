What do you think of the gold mines , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? '' 
`` Of the gold mines , madam ? 
I have never thought anything about them . '' 
`` But I have thought of them for you . 
Thought of them over and over again . 
I have been watching you for the last month . 
I 've watched you a hundred times as you 've walked past , saying to myself : That 's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold mines . 
I 've studied your gait and come to the conclusion : that 's a man who would find gold . '' 
`` From my gait , madam ? '' 
said Mitya , smiling .
