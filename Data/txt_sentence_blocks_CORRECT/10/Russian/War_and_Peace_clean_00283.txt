To tell the truth , I do n't need her , and she 's even in my way . 
You know I always was a savage , and now am even more so . 
I like being alone ... . 
Father likes her very much . 
She and Michael Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind , because he has been a benefactor to them both . 
As Sterne says : ` We do n't love people so much for the good they have done us , as for the good we have done them . ' 
Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father . 
She is very good-natured , and my father likes her way of reading . 
She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly . '' 
`` To be quite frank , Mary , I expect Father 's character sometimes makes things trying for you , does n't it ? ''
