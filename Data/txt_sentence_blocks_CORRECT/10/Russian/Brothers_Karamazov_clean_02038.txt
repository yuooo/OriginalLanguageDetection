`` We 'll go together , '' Ivan repeated . 
`` And if you wo n't go , no matter , I 'll go alone . '' 
Smerdyakov paused as though pondering . 
`` There 'll be nothing of the sort , and you wo n't go , '' he concluded at last positively . 
`` You do n't understand me , '' Ivan exclaimed reproachfully . 
`` You 'll be too much ashamed , if you confess it all . 
And , what 's more , it will be no use at all , for I shall say straight out that I never said anything of the sort to you , and that you are either ill -LRB- and it looks like it , too -RRB- , or that you 're so sorry for your brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me , for you 've always thought no more of me than if I 'd been a fly . 
And who will believe you , and what single proof have you got ? '' 
`` Listen , you showed me those notes just now to convince me . ''
