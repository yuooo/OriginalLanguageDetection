`` But I do love you ! '' 
answered Alyosha warmly . 
`` And will you weep over me , will you ? ''

`` Not because I wo n't be your wife , but simply weep for me ? ''

`` Thank you ! 
It 's only your tears I want . 
Everyone else may punish me and trample me under foot , everyone , everyone , not excepting anyone .
