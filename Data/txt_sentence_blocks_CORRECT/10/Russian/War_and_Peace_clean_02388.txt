Drones , bumblebees , wasps , and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight . 
Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard . 
Here and there a couple of bees , by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells , with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it . 
In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting , or cleaning themselves , or feeding one another , without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent . 
In a third place a crowd of bees , crushing one another , attack some victim and fight and smother it , and the victim , enfeebled or killed , drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather , among the heap of corpses . 
The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells . 
In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation , he sees hundreds of dull , listless , and sleepy shells of bees . 
They have almost all died unawares , sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more . 
They reek of decay and death . 
Only a few of them still move , rise , and feebly fly to settle on the enemy 's hand , lacking the spirit to die stinging him ; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales .
