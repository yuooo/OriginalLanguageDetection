When he got the telegram , he had , of course , set off post-haste to our town . 
The first to meet him was Alyosha , and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that , in opposition to the general opinion of the town , he refused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya , and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer . 
Later on , after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor , and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest , he was still more surprised at Alyosha , and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya , of whom Alyosha , as Ivan knew , was very fond . 
By the way , let us say a word or two of Ivan 's feeling to his brother Dmitri . 
He positively disliked him ; at most , felt sometimes a compassion for him , and even that was mixed with great contempt , almost repugnance . 
Mitya 's whole personality , even his appearance , was extremely unattractive to him . 
Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna 's love for his brother . 
Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival , and that interview , far from shaking Ivan 's belief in his guilt , positively strengthened it . 
He found his brother agitated , nervously excited . 
Mitya had been talkative , but very absent-minded and incoherent .
