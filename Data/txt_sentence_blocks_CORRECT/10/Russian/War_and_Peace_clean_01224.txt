But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right , then let union with her have only a spiritual aim . 
That is what I decided , and what I wrote to Joseph Alexeevich . 
I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past , to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her , and that I had nothing to forgive . 
It gave me joy to tell her this . 
She need not know how hard it was for me to see her again . 
I have settled on the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration . 
At that time , as always happens , the highest society that met at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles , each with its own particular tone . 
The largest of these was the French circle of the Napoleonic alliance , the circle of Count Rumyantsev and Caulaincourt . 
In this group Helene , as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her husband , took a very prominent place . 
She was visited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners .
