`` I am so tranquil and happy now . '' 
`` Very glad , '' answered Nicholas . 
`` He is an excellent fellow ... . 
And are you very much in love ? '' 
`` How shall I put it ? '' 
replied Natasha . 
`` I was in love with Boris , with my teacher , and with Denisov , but this is quite different . 
I feel at peace and settled . 
I know that no better man than he exists , and I am calm and contented now . 
Not at all as before . ''
