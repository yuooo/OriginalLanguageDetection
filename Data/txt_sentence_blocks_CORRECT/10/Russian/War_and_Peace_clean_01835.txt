He wrote the words L'Empereur Alexandre , La nation russe and added up their numbers , but the sums were either more or less than 666 . 
Once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in French , Comte Pierre Besouhoff , but the sum of the numbers did not come right . 
Then he changed the spelling , substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le , still without obtaining the desired result . 
Then it occurred to him : if the answer to the question were contained in his name , his nationality would also be given in the answer . 
So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671 . 
This was only five too much , and five was represented by e , the very letter elided from the article le before the word Empereur . 
By omitting the e , though incorrectly , Pierre got the answer he sought . 
L'russe Besuhof made 666 . 
This discovery excited him . 
How , or by what means , he was connected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know , but he did not doubt that connection for a moment .
