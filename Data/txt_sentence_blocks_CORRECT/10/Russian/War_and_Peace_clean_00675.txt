With that peculiar feeling of youth , that dread of beaten tracks , and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere , Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend . 
He wanted to pinch him , push him , do anything but kiss him -- a thing everybody did . 
But notwithstanding this , Boris embraced him in a quiet , friendly way and kissed him three times . 
They had not met for nearly half a year and , being at the age when young men take their first steps on life 's road , each saw immense changes in the other , quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps . 
Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them . 
`` Oh , you damned dandies ! 
Clean and fresh as if you 'd been to a fete , not like us sinners of the line , '' cried Rostov , with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice , new to Boris , pointing to his own mud-bespattered breeches . 
The German landlady , hearing Rostov 's loud voice , popped her head in at the door . 
`` Eh , is she pretty ? '' 
he asked with a wink .
