`` If only it were possible for me to see her once more ! 
Just once , looking into those eyes to say ... '' `` Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom ! '' 
flopped the fly ... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world , a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening . 
In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall , something was still stretching out , and the candle with its red halo was still burning , and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door ; but besides all this something creaked , there was a whiff of fresh air , and a new white sphinx appeared , standing at the door . 
And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very Natasha of whom he had just been thinking . 
`` Oh , how oppressive this continual delirium is , '' thought Prince Andrew , trying to drive that face from his imagination . 
But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer . 
Prince Andrew wished to return that former world of pure thought , but he could not , and delirium drew him back into its domain . 
The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur , something oppressed him and stretched out , and the strange face was before him . 
Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses , he moved a little , and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears , a dimness in his eyes , and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness .
