Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskoy . 
As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser - he even felt the heat of the fire . 
Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses . 
He met more people in the streets and they were more excited . 
But Pierre , though he felt that something unusual was happening around him , did not realize that he was approaching the fire . 
As he was going along a foot path across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzinski 's house on the other , Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him . 
He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head . 
By the side of the path , on the dusty dry grass , all sorts of household goods lay in a heap : featherbeds , a samovar , icons , and trunks . 
On the ground , beside the trunks , sat a thin woman no longer young , with long , prominent upper teeth , and wearing a black cloak and cap . 
This woman , swaying to and fro and muttering something , was choking with sobs .
