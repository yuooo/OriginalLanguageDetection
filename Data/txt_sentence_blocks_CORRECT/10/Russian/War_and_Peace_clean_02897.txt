I said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him , but he understood it differently . 
He thought it would be dreadful for me . 
He then still wished to live and feared death . 
And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly ! 
I did not say what I meant . 
I thought quite differently . 
Had I said what I thought , I should have said : even if he had to go on dying , to die continually before my eyes , I should have been happy compared with what I am now . 
Now there is nothing ... nobody . 
Did he know that ? 
No , he did not and never will know it .
