The cares of preparation and giving orders , for which everyone came to her , occupied her all day . 
She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual , without undressing , in the room next to the one where the prince lay . 
Several times , waking up , she heard his groans and muttering , the creak of his bed , and the steps of Tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over . 
Several times she listened at the door , and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener . 
She could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened , wishing to enter but not deciding to do so . 
Though he did not speak , Princess Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him . 
She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him . 
She knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him . 
But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him . 
She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her .
