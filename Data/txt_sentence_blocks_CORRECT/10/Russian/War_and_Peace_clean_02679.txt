When , waking in a cold perspiration , he moved on the divan , Natasha went up and asked him what was the matter . 
He did not answer and looked at her strangely , not understanding . 
That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary 's arrival . 
From that day , as the doctor expressed it , the wasting fever assumed a malignant character , but what the doctor said did not interest Natasha , she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing . 
From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with his awakening from sleep . 
And compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream . 
There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening . 
His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way . 
Both Princess Mary and Natasha , who did not leave him , felt this . 
They did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him -LRB- he was no longer there , he had left them -RRB- but on what reminded them most closely of him -- his body .
