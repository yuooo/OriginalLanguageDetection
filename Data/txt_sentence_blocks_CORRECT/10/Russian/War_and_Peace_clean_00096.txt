Those three got hold of a bear somewhere , put it in a carriage , and set off with it to visit some actresses ! 
The police tried to interfere , and what did the young men do ? 
They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal . 
And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back ! '' 
`` What a nice figure the policeman must have cut , my dear ! '' 
shouted the count , dying with laughter . 
`` Oh , how dreadful ! 
How can you laugh at it , Count ? '' 
Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing . 
`` It was all they could do to rescue the poor man , '' continued the visitor .
