`` Do n't kick up the dust , you infantry ! '' 
jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers . 
`` I 'd like to put you on a two days ' march with a knapsack ! 
Your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed , '' said an infantryman , wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve . 
`` Perched up there , you 're more like a bird than a man . '' 
`` There now , Zikin , they ought to put you on a horse . 
You 'd look fine , '' said a corporal , chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack . 
`` Take a stick between your legs , that 'll suit you for a horse ! '' 
the hussar shouted back .
