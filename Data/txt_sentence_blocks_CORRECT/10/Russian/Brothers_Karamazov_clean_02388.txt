`` Yes , he will get well . 
But she is convinced that he will die . 
She has a great deal of sorrow to bear ... '' A silence followed . 
A grave anxiety was fretting Mitya . 
`` Alyosha , I love Grusha terribly , '' he said suddenly in a shaking voice , full of tears . 
`` They wo n't let her go out there to you , '' Alyosha put in at once . 
`` And there is something else I wanted tell you , '' Mitya went on , with a sudden ring in his voice . 
`` If they beat me on the way or out there , I wo n't submit to it . 
I shall kill someone , and shall be shot for it . 
And this will be going on for twenty years !
