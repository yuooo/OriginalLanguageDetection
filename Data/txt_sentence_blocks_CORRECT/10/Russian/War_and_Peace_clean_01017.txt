But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification , not everyone can hope to attain it quickly . 
Hence we have a secondary aim , that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts , to purify and enlighten their minds , by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery , and thereby to render them capable of receiving it . 
`` By purifying and regenerating our members we try , thirdly , to improve the whole human race , offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue , and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world . 
Think this over and I will come to you again . '' 
`` To combat the evil which sways the world ... '' Pierre repeated , and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind . 
He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago , and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them . 
He imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed , imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue . 
Of the three objects mentioned by the Rhetor , this last , that of improving mankind , especially appealed to Pierre . 
The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor , though it aroused his curiosity , did not seem to him essential , and the second aim , that of purifying and regenerating himself , did not much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all that was good . 
Half an hour later , the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues , corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon 's temple , which every Freemason should cultivate in himself .
