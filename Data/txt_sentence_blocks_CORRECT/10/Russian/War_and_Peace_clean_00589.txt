`` And how has it all happened ? 
How quickly ! 
Now I know that not because of her alone , nor of myself alone , but because of everyone , it must inevitably come about . 
They are all expecting it , they are so sure that it will happen that I can not , I can not , disappoint them . 
But how will it be ? 
I do not know , but it will certainly happen ! '' 
thought Pierre , glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes . 
Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what . 
He felt it awkward to attract everyone 's attention and to be considered a lucky man and , with his plain face , to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen .
