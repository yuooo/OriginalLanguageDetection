He listened with quiet irony to Bitski 's enthusiastic account of it . 
A very simple thought occurred to him : `` What does it matter to me or to Bitski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council ? 
Can all that make me any happier or better ? '' 
And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms . 
He was going to dine that evening at Speranski 's , `` with only a few friends , '' as the host had said when inviting him . 
The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew , especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his domestic surroundings , but now he felt disinclined to go to it . 
At the appointed hour , however , he entered the modest house Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens . 
In the parqueted dining room this small house , remarkable for its extreme cleanliness -LRB- suggesting that of a monastery -RRB- , Prince Andrew , who was rather late , found the friendly gathering of Speranski 's intimate acquaintances already assembled at five o'clock . 
There were no ladies present except Speranski 's little daughter -LRB- long-faced like her father -RRB- and her governess . 
The other guests were Gervais , Magnitski , and Stolypin .
