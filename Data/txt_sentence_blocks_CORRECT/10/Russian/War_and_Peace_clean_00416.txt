`` True enough , '' answered Nesvitski ; `` two smart fellows could have done the job just as well . '' 
`` Ah , your excellency , '' put in Zherkov , his eyes fixed on the hussars , but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest . 
`` Ah , your excellency ! 
How you look at things ! 
Send two men ? 
And who then would give us the Vladimir medal and ribbon ? 
But now , even if they do get peppered , the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon . 
Our Bogdanich knows how things are done . '' 
`` There now ! ''
