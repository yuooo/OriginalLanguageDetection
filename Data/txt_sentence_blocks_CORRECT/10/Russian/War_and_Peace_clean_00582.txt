and again he told himself that it was impossible , that there would be something unnatural , and as it seemed to him dishonorable , in this marriage . 
He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together . 
He recalled Anna Pavlovna 's words and looks when she spoke to him about his house , recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasili and others , and was seized by terror lest he had already , in some way , bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do .

In November , 1805 , Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces . 
He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed , and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man . 
But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs , Prince Vasili had to settle matters with Pierre , who , it is true , had latterly spent whole days at home , that is , in Prince Vasili 's house where he was staying , and had been absurd , excited , and foolish in Helene 's presence -LRB- as a lover should be -RRB- , but had not yet proposed to her . 
`` This is all very fine , but things must be settled , '' said Prince Vasili to himself , with a sorrowful sigh , one morning , feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him -LRB- `` But never mind that '' -RRB- was not behaving very well in this matter . 
`` Youth , frivolity ... well , God be with him , '' thought he , relishing his own goodness of heart , `` but it must be brought to a head . 
The day after tomorrow will be Lelya 's name day .
