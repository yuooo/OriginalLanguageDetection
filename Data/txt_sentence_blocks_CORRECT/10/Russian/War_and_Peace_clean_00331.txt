The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkov spoke , and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov 's reply . 
`` And how do you get on with the officers ? '' 
inquired Zherkov . 
`` All right . 
They are good fellows . 
And how have you wriggled onto the staff ? '' 
`` I was attached ; I 'm on duty . '' 
Both were silent . 
`` She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve , '' went the song , arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness . 
Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song .
