This path led to the barn . 
The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof , that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone , sparkled in the moonlight . 
A tree in the garden snapped with the frost , and then all was again perfectly silent . 
His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness . 
From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps , the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying , `` Straight , straight , along the path , Miss. . 
Only , do n't look back . '' 
`` I am not afraid , '' answered Sonya 's voice , and along the path toward Nicholas came the crunching , whistling sound of Sonya 's feet in her thin shoes . 
Sonya came along , wrapped in her cloak . 
She was only a couple of paces away when she saw him , and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had known and always slightly feared . 
He was in a woman 's dress , with tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya .
