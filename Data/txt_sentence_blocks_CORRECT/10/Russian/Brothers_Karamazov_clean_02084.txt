I know you . 
Then I shall have attained my object , which is an honourable one . 
I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak-tree - and such an oak-tree that , sitting on it , you will long to enter the ranks of ` the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women , ' for that is what you are secretly longing for . 
You 'll dine on locusts , you 'll wander into the wilderness to save your soul ! '' 
`` Then it 's for the salvation of my soul you are working , is it , you scoundrel ? '' 
`` One must do a good work sometimes . 
How ill-humoured you are ! '' 
`` Fool ! 
did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss ? '' 
`` My dear fellow , I 've done nothing else .
