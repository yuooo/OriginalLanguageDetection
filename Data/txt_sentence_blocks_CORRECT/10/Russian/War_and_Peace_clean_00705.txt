It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues . 
That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part . 
At that council , contrary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and Prince Schwartzenberg , it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte . 
The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace to find Dolgorukov . 
Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day 's council , at which the party of the young had triumphed . 
The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council -- the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it -- no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past . 
All the advantages were on our side . 
Our enormous forces , undoubtedly superior to Napoleon 's , were concentrated in one place , the troops inspired by the Emperors ' presence were eager for action . 
The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother : a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to be fought ; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps , and Bonaparte , evidently weakened , was undertaking nothing . 
Dolgorukov , one of the warmest advocates of an attack , had just returned from the council , tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained .
