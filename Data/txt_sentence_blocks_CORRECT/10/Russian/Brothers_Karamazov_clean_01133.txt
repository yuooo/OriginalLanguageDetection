It was dreadfully late when he waked . 
It was somewhere about nine o'clock . 
The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut . 
The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on . 
He had another samovar and another bottle in front of him . 
Yesterday 's bottle had already been finished , and the new one was more than half empty . 
Mitya jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again , hopelessly and incurably . 
He stared at him for a moment with wide opened eyes . 
The peasant was silently and slyly watching him , with insulting composure , and even a sort of contemptuous condescension , so Mitya fancied . 
He rushed up to him .
