He jumped up at the sound of her light step . 
`` Nataly , '' he said , moving with rapid steps toward her , `` decide my fate . 
It is in your hands . '' 
`` Vasili Dmitrich , I 'm so sorry for you ! 
... No , but you are so nice ... but it wo n't do ... not that ... but as a friend , I shall always love you . '' 
Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not understand .

At this instant , they heard the quick rustle of the countess ' dress .
