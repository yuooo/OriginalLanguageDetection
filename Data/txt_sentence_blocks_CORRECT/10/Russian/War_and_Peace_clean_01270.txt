In spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the Rostovs , but with less flurry -- for to her it was a matter of routine . 
Her ugly old body was washed , perfumed , and powdered in just the same way . 
She had washed behind her ears just as carefully , and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress , wearing her badge as maid of honor , her old lady 's maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs ' servants had been . 
She praised the Rostovs ' toilets . 
They praised her taste and toilet , and at eleven o'clock , careful of their coiffures and dresses , they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off . 
Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her . 
In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage , she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball , in those brightly lighted rooms -- with music , flowers , dances , the Emperor , and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg . 
The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true , so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage . 
She understood all that awaited her only when , after stepping over the red baize at the entrance , she entered the hall , took off her fur cloak , and , beside Sonya and in front of her mother , mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers . 
Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball , and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion .
