Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna 's beauty when , three weeks before , Dmitri had first brought him , at Katerina Ivanovna 's special request , to be introduced to her . 
There had been no conversation between them at that interview , however . 
Supposing Alyosha to be very shy , Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him . 
Alyosha had been silent , but he had seen a great deal very clearly . 
He was struck by the imperiousness , proud ease , and self-confidence of the haughty girl . 
And all that was certain , Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it . 
He thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine , especially with her pale , even rather sallow , longish face . 
But in those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might well be passionately in love , but which perhaps could not be loved for long . 
He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when , after the visit , his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed . 
`` You 'll be happy with her , but perhaps not tranquilly happy . ''
