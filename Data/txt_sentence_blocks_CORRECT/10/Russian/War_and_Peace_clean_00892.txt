And so it turns out . '' 
He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection . 
Particularly vivid , humiliating , and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there , who , bowing respectfully , looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly , as if expressing respectful understanding of his employer 's happiness . 
`` But how often I have felt proud of her , proud of her majestic beauty and social tact , '' thought he ; `` been proud of my house , in which she received all Petersburg , proud of her unapproachability and beauty . 
So this is what I was proud of ! 
I then thought that I did not understand her . 
How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her , for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires , and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman . 
Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear .
