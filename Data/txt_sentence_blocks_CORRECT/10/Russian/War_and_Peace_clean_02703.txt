When Grekov returned , Count Orlov-Denisov , excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear , as well as by the proximity of the enemy , resolved to advance . 
All his men felt the same excitement . 
`` Mount ! '' 
he commanded in a whisper . 
The men took their places and crossed themselves ... `` Forward , with God 's aid ! '' 
`` Hurrah-ah-ah ! '' 
reverberated in the forest , and the Cossack companies , trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack , dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp . 
One desperate , frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the Cossacks , and all who were in the camp , undressed and only just waking up , ran off in all directions , abandoning cannons , muskets , and horses . 
Had the Cossacks pursued the French , without heeding what was behind and around them , they would have captured Murat and everything there . 
That was what the officers desired .
