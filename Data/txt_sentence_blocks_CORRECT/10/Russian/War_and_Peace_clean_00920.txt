`` You did not get my letter ? '' 
he asked , and not waiting for a reply -- which he would not have received , for the princess was unable to speak -- he turned back , rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him -LRB- they had met at the last post station -RRB- , and again embraced his sister . 
`` What a strange fate , Masha darling ! '' 
And having taken off his cloak and felt boots , he went to the little princess ' apartment . 
The little princess lay supported by pillows , with a white cap on her head -LRB- the pains had just left her -RRB- . 
Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks , her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully . 
Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying . 
Her glittering eyes , filled with childlike fear and excitement , rested on him without changing their expression . 
`` I love you all and have done no harm to anyone ; why must I suffer so ? 
Help me ! ''
