That he did not finish his studies is true , but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice . 
I 'll simply repeat what I have said above . 
He entered upon this path only because , at that time , it alone struck his imagination and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul from darkness to light . 
Add to that that he was to some extent a youth of our last epoch - that is , honest in nature , desiring the truth , seeking for it and believing in it , and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength of his soul , seeking for immediate action , and ready to sacrifice everything , life itself , for it . 
Though these young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is , in many cases , the easiest of all sacrifices , and that to sacrifice , for instance , five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious study , if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set before them as their goal such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength of many of them . 
The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction , but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement . 
As soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and immortality , and at once he instinctively said to himself : `` I want to live for immortality , and I will accept no compromise . '' 
In the same way , if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist , he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist . 
For socialism is not merely the labour question , it is before all things the atheistic question , the question of the form taken by atheism to-day , the question of the tower of Babel built without God , not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth . 
Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before .
