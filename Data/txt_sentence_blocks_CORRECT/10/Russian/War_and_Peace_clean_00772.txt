`` Plenty of time , your excellency , '' muttered Kutuzov in the midst of a yawn . 
`` Plenty of time , '' he repeated . 
Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting , and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns .
