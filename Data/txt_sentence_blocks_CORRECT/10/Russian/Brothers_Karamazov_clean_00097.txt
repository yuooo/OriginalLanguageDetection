said Father Zossima , looking curiously at her . 
`` Townfolk we are , Father , townfolk . 
Yet we are peasants though we live in the town . 
I have come to see you , O Father ! 
We heard of you , Father , we heard of you . 
I have buried my little son , and I have come on a pilgrimage . 
I have been in three monasteries , but they told me , ` Go , Nastasya , go to them ' - that is to you . 
I have come ; I was yesterday at the service , and to-day I have come to you . '' 
`` What are you weeping for ? '' 
`` It 's my little son I 'm grieving for , Father .
