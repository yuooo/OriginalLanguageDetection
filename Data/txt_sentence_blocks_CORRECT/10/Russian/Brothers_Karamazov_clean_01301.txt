Come , tell us your story , '' Grushenka cried to Maximov . 
`` Why are you all silent ? '' 
`` There 's nothing to tell , it 's all so foolish , '' answered Maximov at once , with evident satisfaction , mincing a little . 
`` Besides , all that 's by way of allegory in Gogol , for he 's made all the names have a meaning .

Fenardi really was called Fenardi , only he was n't an Italian but a Russian , and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights , and she had a little short skirt with spangles , and she kept turning round and round , only not for four hours but for four minutes only , and she bewitched everyone ... '' `` But what were you beaten for ? '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` For Piron ! '' 
answered Maximov . 
`` What Piron ? ''
