`` The landlord 's grain is all safe , '' replied Dron proudly . 
`` Our prince did not order it to be sold . '' 
`` Give it to the peasants , let them have all they need ; I give you leave in my brother 's name , '' said she . 
Dron made no answer but sighed deeply . 
`` Give them that corn if there is enough of it . 
Distribute it all . 
I give this order in my brother 's name ; and tell them that what is ours is theirs . 
We do not grudge them anything . 
Tell them so . '' 
Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking .
