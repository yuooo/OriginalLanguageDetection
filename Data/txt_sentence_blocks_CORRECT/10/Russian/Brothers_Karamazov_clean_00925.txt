One day , quite unexpectedly indeed , after he had been talking with great fervour a long time , I saw him suddenly turn pale , and his face worked convulsively , while he stared persistently at me . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
I said ; `` do you feel ill ? '' 
- he had just been complaining of headache . 
`` I. . . 
do you know ... I murdered someone . '' 
He said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk . 
`` Why is it he is smiling ? '' 
The thought flashed through my mind before I realised anything else . 
I too turned pale .
