cried Mitya , from his seat , `` just so ! '' 
Mitya , of course , was checked , but the young doctor 's opinion had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public , and , as appeared afterwards , everyone agreed with him . 
But Doctor Herzenstube , when called as a witness , was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya . 
As an old resident in the town , who had known the Karamazov family for years , he furnished some facts of great value for the prosecution , and suddenly , as though recalling something , he added : `` But the poor young man might have had a very different life , for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood , that I know . 
But the Russian proverb says , ` If a man has one head , it 's good , but if another clever man comes to visit him , it would be better still , for then there will be two heads and not only one . '' ' 
`` One head is good , but two are better , '' the prosecutor put in impatiently . 
He knew the old man 's habit of talking slowly and deliberately , regardless of the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing , and highly prizing his flat , dull and always gleefully complacent German wit . 
The old man was fond of making jokes . 
`` Oh , yes , that 's what I say , '' he went on stubbornly . 
`` One head is good , but two are much better , but he did not meet another head with wits , and his wits went .
