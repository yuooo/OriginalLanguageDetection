that interested him . 
What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care , but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular , memorandum , or report , skillfully , pointedly , and elegantly . 
Bilibin 's services were valued not only for what he wrote , but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres . 
Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work , only when it could be made elegantly witty . 
In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible . 
His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original , finished phrases of general interest . 
These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally , so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room . 
And , in fact , Bilibin 's witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important . 
His thin , worn , sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles , which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one 's fingers after a Russian bath .
