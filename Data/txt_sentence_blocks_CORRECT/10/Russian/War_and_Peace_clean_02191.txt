they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off . 
`` There , lads ... oh , oh ! '' 
they mimicked the peasants , `` they do n't like it at all ! '' 
Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt , and after every loss , the liveliness increased more and more . 
As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud , so , as if in opposition to what was taking place , the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men . 
Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there ; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul . 
At ten o'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated . 
From the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets . 
A general with his suite came to the battery , and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down , so as to be less exposed to fire . 
After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command , and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward .
