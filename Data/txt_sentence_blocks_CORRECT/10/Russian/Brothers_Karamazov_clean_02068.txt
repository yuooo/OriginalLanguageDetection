If anything is wrong with your nose , they send you to Paris : there , they say , is a European specialist who cures noses . 
If you go to Paris , he 'll look at your nose ; I can only cure your right nostril , he 'll tell you , for I do n't cure the left nostril , that 's not my speciality , but go to Vienna , there there 's a specialist who will cure your left nostril . 
What are you to do ? 
I fell back on popular remedies , a German doctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the bath-house . 
Solely to get an extra bath I went , smeared myself all over and it did me no good at all . 
In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan . 
He sent me a book and some drops , bless him , and , only fancy , Hoff 's malt extract cured me ! 
I bought it by accident , drank a bottle and a half of it , and I was ready to dance , it took it away completely . 
I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him , I was prompted by a feeling of gratitude , and only fancy , it led to no end of a bother : not a single paper would take my letter . 
` It would be very reactionary , ' they said , ` none will believe it .
