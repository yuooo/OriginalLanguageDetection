I 've got it at home in the town , '' faltered Mitya , his spirit sinking at every word he uttered . 
`` Upon my word , the money 's there , hidden . '' 
In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man 's face . 
`` What next ? '' 
he asked ironically . 
`` For shame ! '' 
and he spat on the floor . 
Pan Vrublevsky spat too . 
`` You do that , panie , '' said Mitya , recognising with despair that all was over , `` because you hope to make more out of Grushenka ? 
You 're a couple of capons , that 's what you are ! ''
