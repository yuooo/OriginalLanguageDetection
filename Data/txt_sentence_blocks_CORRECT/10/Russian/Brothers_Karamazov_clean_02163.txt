`` As to the opinion of my learned colleague , '' the Moscow doctor added ironically in conclusion `` that the prisoner would , entering the court , have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him , I will only say that , apart from the playfulness of this theory , it is radically unsound . 
For though I fully agree that the prisoner , on entering the court where his fate will be decided , would not naturally look straight before him in that fixed way , and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition , at the same time I maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies , but , on the contrary , to the right to find his legal adviser , on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defence all his future depends . '' 
The doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically . 
But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts . 
In his opinion the prisoner was now , and had been all along , in a perfectly normal condition , and , although he certainly must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before his arrest , this might have been due to several perfectly obvious causes , jealousy , anger , continual drunkenness , and so on . 
But this nervous condition would not involve the mental abberation of which mention had just been made . 
As to the question whether the prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the court , `` in his modest opinion , '' the prisoner would naturally look straight before him on entering the court , as he had in fact done , as that was where the judges , on whom his fate depended , were sitting . 
So that it was just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectly normal state of mind at the present . 
The young doctor concluded his `` modest '' testimony with some heat . 
`` Bravo , doctor ! ''
