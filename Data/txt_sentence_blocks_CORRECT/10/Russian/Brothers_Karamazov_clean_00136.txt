What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself . 
Avoid fear , too , though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood . 
Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness in attaining love . 
Do n't be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions . 
I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you , for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams . 
Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action , rapidly performed and in the sight of all . 
Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over , with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage . 
But active love is labour and fortitude , and for some people too , perhaps , a complete science . 
But I predict that just when you see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther from your goal instead of nearer to it - at that very moment I predict that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you . 
Forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you .
