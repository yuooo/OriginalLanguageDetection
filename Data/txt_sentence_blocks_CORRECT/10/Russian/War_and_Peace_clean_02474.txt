His face grew red and was covered with perspiration . 
Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure . 
Morel , the orderly , brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it . 
He also brought a bottle of kvass , taken from the kitchen for them to try . 
That beverage was already known to the French and had been given a special name . 
They called it limonade de cochon -LRB- pig 's lemonade -RRB- , and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen . 
But as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through Moscow , he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux . 
He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre . 
The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner .
