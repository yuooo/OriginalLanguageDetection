`` Yes , '' replied the countess . 
She held out her hand to him , and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand . 
She wished to love him as a son , but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man . 
`` I am sure my husband will consent , '' said the countess , `` but your father ... '' `` My father , to whom I have told my plans , has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year . 
And I wished to tell you of that , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` It is true that Natasha is still young , but -- so long as that ? 
... '' `` It is unavoidable , '' said Prince Andrew with a sigh . 
`` I will send her to you , '' said the countess , and left the room . 
`` Lord have mercy upon us ! '' 
she repeated while seeking her daughter .
