No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history ; but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie , and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings , commanders , and ministers and propounding the historians ' own reflections concerning these actions . 
The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia . 
The Russian army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached , and again from Smolensk to Borodino . 
The French army pushed on to Moscow , its goal , its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim , just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth . 
Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken , hostile country ; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal . 
Every soldier in Napoleon 's army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum . 
The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up , and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated . 
At Borodino a collision took place . 
Neither army was broken up , but the Russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum , and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance , though the collision had deprived it of all its force . 
The Russians retreated eighty miles -- to beyond Moscow -- and the French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill .
