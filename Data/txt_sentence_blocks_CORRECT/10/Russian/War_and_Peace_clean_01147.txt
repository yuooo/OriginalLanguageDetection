You know the auditor told you it was a bad business . '' 
`` Well , let it be bad , '' said Denisov . 
`` The auditor wrote out a petition for you , '' continued Tushin , `` and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it . 
No doubt he '' -LRB- indicating Rostov -RRB- `` has connections on the staff . 
You wo n't find a better opportunity . '' 
`` Have n't I said I 'm not going to gwovel ? '' 
Denisov interrupted him , went on reading his paper . 
Rostov had not the courage to persuade Denisov , though he instinctively felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other officers was the safest , and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denisov . 
He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper . 
When the reading of Denisov 's virulent reply , which took more than an hour , was over , Rostov said nothing , and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov 's hospital comrades , who had round him , telling them what he knew and listening to their stories .
