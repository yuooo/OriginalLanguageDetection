`` Thank God ! '' 
said the voice . 
`` And Father ? '' 
`` Gone to bed , '' replied the voice of Demyan the house steward , who was downstairs . 
Then the voice said something more , Demyan replied , and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly . 
`` It 's Andrew ! '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
`` No it ca n't be , that would be too extraordinary , '' and at the very moment she thought this , the face and figure of Prince Andrew , in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow , appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the candle . 
Yes , it was he , pale , thin , with a changed and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face . 
He came up the stairs and embraced his sister .
