`` That was the day before yesterday , in the evening , but last night everything was changed . 
He had gone to school in the morning , he came back depressed , terribly depressed . 
In the evening I took him by the hand and we went for a walk ; he would not talk . 
There was a wind blowing and no sun , and a feeling of autumn ; twilight was coming on . 
We walked along , both of us depressed . 
` Well , my boy , ' said I , ` how about our setting off on our travels ? ' 
I thought I might bring him back to our talk of the day before . 
He did n't answer , but I felt his fingers trembling in my hand . 
Ah , I thought , it 's a bad job ; there 's something fresh . 
We had reached the stone where we are now .
