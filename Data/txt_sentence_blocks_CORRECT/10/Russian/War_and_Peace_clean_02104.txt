Following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments -- one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers . 
Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large , dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover . 
This was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied the army . 
Behind , before , and on both sides , crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked , ran , and bowed to the ground . 
At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon ; the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others , the chanters relit their censers , and service began . 
The hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon . 
The singing did not sound loud under the open sky . 
An immense crowd of bareheaded officers , soldiers , and militiamen surrounded the icon . 
Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them . 
A bald general with general with a St. George 's Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest 's back , and without crossing himself -LRB- he was evidently a German -RRB- patiently awaited the end of the service , which he considered it necessary to hear to the end , probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people .
