In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness . 
Natasha , leaning on her elbow , the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative , watched Pierre with an attention that never wandered -- evidently herself experiencing all that he described . 
Not only her look , but her exclamations and the brief questions she put , showed Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey . 
It was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to , but could not , express in words . 
The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this : `` It was an awful sight -- children abandoned , some in the flames ... One was snatched out before my eyes ... and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out ... '' he flushed and grew confused . 
`` Then a patrol arrived and all the men -- all those who were not looting , that is -- were arrested , and I among them . '' 
`` I am sure you 're not telling us everything ; I am sure you did something ... '' said Natasha and pausing added , `` something fine ? '' 
Pierre continued . 
When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details , but Natasha insisted that he should not omit anything . 
Pierre began to tell about Karataev , but paused .
