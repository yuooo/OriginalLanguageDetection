The French , the spy reported , having crossed the Vienna bridge , were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim , which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of Kutuzov 's retreat . 
If he reached Znaim before the French , there would be great hope of saving the army ; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm , or to utter destruction . 
But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible . 
The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim . 
The night he received the news , Kutuzov sent Bagration 's vanguard , four thousand strong , to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road . 
Bagration was to make this march without resting , and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear , and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible . 
Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim . 
Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills , with his hungry , ill-shod soldiers , and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way , Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from Vienna . 
Kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim . 
Hence Bagration with his four thousand hungry , exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn , which was clearly impossible .
