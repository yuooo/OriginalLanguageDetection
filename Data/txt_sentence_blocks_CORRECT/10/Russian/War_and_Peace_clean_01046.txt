The old man , roused by activity , expected the best results from the new campaign , while Prince Andrew on the contrary , taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this , saw only the dark side . 
On February 26 , 1807 , the old prince set off on one of his circuits . 
Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father 's absence . 
Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days . 
The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew . 
Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to Princess Mary 's apartments , but did not find him there . 
He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery . 
`` If you please , your excellency , Petrusha has brought some papers , '' said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child 's little chair while , frowning and with trembling hands , he poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water . 
`` What is it ? '' 
he said crossly , and , his hand shaking unintentionally , he poured too many drops into the glass .
