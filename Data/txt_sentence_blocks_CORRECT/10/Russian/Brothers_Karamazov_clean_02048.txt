At last his eyes were fastened intently on one point . 
Ivan smiled , but an angry flush suffused his face . 
He sat a long time in his place , his head propped on both arms , though he looked sideways at the same point , at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall . 
There was evidently something , some object , that irritated him there , worried him and tormented him .

Ivan 's Nightmare I AM NOT a doctor , but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan 's illness . 
Anticipating events I can say at least one thing : he was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever . 
Though his health had long been affected , it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it . 
Though I know nothing of medicine , I venture to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps , by a terrible effort of will , succeeded in delaying the attack for a time , hoping , of course , to check it completely . 
He knew that he was unwell , but he loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time , at the approaching crisis in his life , when he needed to have all his wits about him , to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and `` to justify himself to himself . ''
