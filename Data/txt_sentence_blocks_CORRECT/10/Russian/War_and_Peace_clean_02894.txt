And she ran out of the room , with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow . 
After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief , Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself , sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa , tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on . 
This solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it . 
As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly , changed her position and expression , and picked up a book or some sewing , evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go . 
She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which -- with a terrible questioning too great for her strength - her spiritual gaze was fixed . 
One day toward the end of December Natasha , pale and thin , dressed in a black woolen gown , her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot , was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa , nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door . 
She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone -- to the other side of life . 
And that other side of life , of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable , was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life , where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity . 
She was gazing where she knew him to be ; but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here . 
She now saw him again as he had been at Mytishchi , at Troitsa , and at Yaroslavl .
