`` It is not true ; there are now two Russians , Miloradovich , and Dokhturov , and there would be a third , Count Arakcheev , if his nerves were not too weak . '' 
`` However , I think General Kutuzov has come out , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` I wish you good luck and success , gentlemen ! '' 
he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin . 
On the way home , Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutuzov , who was sitting silently beside him , what he thought of tomorrow 's battle . 
Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and , after a pause , replied : `` I think the battle will be lost , and so I told Count Tolstoy and asked him to tell the Emperor . 
What do you think he replied ? 
` But , my dear general , I am engaged with rice and cutlets , look after military matters yourself ! ' 
Yes ... That was the answer I got ! '' 
Shortly after nine o'clock that evening , Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutuzov 's quarters where the council of war was to be held .
