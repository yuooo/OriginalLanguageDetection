On the other hand , Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother 's lodging in Lake Street , without a letter , but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here , in the marketplace . 
I went , but did n't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home , though it was eight o'clock . 
` He 's been here , but he is quite gone , ' those were the very words of his landlady . 
It 's as though there was an understanding between them . 
Perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch , for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago , and is gone to lie down . 
But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you , for he 'd kill me for nothing at all . '' 
`` Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day ? '' 
repeated Alyosha quickly . 
`` That 's so . '' 
`` The Metropolis tavern in the marketplace ? ''
