The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner , and Mitya made his appearance . 
There was a hush through the court . 
One could have heard a fly . 
I do n't know how it was with others , but Mitya made a most unfavourable impression on me . 
He looked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat . 
I heard afterwards that he had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his own tailor , who had his measure . 
He wore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen . 
He walked in with his yard-long strides , looking stiffly straight in front of him , and sat down in his place with a most unperturbed air . 
At the same moment the counsel for defence , the celebrated Fetyukovitch , entered , and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court . 
He was a tall , spare man , with long thin legs , with extremely long , thin , pale fingers , clean-shaven face , demurely brushed , rather short hair , and thin lips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile .
