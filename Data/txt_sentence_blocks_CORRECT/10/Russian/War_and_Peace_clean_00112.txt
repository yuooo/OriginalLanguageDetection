But the smile did not enhance Vera 's beauty as smiles generally do ; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural , and therefore unpleasant , expression . 
Vera was good-looking , not at all stupid , quick at learning , was well brought up , and had a pleasant voice ; what she said was true and appropriate , yet , strange to say , everyone - the visitors and countess alike -- turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it , and they all felt awkward . 
`` People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them , '' said the visitor . 
`` What 's the good of denying it , my dear ? 
Our dear countess was too clever with Vera , '' said the count . 
`` Well , what of that ? 
She 's turned out splendidly all the same , '' he added , winking at Vera . 
The guests got up and took their leave , promising to return to dinner . 
`` What manners ! 
I thought they would never go , '' said the countess , when she had seen her guests out .
