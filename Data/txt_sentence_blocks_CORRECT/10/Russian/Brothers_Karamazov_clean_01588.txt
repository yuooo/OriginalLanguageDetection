They procceded to a revision of the protocol . 
Mitya got up , moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain , lay down on a large chest covered with a rug , and instantly fell asleep . 
He had a strange dream , utterly out of keeping with the place and the time . 
He was driving somewhere in the steppes , where he had been stationed long ago , and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses , through snow and sleet . 
He was cold , it was early in November , and the snow was falling in big wet flakes , melting as soon as it touched the earth . 
And the peasant drove him smartly , he had a fair , long beard . 
He was not an old man , somewhere about fifty , and he had on a grey peasant 's smock . 
Not far off was a village , he could see the black huts , and half the huts were burnt down , there were only the charred beams sticking up . 
And as they drove in , there were peasant women drawn up along the road , a lot of women , a whole row , all thin and wan , with their faces a sort of brownish colour , especially one at the edge , a tall , bony woman , who looked forty , but might have been only twenty , with a long thin face . 
And in her arms was a little baby crying .
