The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front . 
There were about thirty officers , with Pierre among them , and about three hundred men . 
The officers , who had come from the other sheds , were all strangers to Pierre and much better dressed than he . 
They looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully , as at an alien . 
Not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow , bloated , angry face , who was wearing a Kazan dressing grown tied round with a towel , and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners . 
He kept one hand , in which he clasped his tobacco pouch , inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other . 
Panting and puffing , the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at . 
Another , a thin little officer , was speaking to everyone , conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day . 
An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow , loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see . 
A third officer , who by his accent was a Pole , disputed with the commissariat officer , arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow .
