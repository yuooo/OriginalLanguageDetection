Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something , but Pierre interrupted her . 
`` Just imagine -- I knew nothing about him ! '' 
said he . 
`` I thought he had been killed . 
All I know I heard at second hand from others . 
I only know that he fell in with the Rostovs ... . 
What a strange coincidence ! '' 
Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation . 
He glanced once at the companion 's face , saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him , and , as often happens when one is talking , felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good , kind , excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary .
