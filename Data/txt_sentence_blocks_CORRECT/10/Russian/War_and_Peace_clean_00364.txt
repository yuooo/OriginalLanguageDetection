It must be here somewhere , '' said Lavrushka . 
`` Now then , you devil 's puppet , look alive and hunt for it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture . 
`` If the purse is n't found I 'll flog you , I 'll flog you all . '' 
Rostov , his eyes avoiding Denisov , began buttoning his coat , buckled on his saber , and put on his cap . 
`` I must have that purse , I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall . 
`` Denisov , let him alone , I know who has taken it , '' said Rostov , going toward the door without raising his eyes . 
Denisov paused , thought a moment , and , evidently understanding what Rostov hinted at , seized his arm . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he cried , and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords .
