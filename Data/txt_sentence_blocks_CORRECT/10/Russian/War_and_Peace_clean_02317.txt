But of late Sonya had been particularly sad and silent . 
Nicholas ' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited , in her presence , joyous comments from the countess , who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas . 
`` I was never pleased at Bolkonski 's engagement to Natasha , '' said the countess , `` but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess , and had a presentiment that it would happen . 
What a good thing it would be ! '' 
Sonya felt that this was true : that the only possibility of retrieving the Rostovs ' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman , and that the princess was a good match .
