`` What is it ? '' 
`` Why , Fenya threw herself at your feet just now , and begged you not to harm her mistress , and someone else , too ... so you see , sir - It 's I am taking you there ... forgive me , sir , it 's my conscience ... maybe it 's stupid of me to speak of it - . '' 
Mitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind . 
`` Are you a driver ? '' 
he asked frantically . 
`` Yes sir . '' 
`` Then you know that one has to make way .

No , a driver must n't run over people .
