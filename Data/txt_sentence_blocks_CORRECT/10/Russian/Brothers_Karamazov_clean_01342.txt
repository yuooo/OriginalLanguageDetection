Mitya himself was almost delirious , feeling that his happiness was at hand . 
But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her . 
`` Go and enjoy yourself . 
Tell them to dance , to make merry , ` let the stove and cottage dance ' ; as we had it last time , '' she kept exclaiming . 
She was tremendously excited . 
And Mitya hastened to obey her . 
The chorus were in the next room . 
The room in which they had been sitting till that moment was too small , and was divided in two by cotton curtains , behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows . 
In the four rooms for visitors there were beds . 
Grushenka settled herself just at the door .
