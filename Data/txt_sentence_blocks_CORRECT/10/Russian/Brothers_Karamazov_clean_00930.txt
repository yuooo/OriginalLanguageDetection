He was miserable a long time , but not for that reason ; only from regret that he had killed the woman he loved , that she was no more , that in killing her he had killed his love , while the fire of passion was still in his veins . 
But of the innocent blood he had shed , of the murder of a fellow creature , he scarcely thought . 
The thought that his victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable to him , and so , for a long time , he was convinced in his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise . 
At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant , but his illness and death soon set his mind at rest , for the man 's death was apparently -LRB- so he reflected at the time -RRB- not owing to his arrest or his fright , but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away , when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground . 
The theft of the money and other things troubled him little , for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion . 
The sum stolen was small , and he shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it , and much more , towards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town . 
He did this on purpose to set his conscience at rest about the theft , and it 's a remarkable fact that for a long time he really was at peace - he told me this himself . 
He entered then upon a career of great activity in the service , volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty , which occupied him two years , and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past . 
Whenever he recalled it , he tried not to think of it at all . 
He became active in philanthropy too , founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town , did a good deal in the two capitals , and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies .
