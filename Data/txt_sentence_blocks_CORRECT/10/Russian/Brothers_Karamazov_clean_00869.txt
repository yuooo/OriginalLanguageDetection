In the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch ; he was informed that Grigory , who had not been well for the last three days , was completely laid up by his lumbago . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house . 
He was in terrible excitement and suspense . 
That evening he reckoned on Grushenka 's coming almost as a certainty . 
He had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance `` that she had promised to come without fail . '' 
The incorrigible old man 's heart throbbed with excitement ; he paced up and down his empty rooms listening . 
He had to be on the alert . 
Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere , and when she knocked on the window -LRB- Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock -RRB- the door must be opened at once . 
She must not be a second in the passage , for fear which God forbid ! 
- that she should be frightened and run away .
