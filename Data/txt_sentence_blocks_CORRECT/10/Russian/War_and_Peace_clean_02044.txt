Come along ... '' said he , glancing wearily round , and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight . 
He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch . 
`` And how 's your father ? '' 
`` I received news of his death , yesterday , '' replied Prince Andrew abruptly . 
Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself : `` May the kingdom of Heaven be his ! 
God 's will be done to us all ! '' 
He sighed deeply , his whole chest heaving , and was silent for a while . 
`` I loved him and respected him , and sympathize with you with all my heart . '' 
He embraced Prince Andrew , pressing him to his fat breast , and for some time did not let him go .
