He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov 's , that it was to his , Ivan 's , advantage that his brother should be convicted , as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha 's from forty to sixty thousand roubles . 
He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya 's escape . 
On his return from seeing him , he was very mournful and dispirited ; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya 's escape , not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand , but for another reason . 
`` Is it because I am as much a murderer at heart ? '' 
he asked himself . 
Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul . 
His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month . 
But of that later ... . 
When , after his conversation with Alyosha , Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov , he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation . 
He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha 's presence : `` It was you , you , persuaded me of his '' -LRB- that is , Mitya 's -RRB- `` guilt ! ''
