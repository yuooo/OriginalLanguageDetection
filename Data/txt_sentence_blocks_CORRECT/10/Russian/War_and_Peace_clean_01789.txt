Bagration was the best , Napoleon himself admitted that . 
And of Bonaparte himself ! 
I remember his limited , self-satisfied face on the field of Austerlitz . 
Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities , on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes -- love , poetry , tenderness , and philosophic inquiring doubt . 
He should be limited , firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important -LRB- otherwise he will not have sufficient patience -RRB- , and only then will he be a brave leader . 
God forbid that he should be humane , should love , or pity , or think of what is just and unjust . 
It is understandable that a theory of their ` genius ' was invented for them long ago because they have power ! 
The success of a military action depends not on them , but on the man in the ranks who shouts , ` We are lost ! ' 
or who shouts , ` Hurrah ! ' 
And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful . ''
