thought Rostov . 
At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory . 
The Emperor was pale , his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow , but the charm , the mildness of his features , was all the greater . 
Rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false . 
He was happy to be seeing him . 
He knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver . 
But as a youth in love trembles , is unnerved , and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights , but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with her , so Rostov , now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world , did not know how to approach the Emperor , and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient , unseemly , and impossible to do so . 
`` What ! 
It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent ! 
A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow ; besides , what can I say to him now , when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him ? ''
