What was your motive for making such a secret of it ? 
To be more precise : You have told us at last your secret , in your words , so ` disgraceful , ' though in reality - that is , of course , comparatively speaking - this action , that is , the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to someone else , and , of course , only for a time is , in my view at least , only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful , when one takes into consideration your character ... . 
Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable , still , discreditable is not ` disgraceful . ' 
... Many people have already guessed , during this last month , about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna 's that you have spent , and I heard the legend myself , apart from your confession ... . 
Mihail Makarovitch , for instance , had heard it , too , so that indeed , it was scarcely a legend , but the gossip of the whole town . 
There are indications , too , if I am not mistaken , that you confessed this yourself to someone , I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna 's , and so , it 's extremely surprising to me that hitherto , that is , up to the present moment , you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by , apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret ... . 
It 's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret ... . 
You cried out , just now , that Siberia would be better than confessing it ... '' The prosecutor ceased speaking . 
He was provoked . 
He did not conceal his vexation , which was almost anger , and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen , disconnectedly and incoherently , without choosing words .
