Hush , hush , Alexey Fyodorovitch , for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing . 
This awful trial ... I shall certainly go , I am making arrangements . 
I shall be carried there in my chair ; besides I can sit up . 
I shall have people with me . 
And , you know , I am a witness . 
How shall I speak , how shall I speak ? 
I do n't know what I shall say . 
One has to take an oath , has n't one ? '' 
`` Yes ; but I do n't think you will be able to go . '' 
`` I can sit up .
