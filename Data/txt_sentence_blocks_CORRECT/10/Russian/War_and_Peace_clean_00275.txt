You may laugh as much as you like , but all the same Bonaparte is a great general ! '' 
`` Michael Ivanovich ! '' 
cried the old prince to the architect who , busy with his roast meat , hoped he had been forgotten : `` Did n't I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician ? 
Here , he says the same thing . '' 
`` To be sure , your excellency . '' 
replied the architect . 
The prince again laughed his frigid laugh . 
`` Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth . 
He has got splendid soldiers . 
Besides he began by attacking Germans .
