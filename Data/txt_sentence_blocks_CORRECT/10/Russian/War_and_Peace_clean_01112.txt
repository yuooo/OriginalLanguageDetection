`` The marshal , a Count Rostov , has n't sent half his contingent . 
He came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner -- I gave him a pretty dinner ! 
... And there , look at this ... . 
Well , my boy , '' the old prince went on , addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder . 
`` A fine fellow -- your friend -- I like him ! 
He stirs me up . 
Another says clever things and one does n't care to listen , but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up . 
Well , go ! 
Get along ! 
Perhaps I 'll come and sit with you at supper .
