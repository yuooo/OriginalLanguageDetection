`` There are not many left of us old friends ! 
That 's why I so value your friendship . '' 
Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused . 
The countess pressed her friend 's hand . 
`` Vera , '' she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite , `` how is it you have so little tact ? 
Do n't you see you are not wanted here ? 
Go to the other girls , or ... '' The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt . 
`` If you had told me sooner , Mamma , I would have gone , '' she replied as she rose to go to her own room . 
But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting , one pair at each window . 
She stopped and smiled scornfully .
