Julie Karagina turned to young Rostov . 
`` What a pity you were n't at the Arkharovs ' on Thursday . 
It was so dull without you , '' said she , giving him a tender smile . 
The young man , flattered , sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile , and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sonya , who blushed and smiled unnaturally . 
In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her . 
She gave him a passionately angry glance , and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips , she got up and left the room . 
All Nicholas ' animation vanished . 
He waited for the first pause in the conversation , and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sonya . 
`` How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves ! '' 
said Anna Mikhaylovna , pointing to Nicholas as he went out .
