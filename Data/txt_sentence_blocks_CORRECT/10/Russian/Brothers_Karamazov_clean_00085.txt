Give me your hand to kiss . '' 
Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up , and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder 's thin hand . 
`` It is , it is pleasant to take offence . 
You said that so well , as I never heard it before . 
Yes , I have been all my life taking offence , to please myself , taking offence on aesthetic grounds , for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted - that you had forgotten , great elder , it is distinguished ! 
I shall make a note of that . 
But I have been lying , lying positively my whole life long , every day and hour of it . 
Of a truth , I am a lie , and the father of lies . 
Though I believe I am not the father of lies . 
I am getting mixed in my texts .
