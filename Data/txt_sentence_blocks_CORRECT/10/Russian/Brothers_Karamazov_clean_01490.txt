he added suddenly , after a pause . 
`` May I ask that question ? '' 
`` You may ask any question , '' the prosecutor replied with frigid severity , `` any question relating to the facts of the case , and we are , I repeat , bound to answer every inquiry you make . 
We found the servant Smerdyakov , concerning whom you inquire , lying unconscious in his bed , in an epileptic fit of extreme severity , that had recurred , possibly , ten times . 
The doctor who was with us told us , after seeing him , that he may possibly not outlive the night . '' 
`` Well , if that 's so , the devil must have killed him , '' broke suddenly from Mitya , as though until that moment had been asking himself : `` Was it Smerdyakov or not ? '' 
`` We will come back to this later , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch decided . 
`` Now would n't you like to continue your statement ? '' 
Mitya asked for a rest . 
His request was courteously granted .
