After a while `` Uncle '' came in , in a Cossack coat , blue trousers , and small top boots . 
And Natasha felt that this costume , the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe , was just the right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat . 
`` Uncle '' too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brother 's and sister 's laughter -LRB- it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life -RRB- he himself joined in the merriment . 
`` That 's right , young countess , that 's it , come on ! 
I never saw anyone like her ! '' 
said he , offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and , with a practiced motion of three fingers , taking down another that had been cut short . 
`` She 's ridden all day like a man , and is as fresh as ever ! '' 
Soon after `` Uncle 's '' reappearance the door was opened , evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl , and a stout , rosy , good-looking woman of about forty , with a double chin and full red lips , entered carrying a large loaded tray . 
With hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion , she looked at the visitors and , with a pleasant smile , bowed respectfully . 
In spite of her exceptional stoutness , which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head , this woman -LRB- who was `` Uncle 's '' housekeeper -RRB- trod very lightly .
