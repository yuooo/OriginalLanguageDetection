shouted Nicholas . 
The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka , sprang impetuously at the wolf , and seized it by its hindquarters , but immediately jumped aside in terror . 
The wolf crouched , gnashed her teeth , and again rose and bounded forward , followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois , who did not get any closer to her . 
`` She 'll get away ! 
No , it 's impossible ! '' 
thought Nicholas , still shouting with a hoarse voice . 
`` Karay , ulyulyu ! 
... '' he shouted , looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope . 
Karay , with all the strength age had left him , stretched himself to the utmost and , watching the wolf , galloped heavily aside to intercept it . 
But the quickness of the wolf 's lope and the borzoi 's slower pace made it plain that Karay had miscalculated .
