The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words , for fear of being laughed at , and yet how true it is ! 
One who does not believe in God will not believe in God 's people . 
He who believes in God 's people will see His Holiness too , even though he had not believed in it till then . 
Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our atheists , who have torn themselves away from their native soil . 
And what is the use of Christ 's words , unless we set an example ? 
The people is lost without the Word of God , for its soul is athirst for the Word and for all that is good . 
In my youth , long ago , nearly forty years ago , I travelled all over Russia with Father Anfim , collecting funds for our monastery , and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen . 
A good looking peasant lad , about eighteen , joined us ; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant 's barge along the bank . 
I noticed him looking straight before him with clear and tender eyes . 
It was a bright , warm , still , July night , a cool mist rose from the broad river , we could hear the plash of a fish , the birds were still , all was hushed and beautiful , everything praying to God .
