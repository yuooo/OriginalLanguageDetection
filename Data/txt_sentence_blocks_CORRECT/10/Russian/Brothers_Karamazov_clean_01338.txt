He held it up and showed it to all in the room . 
`` From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away , and put his in place of it - you 're a cheat and not a gentleman ! '' 
`` And I twice saw the pan change a card ! ''

`` How shameful ! 
How shameful ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , clasping her hands , and blushing for genuine shame . 
`` Good Lord , he 's come to that ! '' 
`` I thought so , too ! ''
