The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny .
