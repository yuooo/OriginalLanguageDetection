From the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house . 
Before that , Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and Sonya , blaming himself and commending her . 
He had asked Princess Mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin . 
She thoroughly realized the wrong he had done Sonya , felt herself to blame toward her , and imagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas ' choice . 
She could not find fault with Sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her , but often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome . 
Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and about her own injustice toward her . 
`` You know , '' said Natasha , `` you have read the Gospels a great deal - there is a passage in them that just fits Sonya . '' 
`` What ? '' 
asked Countess Mary , surprised . '' 
` To him that hath shall be given , and from him that hath not shall be taken away . '
