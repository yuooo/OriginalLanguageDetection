It was a hot July day . 
Even at ten o'clock , when the Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel , the sultry air , the shouts of hawkers , the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd , the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard , the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade , the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones , and the brilliant , hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor , that content and discontent with the present , which is most strongly felt on a bright , hot day in town . 
All the Moscow notabilities , all the Rostovs ' acquaintances , were at the Razumovskis ' chapel , for , as if expecting something to happen , many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer . 
As Natasha , at her mother 's side , passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them , she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper . 
`` That 's Rostova , the one who ... '' `` She 's much thinner , but all the same she 's pretty ! '' 
She heard , or thought she heard , the names of Kuragin and Bolkonski . 
But she was always imagining that . 
It always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her . 
With a sinking heart , wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd , Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked -- as women can walk -- with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul . 
She knew for certain that she was pretty , but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to .
