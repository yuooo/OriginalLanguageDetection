repeated Prince Andrew ironically . 
`` My plans ? '' 
he said , as if astonished at the word . 
`` Well , you see , I 'm building . 
I mean to settle here altogether next year ... '' Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew 's face , which had grown much older . 
`` No , I meant to ask ... '' Pierre began , but Prince Andrew interrupted him . 
`` But why talk of me ? 
... Talk to me , yes , tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates . '' 
Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates , trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made . 
Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre 's story of what he had been doing , as though it were all an old-time story , and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him .
