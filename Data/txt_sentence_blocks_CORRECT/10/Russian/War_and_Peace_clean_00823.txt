Though five minutes before , Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him , now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon , he was silent ... . 
So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon , so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear , compared to the lofty , equitable , and kindly sky which he had seen and understood , that he could not answer him . 
Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood , suffering , and the nearness of death aroused in him . 
Looking into Napoleon 's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness , the unimportance of life which no one could understand , and the still greater unimportance of death , the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain . 
The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went : `` Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac ; let my doctor , Larrey , examine their wounds . 
Au revoir , Prince Repnin ! '' 
and he spurred his horse and galloped away . 
His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure . 
The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother 's neck , but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners , they now hastened to return the holy image . 
Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced , but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform .
