Pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions , but which he had not felt during his imprisonment , now again controlled his existence . 
It was terrible , but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him , there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it . 
He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades . 
Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in Moscow , or of the roughness of their treatment by the French , or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them . 
As if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay . 
They spoke of personal reminiscences , of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign , and avoided all talk of their present situation . 
The sun had set long since . 
Bright stars shone out here and there in the sky . 
A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon , and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze . 
It grew light .
