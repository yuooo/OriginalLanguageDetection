`` Fancy the Emperor 's position ! '' 
said they , and instead of extolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before , they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor 's anxiety . 
That day Prince Vasili no longer boasted of his protege Kutuzov , but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned . 
Moreover , toward evening , as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy , a terrible piece of news was added . 
Countess Helene Bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention . 
Officially , at large gatherings , everyone said that Countess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris , but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect ; but Helene , tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written -LRB- that wretched , profligate Pierre -RRB- had not replied , had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug , and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her . 
It was said that Prince Vasili and the old count had turned upon the Italian , but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop . 
Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts : the Emperor 's lack of news , the loss of Kutuzov , and the death of Helene . 
On the third day after Kutuzov 's report a country gentleman arrived from Moscow , and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through the whole town . 
This was terrible !
