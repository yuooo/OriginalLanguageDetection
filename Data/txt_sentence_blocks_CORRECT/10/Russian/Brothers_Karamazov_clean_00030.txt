I have mentioned already that he looked bloated . 
His countenance at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he had led . 
Besides the long fleshy bags under his little , always insolent , suspicious , and ironical eyes ; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in his little fat face , the Adam 's apple hung below his sharp chin like a great , fleshy goitre , which gave him a peculiar , repulsive , sensual appearance ; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips , between which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth . 
He slobbered every time he began to speak . 
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face , though , I believe , he was well satisfied with it . 
He used particularly to point to his nose , which was not very large , but very delicate and conspicuously aquiline . 
`` A regular Roman nose , '' he used to say , `` with my goitre I 've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of the decadent period . '' 
He seemed proud of it . 
Not long after visiting his mother 's grave Alyosha suddenly announced that he wanted to enter the monastery , and that the monks were willing to receive him as a novice . 
He explained that this was his strong desire , and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his father .
