A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up . 
`` And how 's it you 're not afraid , sir , really now ? '' 
a red-faced , broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre , with a grin that disclosed a set of sound , white teeth . 
`` Are you afraid , then ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` What else do you expect ? '' 
answered the soldier . 
`` She has no mercy , you know ! 
When she comes spluttering down , out go your innards . 
One ca n't help being afraid , '' he said laughing .
