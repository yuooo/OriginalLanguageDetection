Lise was extremely touched by his story . 
Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling . 
When he finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money , Lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out : `` So you did n't give him the money ! 
So you let him run away ! 
Oh , dear , you ought to have run after him ! '' 
`` No , Lise ; it 's better I did n't run after him , '' said Alyosha , getting up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room . 
`` How so ? 
How is it better ? 
Now they are without food and their case is hopeless . ''
