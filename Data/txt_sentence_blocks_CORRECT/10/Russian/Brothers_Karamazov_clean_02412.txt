His hands , crossed over his breast , looked particularly beautiful , as though chiselled in marble . 
There were flowers in his hands and the coffin , with flowers , which had been sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov . 
But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna , and when Alyosha opened the door , the captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear boy . 
He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in , and he would not look at anyone , even at his crazy weeping wife , `` mamma , '' who kept trying to stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy . 
Nina had been pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin . 
She sat with her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt quietly weeping . 
Snegiryov 's face looked eager , yet bewildered and exasperated . 
There was something crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him . 
`` Old man , dear old man ! '' 
he exclaimed every minute , gazing at Ilusha .
