That city is taken ; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram . 
But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal , an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur -- from the cold in his head at Borodino to the sparks which set Moscow on fire , and the frosts -- and instead of genius , stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident . 
The invaders flee , turn back , flee again , and all the chances are now not for Napoleon but always against him . 
A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east . 
Attempted drives from east to west -- similar to the contrary movements of 1805 , 1807 , and 1809 -- precede the great westward movement ; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions ; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the movement ; the same hesitation midway , and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached . 
Paris , the ultimate goal , is reached . 
The Napoleonic government and army are destroyed . 
Napoleon himself is no longer of any account ; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean , but again an inexplicable chance occurs . 
The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings . 
Deprived of power and authority , his crimes and his craft exposed , he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later -- an outlawed brigand .
