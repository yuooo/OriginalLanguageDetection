He longed to kiss his father 's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness , but said , in a careless and even rude voice , that it happens to everyone ! 
The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son 's words and began bustlingly searching for something . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he muttered , `` it will be difficult , I fear , difficult to raise ... happens to everybody ! 
Yes , who has not done it ? '' 
And with a furtive glance at his son 's face , the count went out of the room ... . 
Nicholas had been prepared for resistance , but had not at all expected this . 
`` Papa ! 
Pa-pa ! '' 
he called after him , sobbing , `` forgive me ! ''
