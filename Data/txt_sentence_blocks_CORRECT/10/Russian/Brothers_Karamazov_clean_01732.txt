`` I wo n't go away , I wo n't go away , '' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha . 
`` I 'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor 's gone , I 'll come back with Perezvon . '' 
But by now the doctor had entered , an important-looking person with long , dark whiskers and a shiny , shaven chin , wearing a bearskin coat . 
As he crossed the threshold he stopped , taken aback ; he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place . 
`` How is this ? 
Where am I ? '' 
he muttered , not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap . 
The crowd , the poverty of the room , the washing hanging on a line in the corner , puzzled him . 
The captain , bent double , was bowing low before him . 
`` It 's here , sir , here , sir , '' he muttered cringingly ; `` it 's here , you 've come right , you were coming to us ... '' `` Sne-gi-ryov ? ''
