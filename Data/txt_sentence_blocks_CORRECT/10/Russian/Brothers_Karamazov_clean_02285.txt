People talked afterwards of the end of the speech , of the prosecutor 's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe , and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch . 
`` The man could not resist boasting of his cleverness , '' they said . 
The court was adjourned , but only for a short interval , a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most . 
There was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience . 
I remember some of them . 
`` A weighty speech , '' a gentleman in one group observed gravely . 
`` He brought in too much psychology , '' said another voice . 
`` But it was all true , the absolute truth ! '' 
`` Yes , he is first rate at it . '' 
`` He summed it all up . ''
