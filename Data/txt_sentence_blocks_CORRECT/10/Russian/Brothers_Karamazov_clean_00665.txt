In fact , I believe nothing better could have happened . '' 
`` Why , why could nothing better have happened ? '' 
cried Lise , looking with great surprise at Alyosha . 
`` Because if he had taken the money , in an hour after getting home , he would be crying with mortification , that 's just what would have happened . 
And most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow , and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now . 
But now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant , though he knows he has ` ruined himself . ' 
So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by to-morrow , for he has already vindicated his honour , tossed away the money , and trampled it under foot ... . 
He could n't know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow , and yet he is in terrible need of that money . 
Though he is proud of himself now , yet even to-day he 'll be thinking what a help he has lost . 
He will think of it more than ever at night , will dream of it , and by to-morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness .
