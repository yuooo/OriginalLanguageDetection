People described with relish , afterwards , how cleverly he had `` taken down '' all the witnesses for the prosecution , and as far as possible perplexed them and , what 's more , had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of their evidence . 
But it was supposed that he did this rather by way of sport , so to speak , for professional glory , to show nothing had been omitted of the accepted methods , for all were convinced that he could do no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses , and probably was more aware of this than anyone , having some idea of his own in the background , some concealed weapon of defence , which he would suddenly reveal when the time came . 
But meanwhile , conscious of his strength , he seemed to be diverting himself . 
So , for instance , when Grigory , Fyodor Pavlovitch 's old servant , who had given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door , was examined , the counsel for the defence positively fastened upon him when his turn came to question him . 
It must be noted that Grigory entered the trial with a composed and almost stately air , not the least disconcerted by the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him . 
He gave evidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with his Marfa , only perhaps more respectfully . 
It was impossible to make him contradict himself . 
The prosecutor questioned him first in detail about the family life of the Karamazovs . 
The family picture stood out in lurid colours . 
It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and impartial .
