cried he , standing there and addressing those in the room . 
All were silent . 
`` I bet fifty imperials '' -- he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him , but he did , not speak it very well -- `` I bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred ? '' 
added he , addressing the Englishman . 
`` No , fifty , '' replied the latter . 
`` All right . 
Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth , sitting outside the window on this spot '' -LRB- he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window -RRB- `` and without holding on to anything . 
Is that right ? '' 
`` Quite right , '' said the Englishman .
