And if he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man , it shows that he was innocent of his father 's murder . 
Had he murdered him , he would never have run to another victim out of pity ; then he would have felt differently ; his thoughts would have been centred on self-preservation . 
He would have had none to spare for pity , that is beyond doubt .
