Then his lips and tongue moved , sounds came , and he began to speak , gazing timidly and imploringly at her , evidently afraid that she might not understand . 
Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him . 
The comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat . 
He said something , repeating the same words several times . 
She could not understand them , but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered . 
`` Mmm ... ar ... ate ... ate ... '' he repeated several times . 
It was quite impossible to understand these sounds . 
The doctor thought he had guessed them , and inquiringly repeated : `` Mary , are you afraid ? '' 
The prince shook his head , again repeated the same sounds .
