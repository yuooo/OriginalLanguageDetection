The monastic way is very different . 
Obedience , fasting , and prayer are laughed at , yet only through them lies the way to real , true freedom . 
I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires , I subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience , and with God 's help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy . 
Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it - the rich in his isolation or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and habits ? 
The monk is reproached for his solitude , `` You have secluded yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation , and have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity ! '' 
But we shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love . 
For it is not we , but they , who are in isolation , though they do n't see that . 
Of old , leaders of the people came from among us , and why should they not again ? 
The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great cause . 
The salvation of Russia comes from the people .
