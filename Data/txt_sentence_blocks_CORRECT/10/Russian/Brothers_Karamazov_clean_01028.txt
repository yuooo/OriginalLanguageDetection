All this became known afterwards . 
He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital and put business in her way . 
When Fyodor Pavlovitch , who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation , ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her , old Samsonov , gravely ill as he was , was immensely amused . 
It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man , and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so . 
Of late , when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love , the old man left off laughing . 
On the contrary , he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice . 
`` If you have to choose between the two , father or son , you 'd better choose the old man , if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand . 
But do n't keep on with the captain , you 'll get no good out of that . '' 
These were the very words of the old profligate , who felt already that his death was not far off and who actually died five months later . 
I will note too , in passing - that although many in our town knew of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs , father and son , the object of which was Grushenka , scarcely anyone understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them .
