And there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday : reeds , the Russian camp , and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face , vigorous and alert , entering Potemkin 's gaily colored tent , and a burning sense of jealousy of `` the favorite '' agitated him now as strongly as it had done then . 
He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Potemkin . 
And he saw before him a plump , rather sallow-faced , short , stout woman , the Empress Mother , with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him , and then that same face on the catafalque , and the encounter he had with Zubov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand . 
`` Oh , quicker , quicker ! 
To get back to that time and have done with all the present ! 
Quicker , quicker -- and that they should leave me in peace ! '' 
Bald Hills , Prince Nicholas Bolkonski 's estate , lay forty miles east from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow . 
The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpatych , Dessalles , having asked to see Princess Mary , told her that , as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety , though from Prince Andrew 's letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous , he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at Smolensk , asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed . 
Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary , she signed it , and it was given to Alpatych with instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger . 
Having received all his orders Alpatych , wearing a white beaver hat - a present from the prince -- and carrying a stick as the prince did , went out accompanied by his family .
