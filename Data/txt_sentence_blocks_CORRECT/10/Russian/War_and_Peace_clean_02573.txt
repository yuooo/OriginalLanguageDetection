`` You are Count Ilya Rostov 's son ? 
My wife was a great friend of your mother 's . 
We are at home on Thursdays -- today is Thursday , so please come and see us quite informally , '' said the governor , taking leave of him . 
Immediately on leaving the governor 's , Nicholas hired post horses and , taking his squadron quartermaster with him , drove at a gallop to the landowner , fourteen miles away , who had the stud . 
Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Voronezh and , as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind , everything went well and easily . 
The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor , an old cavalryman , a horse fancier , a sportsman , the possessor of some century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine , who had a snuggery where he smoked , and who owned some splendid horses . 
In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles -- to serve , as he said , as samples of his remounts . 
After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine , Nicholas -- having exchanged kisses with the landowner , with whom he was already on the friendliest terms -- galloped back over abominable roads , in the brightest frame of mind , continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor 's party . 
When he had changed , poured water over his head , and scented himself , Nicholas arrived at the governor 's rather late , but with the phrase `` better late than never '' on his lips . 
It was not a ball , nor had dancing been announced , but everyone knew that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing , and so everyone had come as to a ball .
