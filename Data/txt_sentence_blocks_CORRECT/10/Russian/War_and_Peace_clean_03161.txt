But Napoleon 's power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age . 
This curious contradiction is not accidental . 
Not only does it occur at every step , but the universal historians ' accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions . 
This contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway . 
To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force , the sum of the components must equal the resultant . 
This condition is never observed by the universal historians , and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit , in addition to the insufficient components , another unexplained force affecting the resultant action . 
Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of Alexander . 
But the universal historian Gervinus , refuting this opinion of the specialist historian , tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside Alexander 's will -- such as the activity of Stein , Metternich , Madame de Stael , Talleyrand , Fichte Chateaubriand , and others . 
The historian evidently decomposes Alexander 's power into the components : Talleyrand , Chateaubriand , and the rest -- but the sum of the components , that is , the interactions of Chateaubriand , Talleyrand , Madame de Stael , and the others , evidently does not equal the resultant , namely the phenomenon of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons . 
That Chateaubriand , Madame de Stael , and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions .
