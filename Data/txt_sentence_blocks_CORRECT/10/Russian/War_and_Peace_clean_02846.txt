`` Oh -- why , that was in a dream ! '' 
Petya said to himself , as he lurched forward . 
`` It 's in my ears . 
But perhaps it 's music of my own . 
Well , go on , my music ! 
Now ! 
... '' He closed his eyes , and , from all sides as if from a distance , sounds fluttered , grew into harmonies , separated , blended , and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn . 
`` Oh , this is delightful ! 
As much as I like and as I like ! '' 
said Petya to himself .
