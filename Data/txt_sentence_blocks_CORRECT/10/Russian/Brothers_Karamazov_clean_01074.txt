Rakitin got up . 
`` It 's time we were off , '' he said , `` it 's late , we shall be shut out of the monastery . '' 
Grushenka leapt up from her place . 
`` Surely you do n't want to go , Alyosha ! '' 
she cried , in mournful surprise . 
`` What are you doing to me ? 
You 've stirred up my feeling , tortured me , and now you 'll leave me to face this night alone ! '' 
`` He can hardly spend the night with you ! 
Though if he wants to , let him ! 
I 'll go alone , '' Rakitin scoffed jeeringly .
