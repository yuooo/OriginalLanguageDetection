Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject , she did not stop talking , but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened , and after the soup the prince became more genial . 
After dinner , he went to see his daughter-in-law . 
The little princess was sitting at a small table , chattering with Masha , her maid . 
She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law . 
She was much altered . 
She was now plain rather than pretty . 
Her cheeks had sunk , her lip was drawn up , and her eyes drawn down . 
`` Yes , I feel a kind of oppression , '' she said in reply to the prince 's question as to how she felt . 
`` Do you want anything ? '' 
`` No , merci , mon pere . ''
