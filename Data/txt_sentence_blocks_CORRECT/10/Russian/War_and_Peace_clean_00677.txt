`` As you see , '' he said . 
`` Indeed ? 
Yes , yes ! '' 
said Boris , with a smile . 
`` And we too have had a splendid march . 
You know , of course , that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time , so that we had every comfort and every advantage . 
What receptions we had in Poland ! 
What dinners and balls ! 
I ca n't tell you . 
And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers . ''
