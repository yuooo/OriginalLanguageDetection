I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us . 
The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him . 
We search , but none are to be found . 
The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T. , Prince V. , and others . 
Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything , seizes the letters , opens them , and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others . 
` Ah ! 
So that 's the way they treat me ! 
No confidence in me ! 
Ah , ordered to keep an eye on me ! 
Very well then !
