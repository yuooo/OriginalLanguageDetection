It was very bitter , but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it , though they were ordered not to do so , as it was a noxious plant . 
That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers , a swelling of the arms , legs , and face , which the doctors attributed to eating this root . 
But in spite of all this , the soldiers of Denisov 's squadron fed chiefly on `` Mashka 's sweet root , '' because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen . 
The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin , though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair . 
Despite this destitution , the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual . 
Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms , the hussars formed line for roll call , kept things in order , groomed their horses , polished their arms , brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder , and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry , joking about their nasty food and their hunger . 
As usual , in their spare time , they lit bonfires , steamed themselves before them naked ; smoked , picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes , told and listened to stories of Potemkin 's and Suvorov 's campaigns , or to legends of Alesha the Sly , or the priest 's laborer Mikolka . 
The officers , as usual , lived in twos and threes in the roofless , half-ruined houses . 
The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and , in general , food for the men . 
The younger ones occupied themselves as before , some playing cards -LRB- there was plenty of money , though there was no food -RRB- , some with more innocent games , such as quoits and skittles .
