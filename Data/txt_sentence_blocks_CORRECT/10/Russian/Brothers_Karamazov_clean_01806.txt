But that 's not the point , that 's not the point again . 
You see , I 'm mixing everything up . 
I am in such a hurry . 
Why am I in a hurry ? 
I do n't understand . 
It 's awful how I seem growing unable to understand anything . 
Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle . 
I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away , and that will be all I shall see of you . 
Goodness ! 
Why are we sitting here and no coffee ?
