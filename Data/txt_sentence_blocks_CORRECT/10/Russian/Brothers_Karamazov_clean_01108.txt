Mitya was well dressed , in a frock-coat , buttoned up , with a round hat and black gloves in his hands , just as he had been three days before at the elder 's , at the family meeting with his father and brothers . 
The old man waited for him , standing dignified and unbending , and Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he advanced . 
Mitya was greatly impressed , too , with Samsonov 's immensely swollen face . 
His lower lip , which had always been thick , hung down now , looking like a bun . 
He bowed to his guest in dignified silence , motioned him to a low chair by the sofa , and , leaning on his son 's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite , groaning painfully , so that Mitya , seeing his painful exertions , immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had ventured to disturb . 
`` What is it you want of me , sir ? '' 
said the old man , deliberately , distinctly , severely , but courteously , when he was at last seated . 
Mitya started , leapt up , but sat down again . 
Then he began at once speaking with loud , nervous haste , gesticulating , and in a positive frenzy . 
He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner , on the brink of ruin , catching at the last straw , ready to sink if he failed .
