The weak-minded idiot , Smerdyakov , transformed into a Byronic hero , avenging society for his illegitimate birth - is n't this a romance in the Byronic style ? 
And the son who breaks into his father 's house and murders him without murdering him is not even a romance - this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he can not solve himself . 
If he murdered him , he murdered him , and what 's the meaning of his murdering him without having murdered him - who can make head or tail of this ? 
`` Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound ideas and from this tribune of ` sound ideas ' is heard a solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father ` parricide ' is nothing but a prejudice ! 
But if parricide is a prejudice , and if every child is to ask his father why he is to love him , what will become of us ?
