I have n't time just now , '' replied Ermolov , and left the hut . 
The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good . 
As in the Austerlitz dispositions , it was written -- though not in German this time : `` The First Column will march here and here , '' `` the Second Column will march there and there , '' and so on ; and on paper , all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy . 
Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions , and as is always the case , not a single column reached its place at the appointed time . 
When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared , an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Ermolov to deal with . 
A young officer of the Horse Guards , Kutuzov 's orderly , pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him , went to Ermolov 's quarters . 
`` Gone away , '' said Ermolov 's orderly . 
The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermolov was often to be found . 
`` No , and the general 's out too . '' 
The officer , mounting his horse , rode off to someone else .
