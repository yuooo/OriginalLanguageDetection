We have heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the crime ; he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was produced in court to-day . 
` All was done as written . ' 
But , I repeat again , he was running to her , to seek her , solely to find out where she was . 
That 's a fact that ca n't be disputed . 
Had she been at home , he would not have run away , but would have remained at her side , and so would not have done what he promised in the letter . 
He ran unexpectedly and accidentally , and by that time very likely he did not even remember his drunken letter . 
` He snatched up the pestle , ' they say , and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that pestle - why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon , to snatch it up , and so on , and so on . 
A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point : What if that pestle had not been in sight , had not been lying on the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner , but had been put away in a cupboard ? 
It would not have caught the prisoner 's eye , and he would have run away without a weapon , with empty hands , and then he would certainly not have killed anyone . 
How then can I look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation ?
