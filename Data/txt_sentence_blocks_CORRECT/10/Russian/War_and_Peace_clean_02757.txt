`` But this is very important , from General Dokhturov , '' said Bolkhovitinov , entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark . 
The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody . 
`` Your honor , your honor ! 
A courier . '' 
`` What ? 
What 's that ? 
From whom ? '' 
came a sleepy voice . 
`` From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich . 
Napoleon is at Forminsk , '' said Bolkhovitinov , unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn .
