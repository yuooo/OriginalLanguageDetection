She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she , too , would be sewn up with cords .

While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room . 
`` They have brought the cock , Miss , '' she said in a whisper . 
`` It is n't wanted , Petya .
