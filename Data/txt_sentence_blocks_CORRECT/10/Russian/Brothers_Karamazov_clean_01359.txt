But now ? 
Was it the same as then ? 
Now one phantom , one terror at least was at an end : that first , rightful lover , that fateful figure had vanished , leaving no trace . 
The terrible phantom had turned into something so small , so comic ; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in . 
It would never return . 
She was ashamed , and from her eyes he could see now whom she loved . 
Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go on living , he could not ; oh , damnation ! 
`` O God ! 
restore to life the man I knocked down at the fence ! 
Let this fearful cup pass from me !
