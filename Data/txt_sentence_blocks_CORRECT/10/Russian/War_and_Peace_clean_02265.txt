Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost . 
Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Fili was impossible , but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow , he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the French right flank the following day . 
Opinions were divided , and arguments were advanced for and against that project . 
Ermolov , Dokhturov , and Raevski agreed with Bennigsen . 
Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other , personal considerations , these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned . 
The other generals , however , understood it and , leaving aside the question of Moscow , of the direction the army should take in its retreat . 
Malasha , who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her , understood the meaning of the council differently . 
It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between `` Granddad '' and `` Long-coat '' as she termed Bennigsen . 
She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another , and in her heart she sided with `` Granddad . '' 
In the midst of the conversation she noticed `` Granddad '' give Bennigsen a quick , subtle glance , and then to her joys he saw that `` Granddad '' said something to `` Long-coat '' which settled him .
