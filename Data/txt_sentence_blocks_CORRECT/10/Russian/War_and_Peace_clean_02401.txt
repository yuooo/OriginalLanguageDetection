The young officer standing in the gateway , as if hesitating whether to enter or not , clicked his tongue . 
`` Ah , how annoying ! '' 
he muttered . 
`` I should have come yesterday ... . 
Ah , what a pity . '' 
Meanwhile , Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar Rostov features of the young man 's face , his tattered coat and trodden-down boots . 
`` What did you want to see the count for ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Oh well ... it ca n't be helped ! '' 
said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave .
