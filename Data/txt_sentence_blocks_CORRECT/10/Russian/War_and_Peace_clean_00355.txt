At Bykov 's , at the rat 's ... I knew it , '' replied a piping voice , and Lieutenant Telyanin , a small officer of the same squadron , entered the room . 
Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him . 
Telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign . 
He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked ; Rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man . 
`` Well , young cavalryman , how is my Rook behaving ? '' 
he asked . 
-LRB- Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov . -RRB- 
The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face ; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another . 
`` I saw you riding this morning ... '' he added . 
`` Oh , he 's all right , a good horse , '' answered Rostov , though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum .
