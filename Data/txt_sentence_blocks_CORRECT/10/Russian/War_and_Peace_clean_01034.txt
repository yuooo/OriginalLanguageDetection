And Prince Vasili had to go without receiving any explanation . 
A week later , Pierre , having taken leave of his new friends , the Masons , and leaving large sums of money with them for alms , went away to his estates . 
His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity . 
The duel between Pierre and Dolokhov was hushed up and , in spite of the Emperor 's severity regarding duels at that time , neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it . 
But the story of the duel , confirmed by Pierre 's rupture with his wife , was the talk of society . 
Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son , and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia , had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage -- when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him -- especially as he did not know how , and did not wish , to court society 's favor . 
Now he alone was blamed for what had happened , he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage . 
And when after Pierre 's departure Helene returned to Petersburg , she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially , but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune . 
When conversation turned on her husband Helene assumed a dignified expression , which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance . 
This expression suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God .
