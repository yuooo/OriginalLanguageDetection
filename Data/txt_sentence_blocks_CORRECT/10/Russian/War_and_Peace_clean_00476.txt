Passing by Kutuzov 's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite , with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together , Prince Andrew entered the passage . 
Kutuzov himself , he was told , was in the house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother . 
Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt . 
In the passage little Kozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk . 
The clerk , with cuffs turned up , was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards . 
Kozlovski 's face looked worn -- he too had evidently not slept all night . 
He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him .
