A father is jealous of his son 's relation with a woman of loose behaviour and intrigues with the creature to get his son into prison ! 
This is the company in which I have been forced to be present ! 
I was deceived . 
I declare to you all that I was as much deceived as anyone . '' 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly , in an unnatural voice , `` if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a duel ... with pistols , at three paces ... across a handkerchief , '' he ended , stamping with both feet . 
With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest , although at that very moment , or a second later , they are able to whisper to themselves , `` You know you are lying , you shameless old sinner ! 
You 're acting now , in spite of your ` holy ' wrath . '' 
Dmitri frowned painfully , and looked with unutterable contempt at his father . 
`` I thought ... I thought , '' he said . 
in a soft and , as it were , controlled voice , `` that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart , my betrothed , to cherish his old age , and I find nothing but a depraved profligate , a despicable clown ! ''
