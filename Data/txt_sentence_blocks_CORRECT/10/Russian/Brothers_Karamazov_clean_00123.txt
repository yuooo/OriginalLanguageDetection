said her mother impressively , though she smiled after she had said it . 
`` You have quite forgotten us , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said ; `` you never come to see us .

He had begun talking to a monk who , as mentioned before , had been awaiting his entrance by Lise 's chair . 
He was evidently a monk of the humblest , that is of the peasant , class , of a narrow outlook , but a true believer , and , in his own way , a stubborn one . 
He announced that he had come from the far north , from Obdorsk , from Saint Sylvester , and was a member of a poor monastery , consisting of only ten monks . 
The elder gave him his blessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked . 
`` How can you presume to do such deeds ? ''
