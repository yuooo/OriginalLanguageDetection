`` I am beginning to understand you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor said slowly , a soft and almost compassionate tone . 
`` But all this , if you 'll excuse my saying so , is a matter of nerves , in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves , that 's what it is . 
And why , for instance , should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month , by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you ? 
And why could you not have explained things to her , and in view of your position , which you describe as being so awful , why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one 's mind , that is , after honourably confessing your errors to her , why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses , which , with her generous heart , she would certainly not have refused you in your distress , especially if it had been with some guarantee , or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov , and to Madame Hohlakov ? 
I suppose you still regard that security as of value ? '' 
Mitya suddenly crimsoned . 
`` Surely you do n't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that ? 
You ca n't be speaking in earnest ? '' 
he said , with indignation , looking the prosecutor straight in the face , and seeming unable to believe his ears . 
`` I assure you I 'm in earnest ... Why do you imagine I 'm not serious ? ''
