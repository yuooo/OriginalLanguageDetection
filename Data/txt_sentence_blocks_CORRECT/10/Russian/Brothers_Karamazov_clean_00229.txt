`` Who else ? 
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn . '' 
`` But I am not von Sohn either . 
I am Maximov . '' 
`` No , you are von Sohn . 
Your reverence , do you know who von Sohn was ? 
It was a famous murder case . 
He was killed in a house of harlotry - I believe that is what such places are called among you - he was killed and robbed , and in spite of his venerable age , he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van , and while they were nailing him up , the harlots sang songs and played the harp , that is to say , the piano . 
So this is that very von Solin . 
He has risen from the dead , has n't he , von Sohn ? ''
