`` If you liked him too , it would be a good thing for you to get married , '' he added rather more quickly , as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking . 
Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her , except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living . 
`` Why talk of me ? '' 
she said quietly and glanced at Natasha . 
Natasha , who felt her glance , did not look at her . 
All three were again silent . 
`` Andrew , would you like ... '' Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling voice , `` would you like to see little Nicholas ? 
He is always talking about you ! '' 
Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time , but Princess Mary , who knew his face so well , saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son , but with quiet , gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him . 
`` Yes , I shall be very glad to see him .
