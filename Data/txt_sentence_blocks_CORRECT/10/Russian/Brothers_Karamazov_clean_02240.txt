As for the prisoner , the tragedy of his fate is evident ; it is before us . 
But such was the young person 's ` game . ' 
The enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment , when he knelt before her , stretching out hands that were already stained with the blood of his father and rival .

`` The talented young man , to whom I have referred already , Mr. Rakitin , characterised this heroine in brief and impressive terms : ` She was disillusioned early in life , deceived and ruined by a betrothed , who seduced and abandoned her . 
She was left in poverty , cursed by her respectable family and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man , whom she still , however , considers as her benefactor . 
There was perhaps much that was good in her young heart , but it was embittered too early . 
She became prudent and saved money . 
She grew sarcastic and resentful against society . '
