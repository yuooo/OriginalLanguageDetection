`` See how it 's flaring , '' said one . 
`` That 's a fire in Moscow : either in the Sushchevski or the Rogozhski quarter . '' 
No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance . 
Old Daniel Terentich , the count 's valet -LRB- as he was called -RRB- , came up to the group and shouted at Mishka . 
`` What are you staring at , you good-for-nothing ? 
... The count will be calling and there 's nobody there ; go and gather the clothes together . '' 
`` I only ran out to get some water , '' said Mishka . 
`` But what do you think , Daniel Terentich ? 
Does n't it look as if that glow were in Moscow ? '' 
remarked one of the footmen .
