So he , Mitya , had thrown the business up for the time , knowing nothing about the law , but on coming here was struck dumb by a cross - claim made upon him -LRB- here Mitya went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward -RRB- , `` so will not you , excellent and honoured Kuzma Kuzmitch , be willing to take up all my claims against that unnatural monster , and pay me a sum down of only three thousand ? 
... You see , you can not , in any case , lose over it . 
On my honour , my honour , I swear that . 
Quite the contrary , you may make six or seven thousand instead of three . '' 
Above all , he wanted this concluded that very day . 
`` I 'll do the business with you at a notary 's , or whatever it is ... in fact , I 'm ready to do anything . . . 
I 'll hand over all the deeds ... whatever you want , sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at once ... and if it were possible , if it were only possible , that very morning ... . 
You could pay me that three thousand , for there is n't a capitalist in this town to compare with you , and so would save me from ... save me , in fact ... for a good , I might say an honourable action ... . 
For I cherish the most honourable feelings for a certain person , whom you know well , and care for as a father . 
I would not have come , indeed , if it had not been as a father .
