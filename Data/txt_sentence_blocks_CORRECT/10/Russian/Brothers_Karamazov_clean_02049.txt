He had , however , consulted the new doctor , who had been brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna 's to which I have referred already . 
After listening to him and examining him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the brain , and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him . 
`` Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition , '' the doctor opined , ` though it would be better to verify them ... you must take steps at once , without a moment 's delay , or things will go badly with you . '' 
But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to his bed to be nursed . 
`` I am walking about , so I am strong enough , if I drop , it 'll be different then , anyone may nurse me who likes , '' he decided , dismissing the subject . 
And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and , as I have said already , looking persistently at some object on the sofa against the opposite wall . 
Someone appeared to be sitting there , though goodness knows how he had come in , for he had not been in the room when Ivan came into it , on his return from Smerdyakov . 
This was a person or , more accurately speaking , a Russian gentleman of a particular kind , no longer young , qui faisait la cinquantaine , * as the French say , with rather long , still thick , dark hair , slightly streaked with grey and a small pointed beard . 
He was wearing a brownish reefer jacket , rather shabby , evidently made by a good tailor though , and of a fashion at least three years old , that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two years . 
His linen and his long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at being stylish , but on closer inspection his linen was not overclean and his wide scarf was very threadbare .
