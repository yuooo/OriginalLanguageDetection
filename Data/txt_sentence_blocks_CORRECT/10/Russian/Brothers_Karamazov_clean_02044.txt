Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him . 
Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds . 
`` Well , you can go , '' he said , with a wave of his hand . 
`` Ivan Fyodorovitch ! '' 
he called after him again . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
Ivan turned without stopping . 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` Till to-morrow ! '' 
Ivan cried again , and he walked out of the cottage .
