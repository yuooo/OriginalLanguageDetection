`` Idiot ! '' 
she screamed at her brother and , running to a chair , threw herself on it , sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time . 
`` It 's nothing , Mamma , really it 's nothing ; only Petya startled me , '' she said , trying to smile , but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her . 
The mummers -LRB- some of the house serfs -RRB- dressed up as bears , Turks , innkeepers , and ladies -- frightening and funny -- bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety , crowded , at first timidly , into the anteroom , then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where , shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily , they started singing , dancing , and playing Christmas games . 
The countess , when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes , went into the drawing room . 
The count sat in the ballroom , smiling radiantly and applauding the players . 
The young people had disappeared . 
Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt -- this was Nicholas . 
A Turkish girl was Petya . 
A clown was Dimmler .
