`` A courier has arrived and there 's a letter for you . '' 
`` Well , all right , thanks . 
You can go ! '' 
Nicholas took the two letters , one of which was from his mother and the other from Sonya . 
He recognized them by the handwriting and opened Sonya 's first . 
He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy . 
`` No , it 's not possible ! '' 
he cried aloud . 
Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it . 
He glanced through it , then read it again , and then again , and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders , stretching out his hands , with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed .
