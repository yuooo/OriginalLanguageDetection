Tushin turned round in dismay . 
It was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at Grunth . 
He was shouting in a gasping voice : `` Are you mad ? 
You have twice been ordered to retreat , and you ... '' `` Why are they down on me ? '' 
thought Tushin , looking in alarm at his superior . 
`` I. . . 
do n't ... '' he muttered , holding up two fingers to his cap . 
`` I. . . '' 
But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say . 
A cannon ball , flying close to him , caused him to duck and bend over his horse .
