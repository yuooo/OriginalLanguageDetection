`` They say the ball will be very good , '' replied the princess , drawing up her downy little lip . 
`` All the pretty women in society will be there . '' 
`` Not all , for you will not be there ; not all , '' said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully ; and snatching the shawl from the footman , whom he even pushed aside , he began wrapping it round the princess . 
Either from awkwardness or intentionally -LRB- no one could have said which -RRB- after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time , as though embracing her . 
Still smiling , she gracefully moved away , turning and glancing at her husband . 
Prince Andrew 's eyes were closed , so weary and sleepy did he seem . 
`` Are you ready ? '' 
he asked his wife , looking past her . 
Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak , which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels , and , stumbling in it , ran out into the porch following the princess , whom a footman was helping into the carriage . 
`` Princesse , au revoir , '' cried he , stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet .
