He dressed in Russian style , with a shirt buttoning down on one side , and a full-skirted coat . 
He had saved a good sum of money , but was for ever dreaming of improving his position . 
More than half the peasants were in his clutches , everyone in the neighbourhood was in debt to him . 
From the neighbouring landowners he bought and rented lands which were worked by the peasants , in payment of debts which they could never shake off . 
He was a widower , with four grown-up daughters . 
One of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two children , his grandchildren , and worked for him like a charwoman . 
Another of his daughters was married to a petty official , and in one of the rooms of the inn , on the wall could be seen , among the family photographs , a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes . 
The two younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses , fitting tight at the back , and with trains a yard long , on Church holidays or when they went to pay visits . 
But next morning they would get up at dawn , as usual , sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom , empty the slops , and clean up after lodgers . 
In spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved , Trifon Borissovitch was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest , and remembering that not a month ago he had , in twenty-four hours , made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri , when he had come on his escapade with Grushenka , he met him now with eager welcome , scenting his prey the moment Mitya drove up to the steps .
