He had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do , that is , as a possible wife , adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life : a white dressing gown , his wife at the tea table , his wife 's carriage , little ones , Mamma and Papa , their relations to her , and so on -- and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure . 
But with Princess Mary , to whom they were trying to get him engaged , he could never picture anything of future married life . 
If he tried , his pictures seemed incongruous and false . 
It made him afraid . 
The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino , of our losses in killed and wounded , and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached Voronezh in the middle of September . 
Princess Mary , having learned of her brother 's wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of him , prepared -LRB- so Nicholas heard , he had not seen her again himself -RRB- to set off in search of Prince Andrew . 
When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the abandonment of Moscow , Rostov was not seized with despair , anger , the desire for vengeance , or any feeling of that kind , but everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome , and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness . 
The conversations he heard seemed to him insincere ; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him . 
He made haste to finish buying the horses , and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster . 
A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving , at which Nicholas was present , was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory .
