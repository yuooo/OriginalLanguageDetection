`` Please be quick , '' he said . 
The coin was a new one . 
Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin . 
`` Allow me to look at your purse , '' he said in a low , almost inaudible , voice . 
With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised , Telyanin handed him the purse . 
`` Yes , it 's a nice purse . 
Yes , yes , '' he said , growing suddenly pale , and added , `` Look at it , young man . '' 
Rostov took the purse in his hand , examined it and the money in it , and looked at Telyanin . 
The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry . 
`` If we get to Vienna I 'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there 's nowhere to spend it , '' said he .
