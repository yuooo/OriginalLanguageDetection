In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him , but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people . 
Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow ; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow , and the Emperor Alexander , helped by the advice of Stein and others , united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace . 
All Napoleon 's allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised . 
The Allies defeated Napoleon , entered Paris , forced Napoleon to abdicate , and sent him to the island of Elba , not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect , though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand . 
Then Louis XVIII , who till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the Allies , began to reign . 
And Napoleon , shedding tears before his Old Guards , renounced the throne and went into exile . 
Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists -LRB- especially Talleyrand , who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of France -RRB- talked in Vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy . 
Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another , but just then Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion , and the French , who had been hating him , immediately all submitted to him . 
But the Allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the French once more . 
And they defeated the genius Napoleon and , suddenly recognizing him as a brigand , sent him to the island of St. Helena .
