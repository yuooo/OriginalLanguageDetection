`` Yes . '' 
`` Your honor , you 're wanted by the general . 
He is in the hut here , '' said a gunner , coming up to Tushin . 
`` Coming , friend . '' 
Tushin rose and , buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight , walked away from the fire . 
Not far from the artillery campfire , in a hut that had been prepared for him , Prince Bagration sat at dinner , talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters . 
The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone , and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years , flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner ; and the staff officer with the signet ring , and Zherkov , uneasily glancing at them all , and Prince Andrew , pale , with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes . 
In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French , and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture , shaking his head in perplexity -- perhaps because the banner really interested him , perhaps because it was hard for him , hungry as he was , to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him . 
In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons . 
Our officers were flocking in to look at him .
