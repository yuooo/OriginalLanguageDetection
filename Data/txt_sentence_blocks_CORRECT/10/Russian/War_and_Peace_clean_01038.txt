That is the actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet , '' said the Danish charge d'affaires . 
`` The doubt is flattering , '' said `` the man of profound intellect , '' with a subtle smile . 
`` We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of Austria , '' said Mortemart . 
`` The Emperor of Austria can never have thought of such a thing , it is only the cabinet that says it . '' 
`` Ah , my dear vicomte , '' put in Anna Pavlovna , `` L'Urope '' -LRB- for some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a Frenchman -RRB- , `` L'Urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere . '' 
* * `` Europe will never be our sincere ally . '' 
After that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King of Prussia , in order to draw Boris into the conversation . 
Boris listened attentively to each of the speakers , awaiting his turn , but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor , the beautiful Helene , whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile . 
Speaking of the position of Prussia , Anna Pavlovna very naturally asked Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he found the Prussian army . 
Boris , speaking with deliberation , told them in pure , correct French many interesting details about the armies and the court , carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts he was recounting .
