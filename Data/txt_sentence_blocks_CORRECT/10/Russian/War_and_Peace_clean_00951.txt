`` None but fools trust to luck in play , '' Dolokhov had then said . 
`` Or are you afraid to play with me ? '' 
Dolokhov now asked as if guessing Rostov 's thought . 
Beneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the Club dinner and at other times , when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange , and usually cruel , action . 
Rostov felt ill at ease . 
He tried , but failed , to find some joke with which to reply to Dolokhov 's words . 
But before he had thought of anything , Dolokhov , looking straight in his face , said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear : `` Do you remember we had a talk about cards ... ` He 's a fool who trusts to luck , one should make certain , ' and I want to try . '' 
`` To try his luck or the certainty ? '' 
Rostov asked himself . 
`` Well , you 'd better not play , '' Dolokhov added , and springing a new pack of cards said : `` Bank , gentlemen ! ''
