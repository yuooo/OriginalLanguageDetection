On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth . 
O God , help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways ! 
Read the Scriptures , but without proper feeling . 
Brother Urusov came and we talked about worldly vanities . 
He told me of the Emperor 's new projects . 
I began to criticize them , but remembered my rules and my benefactor 's words -- that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist . 
My tongue is my enemy . 
Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother . 
They laid on me the duty of Rhetor . 
I feel myself weak and unworthy .
