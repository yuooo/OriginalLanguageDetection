`` No , bwother , I have gwown mustaches myself , '' said Denisov on reading these documents , and he wrote to the German that , despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general , he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish general . 
To the Polish general he replied to the same effect , informing him that he was already under the command of the German . 
Having arranged matters thus , Denisov and Dolokhov intended , without reporting matters to the higher command , to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces . 
On October 22 it was moving from the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo . 
To the left of the road between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were large forests , extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it . 
Through these forests Denisov and his party rode all day , sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge , but never losing sight of the moving French . 
That morning , Cossacks of Denisov 's party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles , which had stuck in the mud not far from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road . 
Since then , and until evening , the party had the movements of the French without attacking . 
It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then , after joining Dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman 's hut in the forest less than a mile from Shamshevo , to surprise the French at dawn , falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides , and rout and capture them all at one blow . 
In their rear , more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest came right up to the road , six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of French should show themselves .
