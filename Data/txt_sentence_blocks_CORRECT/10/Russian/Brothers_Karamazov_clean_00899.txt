`` Why , '' asked the boy , `` is Christ with them too ? '' 
`` It can not but be so , '' said I , `` since the Word is for all . 
All creation and all creatures , every leaf is striving to the Word , singing glory to God , weeping to Christ , unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of their sinless life . 
Yonder , '' said I , `` in the forest wanders the dreadful bear , fierce and menacing , and yet innocent in it . '' 
And I told him how once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood . 
And the great saint pitied him , went up to him without fear and gave him a piece of bread . 
`` Go along , '' said he , `` Christ be with you , '' and the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently , doing no harm . 
And the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint , and that Christ was with him too . 
`` Ah , '' said he , `` how good that is , how good and beautiful is all God 's work ! '' 
He sat musing softly and sweetly .
