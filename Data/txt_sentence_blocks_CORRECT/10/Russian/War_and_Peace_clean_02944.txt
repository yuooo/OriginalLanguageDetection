said one of the soldiers , winking and turning mockingly to Ramballe . 
`` Oh , you fool ! 
Why talk rubbish , lout that you are -- a real peasant ! '' 
came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier . 
They surrounded Ramballe , lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers , and carried him to the hut . 
Ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively : `` Oh , you fine fellows , my kind , kind friends ! 
These are men ! 
Oh , my brave , kind friends , '' and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child . 
Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire , surrounded by the soldiers . 
Morel , a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes , was wearing a woman 's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap .
