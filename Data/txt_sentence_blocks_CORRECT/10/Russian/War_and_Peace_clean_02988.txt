Pierre was shown into the large , brightly lit dining room ; a few minutes later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Natasha . 
Natasha was calm , though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face . 
They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk . 
It is impossible to go back to the same conversation , to talk of trifles is awkward , and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation . 
They went silently to table . 
The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again . 
Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and , resolving to break the silence , looked at Natasha and at Princess Mary . 
They had evidently both formed the same resolution ; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy . 
`` Do you take vodka , Count ? '' 
asked Princess Mary , and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past .
