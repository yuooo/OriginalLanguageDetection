He was alone now , except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire , warming his thin yellow body . 
`` Nobody wants me ! '' 
thought Rostov . 
`` There is no one to help me or pity me . 
Yet I was once at home , strong , happy , and loved . '' 
He sighed and , doing so , groaned involuntarily . 
`` Eh , is anything hurting you ? '' 
asked the soldier , shaking his shirt out over the fire , and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added : `` What a lot of men have been crippled today -- frightful ! '' 
Rostov did not listen to the soldier . 
He looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm , bright home , his fluffy fur coat , his quickly gliding sleigh , his healthy body , and all the affection and care of his family .
