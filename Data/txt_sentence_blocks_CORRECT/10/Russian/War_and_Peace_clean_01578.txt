To get better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance , and Natasha moved over to it . 
The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls . 
In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen . 
The king waved his right arm and , evidently nervous , sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne . 
The maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue , now wore only a smock , and stood beside the throne with her hair down . 
She sang something mournfully , addressing the queen , but the king waved his arm severely , and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together . 
Then the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms , separating from the others , went behind the wings , adjusted her bodice , returned to the middle of the stage , and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other . 
In the stalls everyone clapped and shouted `` bravo ! '' 
Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage . 
The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly , and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly .
