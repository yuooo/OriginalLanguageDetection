`` You are upset about something ? '' 
`` On the contrary , I am very happy . 
I 've only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your wife . 
You are not fit to be a husband . 
If I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after you , you 'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back , too . 
If you were forty , you would still go on taking my love-letters for me . '' 
She suddenly laughed . 
`` There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you , '' Alyosha smiled to her . 
`` The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you . 
What 's more , I do n't want to feel ashamed with you , just with you .
