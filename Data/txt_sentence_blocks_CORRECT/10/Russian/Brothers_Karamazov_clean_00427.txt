I shall never forget it . 
I 've a word to say to you to-morrow - but I must think about it . '' 
`` And how do you feel now ? '' 
`` I shall get up to-morrow and go out , perfectly well , perfectly well ! '' 
Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway . 
He was sitting writing something in pencil in his notebook . 
Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up , was conscious , and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery . 
`` Alyosha , I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning , '' said Ivan cordially , standing up . 
His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha . 
`` I shall be at the Hohlakovs ' to-morrow , '' answered Alyosha , `` I may be at Katerina Ivanovna 's , too , if I do n't find her now . ''
