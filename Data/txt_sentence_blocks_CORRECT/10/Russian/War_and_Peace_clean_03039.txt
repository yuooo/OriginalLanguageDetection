Do you now see that it was not he but I who moved you ? '' 
But dazed by the force of the movement , it was long before people understood this . 
Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of Alexander I , the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west . 
What was needed for him who , overshadowing others , stood at the head of that movement from east to west ? 
What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European affairs , but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests ; a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him ; a mild and attractive personality ; and a personal grievance against Napoleon . 
And all this was found in Alexander I ; all this had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life : his education , his early liberalism , the advisers who surrounded him , and by Austerlitz , and Tilsit , and Erfurt . 
During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed . 
But as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and , uniting the nations of Europe , led them to the goal . 
The goal is reached . 
After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all possible power .
