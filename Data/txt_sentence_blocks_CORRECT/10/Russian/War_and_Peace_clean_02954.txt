Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite - Count Tolstoy , Prince Volkonski , Arakcheev , and others -- the Emperor reached Vilna on the eleventh , and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle . 
In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle , as well as a guard of honor of the Semenov regiment . 
A courier who galloped to the castle in advance , in a troyka with three foam-flecked horses , shouted `` Coming ! '' 
and Konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform Kutuzov , who was waiting in the hall porter 's little lodge . 
A minute later the old man 's large stout figure in full-dress uniform , his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach , waddled out into the porch . 
He put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and , holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street , took in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor . 
There was running to and fro and whispering ; another troyka furiously up , and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be descried . 
From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general . 
He carefully and hastily felt himself all over , readjusted his hat , and pulling himself together drew himself up and , at the very moment when the Emperor , having alighted from the sleigh , lifted his eyes to him , handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth , ingratiating voice . 
The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot , frowned for an instant , but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man , extended his arms and embraced him .
