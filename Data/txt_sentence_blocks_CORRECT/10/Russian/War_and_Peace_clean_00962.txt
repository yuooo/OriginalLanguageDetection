Twenty-one rubles , '' he said , pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand ; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal . 
Rostov submissively unbent the corner of his card and , instead of the six thousand he had intended , carefully wrote twenty-one . 
`` It 's all the same to me , '' he said . 
`` I only want to see whether you will let me win this ten , or beat it . '' 
Dolokhov began to deal seriously . 
Oh , how Rostov detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists , which held him in their power ... . 
The ten fell to him . 
`` You owe forty-three thousand , Count , '' said Dolokhov , and stretching himself he rose from the table . 
`` One does get tired sitting so long , '' he added . 
`` Yes , I 'm tired too , '' said Rostov .
