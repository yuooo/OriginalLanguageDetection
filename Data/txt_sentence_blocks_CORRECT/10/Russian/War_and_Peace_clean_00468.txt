Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle , evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart , a cabriolet , and a caleche . 
A soldier was driving , and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle . 
Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle . 
An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman 's vehicle for trying to get ahead of others , and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage . 
The woman screamed piercingly . 
Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and , waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl , cried : `` Mr. Aide-de-camp ! 
Mr. Aide-de-camp ! 
... For heaven 's sake ... Protect me ! 
What will become of us ? 
I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs ... .
