The visitor was Bitski , who served on various committees , frequented all the societies in Petersburg , and a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of Speranski , and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger -- one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion , but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans . 
Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew 's room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking . 
He had just heard particulars of that morning 's sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor , and he spoke of it enthusiastically . 
The Emperor 's speech had been extraordinary . 
It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver . 
`` The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm , he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases . 
The Emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published , '' recounted Bitski , emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly . 
`` Ah , yes ! 
Today 's events mark an epoch , the greatest epoch in our history , '' he concluded . 
Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of State , which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance , and was surprised that this event , now that it had taken place , did not affect him , and even seemed quite insignificant .
