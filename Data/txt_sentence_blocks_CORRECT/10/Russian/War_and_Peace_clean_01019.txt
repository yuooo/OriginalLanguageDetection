6 . 
Generosity . 
7 . 
The love of death . 
`` In the seventh place , try , by the frequent thought of death , '' the Rhetor said , `` to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe , but as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life , and leads it to its place of recompense and peace . '' 
`` Yes , that must be so , '' thought Pierre , when after these words the Rhetor went away , leaving him to solitary meditation . 
`` It must be so , but I am still so weak that I love my life , the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me . '' 
But five of the other virtues which Pierre recalled , counting them on his fingers , he felt already in his soul : courage , generosity , morality , love of mankind , and especially obedience -- which did not even seem to him a virtue , but a joy . 
-LRB- He now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth . -RRB- 
He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it .
