Pierre knew this , but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking , going over its minutest details in his mind . 
In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon , but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance . 
`` Yes , alone , for the sake of all , I must do it or perish ! '' 
he thought . 
`` Yes , I will approach ... and then suddenly ... with pistol or dagger ? 
But that is all the same ! 
` It is not I but the hand of Providence that punishes thee , ' I shall say , '' thought he , imagining what he would say when killing Napoleon . 
`` Well then , take me and execute me ! '' 
he went on , speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression . 
While Pierre , standing in the middle of the room , was talking to himself in this way , the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of Makar Alexeevich , always so timid before but now quite transformed .
