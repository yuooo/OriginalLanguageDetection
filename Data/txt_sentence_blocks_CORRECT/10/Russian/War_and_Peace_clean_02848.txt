With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song , the drip from the trees , and the hissing of the saber , `` Ozheg-zheg-zheg ... '' and again the horses jostled one another and neighed , not disturbing the choir but joining in it . 
Petya did not know how long this lasted : he enjoyed himself all the time , wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it . 
He was awakened by Likhachev 's kindly voice . 
`` It 's ready , your honor ; you can split a Frenchman in half with it ! '' 
Petya woke up . 
`` It 's getting light , it 's really getting light ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails , and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches . 
Petya shook himself , jumped up , took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to Likhachev ; then he flourished the saber , tested it , and sheathed it . 
The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths .
