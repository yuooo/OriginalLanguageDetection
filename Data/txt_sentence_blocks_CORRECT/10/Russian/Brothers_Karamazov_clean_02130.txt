In my opinion , they were wrong , and our prosecutor was , I believe , a character of greater depth than was generally supposed . 
But with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later . 
As for the President of our Court , I can only say that he was a humane and cultured man , who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressive views . 
He was rather ambitious , but did not concern himself greatly about his future career . 
The great aim of his life was to be a man of advanced ideas . 
He was , too , a man of connections and property . 
He felt , as we learnt afterwards , rather strongly about the Karamazov case , but from a social , not from a personal standpoint . 
He was interested in it as a social phenomenon , in its classification and its character as a product of our social conditions , as typical of the national character , and so on , and so on . 
His attitude to the personal aspect of the case , to its tragic significance and the persons involved in it , including the prisoner , was rather indifferent and abstract , as was perhaps fitting , indeed . 
The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their appearance .
