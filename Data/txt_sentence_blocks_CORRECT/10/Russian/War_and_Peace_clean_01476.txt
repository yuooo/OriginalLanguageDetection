`` Look , his mustache and eyelashes are all white ! '' 
said one of the strange , pretty , unfamiliar people -- the one with fine eyebrows and mustache . 
`` I think this used to be Natasha , '' thought Nicholas , `` and that was Madame Schoss , but perhaps it 's not , and this Circassian with the mustache I do n't know , but I love her . '' 
`` Are n't you cold ? '' 
he asked . 
They did not answer but began to laugh . 
Dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something -- probably something funny -- but they could not make out what he said . 
`` Yes , yes ! '' 
some voices answered , laughing .
