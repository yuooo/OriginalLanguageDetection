The family separated on the most friendly terms . 
After supper Nicholas , having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him , went to the bedroom in his dressing gown , where he found his wife still at her table , writing . 
`` What are you writing , Mary ? '' 
Nicholas asked . 
Countess Mary blushed . 
She was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband . 
She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him , but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him . 
`` A diary , Nicholas , '' she replied , handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm , bold writing . 
`` A diary ? '' 
Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony , and he took up the book .
