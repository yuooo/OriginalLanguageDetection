`` Today -- it was the same affair . 
Oh , Mary , do n't remind me of it ! '' 
and again he flushed . 
`` I give you my word of honor it sha n't occur again , and let this always be a reminder to me , '' and he pointed to the broken ring . 
After that , when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench , Nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry . 
But he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth , and then he would go and confess to his wife , and would again promise that this should really be the very last time . 
`` Mary , you must despise me ! '' 
he would say . 
`` I deserve it . '' 
`` You should go , go away at once , if you do n't feel strong enough to control yourself , '' she would reply sadly , trying to comfort her husband .
