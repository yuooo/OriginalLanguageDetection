Now he rode beside Ilyin under the birch trees , occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand , sometimes touching his horse 's side with his foot , or , without turning round , handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him , with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride .
