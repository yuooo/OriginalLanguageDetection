Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general 's views more warmly than anyone else , and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook , which he asked permission to read to them . 
In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme , totally different from Armfeldt 's or Pfuel 's plan of campaign . 
In answer to Toll , Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack , which , he urged , could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap -LRB- as he called the Drissa camp -RRB- in which we were situated . 
During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter , Wolzogen -LRB- his `` bridge '' in court relations -RRB- , were silent . 
Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away , to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing . 
So when Prince Volkonski , who was in the chair , called on him to give his opinion , he merely said : `` Why ask me ? 
General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear , or why not this Italian gentleman 's attack -- very fine , or a retreat , also good ! 
Why ask me ? '' 
said he . 
`` Why , you yourselves know everything better than I do . ''
