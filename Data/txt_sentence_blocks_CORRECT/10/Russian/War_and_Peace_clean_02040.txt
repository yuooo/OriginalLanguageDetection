He had proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kutuzov . 
The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation was too extended , and it proposed that instead of , or concurrently with , action on the front to bar the advance of the French , we should attack their line of communication . 
He began explaining his plan to Prince Andrew . 
`` They ca n't hold all that line . 
It 's impossible . 
I will undertake to bweak thwough . 
Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line , that 's certain ! 
There 's only one way -- guewilla warfare ! '' 
Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to Bolkonski . 
In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army , growing more incoherent and more diffused , mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held .
