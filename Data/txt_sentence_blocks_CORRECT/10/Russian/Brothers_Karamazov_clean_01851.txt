You are not laughing ? '' 
`` It 's true . '' 
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent . 
`` Alyosha , come and see me , come and see me more often , '' she said suddenly , in a supplicating voice . 
`` I 'll always come to see you , all my life , '' answered Alyosha firmly . 
`` You are the only person I can talk to , you know , '' Lise began again . 
`` I talk to no one but myself and you . 
Only you in the whole world . 
And to you more readily than to myself .
