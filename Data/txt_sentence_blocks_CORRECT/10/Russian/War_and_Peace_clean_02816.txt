`` Yes , yes , call him . 
A poor little fellow , '' Denisov repeated . 
Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this . 
He slipped in between the officers , came close to Denisov , and said : `` Let me kiss you , dear old fellow ! 
Oh , how fine , how splendid ! '' 
And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut . 
`` Bosse ! 
Vincent ! '' 
Petya cried , stopping outside the door . 
`` Who do you want , sir ? ''
