`` Let us go and have supper , '' he said with a sigh , going to the door . 
They entered the elegant , newly decorated , and luxurious dining room . 
Everything from the table napkins to the silver , china , and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married . 
Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and , with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face , began to talk -- as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out . 
`` Never , never marry , my dear fellow ! 
That 's my advice : never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of , and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is , or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake . 
Marry when you are old and good for nothing -- or all that is good and noble in you will be lost . 
It will all be wasted on trifles . 
Yes ! 
Yes !
