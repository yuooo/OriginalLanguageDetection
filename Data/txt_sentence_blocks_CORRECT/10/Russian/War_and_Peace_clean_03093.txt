Denisov , who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe , now for the first time recognized the old Natasha . 
A flood of brilliant , joyful light poured from her transfigured face . 
`` He 's come ! '' 
she exclaimed as she ran past , and Denisov felt that he too was delighted that Pierre , whom he did not much care for , had returned . 
On reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf . 
`` It 's he ! 
It 's really he ! 
He has come ! '' 
she said to herself , and rushing at him embraced him , pressed his head to her breast , and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy , happy face , covered with hoarfrost . 
`` Yes , it is he , happy and contented ... '' Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight , and the joy that had lit up her face vanished ; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words .
