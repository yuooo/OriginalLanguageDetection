`` What have I come for ? '' 
she began again with nervous haste : `` to embrace your feet , to press your hands like this , till it hurts - you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze them - to tell you again that you are my god , my joy , to tell you that I love you madly , '' she moaned in anguish , and suddenly pressed his hand greedily to her lips . 
Tears streamed from her eyes . 
Alyosha stood speechless and confounded ; he had never expected what he was seeing . 
`` Love is over , Mitya ! '' 
Katya began again , `` But the past is painfully dear to me . 
Know that you will always be so . 
But now let what might have been come true for one minute , '' she faltered , with a drawn smile , looking into his face joyfully again . 
`` You love another woman , and I love another man , and yet I shall love you for ever , and you will love me ; do you know that ? 
Do you hear ?
