That evening the Rostovs went to the Opera , for which Marya Dmitrievna had taken a box . 
Natasha did not want to go , but could not refuse Marya Dmitrievna 's kind offer which was intended expressly for her . 
When she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father , and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty , very pretty , she felt even more sad , but it was a sweet , tender sadness . 
`` O God , if he were here now I would not behave as I did then , but differently . 
I would not be silly and afraid of things , I would simply embrace him , cling to him , and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me , and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh . 
And his eyes -- how I see those eyes ! '' 
thought Natasha . 
`` And what do his father and sister matter to me ? 
I love him alone , him , him , with that face and those eyes , with his smile , manly and yet childlike ... . 
No , I had better not think of him ; not think of him but forget him , quite forget him for the present .
