All was tranquil in the yard . 
Only someone 's orderly passed through the gateway , splashing through the mud , and talked to the innkeeper . 
Above Pierre 's head some pigeons , disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up , fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse . 
The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards , delightful to Pierre at that moment . 
He could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses . 
`` Thank God , there is no more of that ! '' 
he thought , covering up his head again . 
`` Oh , what a terrible thing is fear , and how shamefully I yielded to it ! 
But they ... they were steady and calm all the time , to the end ... '' thought he . 
They , in Pierre 's mind , were the soldiers , those who had been at the battery , those who had given him food , and those who had prayed before the icon .
