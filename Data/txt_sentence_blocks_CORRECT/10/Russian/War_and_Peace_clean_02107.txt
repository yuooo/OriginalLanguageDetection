Boris Drubetskoy , brushing his knees with his hand -LRB- he had probably soiled them when he , too , had knelt before the icon -RRB- , came up to him smiling . 
Boris was elegantly dressed , with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign . 
He wore a long coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder . 
Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house , on a bench which one Cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug . 
An immense and brilliant suite surrounded him . 
The icon was carried further , accompanied by the throng . 
Pierre stopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov , talking to Boris . 
He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position . 
`` This is what you must do , '' said Boris . 
`` I will do the honors of the camp to you .
