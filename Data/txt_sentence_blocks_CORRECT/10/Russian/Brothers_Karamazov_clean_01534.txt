But it 's his doing , his doing ; there 's no doubt about it , he murdered him , that 's as clear as daylight now , '' Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically , repeating himself incoherently , and growing more and more exasperated and excited . 
`` You must understand that , and arrest him at once ... . 
He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious , that 's clear now ... . 
He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal , and without the signal father would never have opened the door ... '' `` But you 're again forgetting the circumstance , '' the prosecutor observed , still speaking with the same restraint , though with a note of triumph , `` that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there , while you were in the garden ... '' `` The door , the door , '' muttered Mitya , and he stared speechless at the prosecutor . 
He sank back helpless in his chair . 
All were silent . 
`` Yes , the door ! 
... It 's a nightmare ! 
God is against me ! '' 
he exclaimed , staring before him in complete stupefaction .
