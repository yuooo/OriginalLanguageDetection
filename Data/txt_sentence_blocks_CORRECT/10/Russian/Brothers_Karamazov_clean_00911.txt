`` As to yesterday , I believe you , but as for to-day , it is difficult to agree with your opinion , '' said he . 
`` Bravo , '' I cried , clapping my hands . 
`` I agree with you there too , I have deserved it ! '' 
`` Will you shoot , sir , or not ? '' 
`` No , I wo n't , '' I said ; `` if you like , fire at me again , but it would be better for you not to fire . '' 
The seconds , especially mine , were shouting too : `` Can you disgrace the regiment like this , facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness ! 
If I 'd only known this ! '' 
I stood facing them all , not laughing now . 
`` Gentlemen , '' I said , `` is it really so wonderful in these days to find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing ? '' 
`` But not in a duel , '' cried my second again .
