She had been in this condition of stupor since the morning , when Sonya , to the surprise and annoyance of the countess , had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew 's wound and of his being with their party . 
The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with Sonya . 
Sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now , as if trying to atone for her fault , paid unceasing attention to her cousin . 
`` Look , Natasha , how dreadfully it is burning ! '' 
said she . 
`` What 's burning ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` Oh , yes , Moscow . '' 
And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her , she turned her face to the window , looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything , and again settled down in her former attitude . 
`` But you did n't see it ! ''
