Vereshchagin with a cry of horror , covering his head with his hands , rushed toward the crowd . 
The tall youth , against whom he stumbled , seized his thin neck with his hands and , yelling wildly , fell with him under the feet of the pressing , struggling crowd . 
Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin , others at the tall youth . 
And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd . 
It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth , beaten almost to death . 
And for a long time , despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun , those who were hitting , throttling , and tearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill him , for the crowd pressed from all sides , swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go . 
`` Hit him with an ax , eh ! 
... Crushed ? 
... Traitor , he sold Christ ... . 
Still alive ... tenacious ... serves him right !
