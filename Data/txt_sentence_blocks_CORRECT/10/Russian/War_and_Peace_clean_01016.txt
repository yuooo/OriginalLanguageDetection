`` Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion ? '' 
`` No , I considered it erroneous and did not follow it , '' said Pierre , so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying . 
`` I have been an atheist , '' answered Pierre . 
`` You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life , therefore you seek wisdom and virtue . 
Is that not so ? '' 
said the Rhetor , after a moment 's pause . 
`` Yes , yes , '' assented Pierre . 
The Rhetor cleared his throat , crossed his gloved hands on his breast , and began to speak . 
`` Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order , '' he said , `` and if this aim coincides with yours , you may enter our Brotherhood with profit . 
The first and chief object of our Order , the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy , is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery ... which has come down to us from the remotest ages , even from the first man -- a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends .
