The first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and that during Napoleon 's occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians , and especially the Russian ladies , then liked so much . 
They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow . 
It was out of the question to be under French rule , it would be the worst thing that could happen . 
They went away even before the battle of Borodino and still more rapidly after it , despite Rostopchin 's calls to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight , or of the balloons that were to destroy the French , and despite all the nonsense Rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets . 
They knew that it was for the army to fight , and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon , and that they must go away , sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction . 
They went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction , for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned . 
They went away each on his own account , and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian people . 
The lady who , afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchin 's orders , had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate , with a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte 's servant , was really , simply , and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia . 
But Count Rostopchin , who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the government offices removed ; now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble ; now had processions displaying the icons , and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints ; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich ; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house ; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage ; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed ; now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him , and now reproached them for doing so ; now expelled all the French residents from Moscow , and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalme -LRB- the center of the whole French colony in Moscow -RRB- to remain , but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense ; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now , to get rid of them , handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate ; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow , and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in the affair -- this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people , to perform some patriotically heroic feat ; and like a child he made sport of the momentous , and unavoidable event -- the abandonment and burning of Moscow -- and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous , popular tide that bore him along with it . 
Helene , having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg , found herself in a difficult position .
