Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt , not the slightest , and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look upon his freak , supposing he were to consider it from any but the commercial point of view . 
Though Mitya knew the merchant by sight , he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him . 
But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate , who was lying at death 's door , would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka 's securing a respectable position , and marrying a man `` to be depended upon . '' 
And he believed not only that he would not object , but that this was what he desired , and , if opportunity arose , that he would be ready to help . 
From some rumour , or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka 's , he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka . 
Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance , and being ready to take his bride , so to speak , from the hands of her protector , Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy . 
I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka 's past as something completely over . 
He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervour of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him , it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri , free from every vice . 
They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh . 
As for Kuzma Samsonov , Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka 's , though she had never loved him , and who was now himself a thing of the past , completely done with , and , so to say , non-existent .
