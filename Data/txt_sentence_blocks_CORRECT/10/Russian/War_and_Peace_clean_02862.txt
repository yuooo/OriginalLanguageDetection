The dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow . 
All around lay the flesh of different animals -- from men to horses -- in various stages of decomposition ; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted . 
It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear , but after a short break it began raining harder than before . 
The saturated road no longer absorbed the water , which ran along the ruts in streams . 
Pierre walked along , looking from side to side , counting his steps in threes , and reckoning them off on his fingers . 
Mentally addressing the rain , he repeated : `` Now then , now then , go on ! 
Pelt harder ! '' 
It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing , but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting . 
This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with Karataev the day before . 
At their yesterday 's halting place , feeling chilly by a dying campfire , Pierre had got up and gone to the next one , which was burning better .
