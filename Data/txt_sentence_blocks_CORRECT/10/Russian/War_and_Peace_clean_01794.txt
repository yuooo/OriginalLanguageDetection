This officer , a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment , was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years before . 
Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done . 
Zdrzhinski , the officer with the long mustache , spoke grandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being `` a Russian Thermopylae , '' and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General Raevski . 
He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him . 
Rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski 's enthusiasm but , on the contrary , looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing , though with no intention of contradicting it . 
Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits , as he himself had done when recounting them ; besides that , he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it . 
And so he did not like Zdrzhinski 's tale , nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who , with his mustaches extending over his cheeks , bent low over the face of his hearer , as was his habit , and crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty . 
Rostov looked at him in silence . 
`` In the first place , there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did lead his sons there , it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him , '' thought he , `` the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam . 
And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it , for what had they to do with Raevski 's tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger ?
