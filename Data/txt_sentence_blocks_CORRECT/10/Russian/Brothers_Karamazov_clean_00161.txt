He had the long , determined stride of a military man . 
He stood still for a moment on the threshold , and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder , guessing him to be their host .

Dmitri kissed his hand respectfully , and with intense feeling , almost anger , he said : `` Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long , but Smerdyakov , the valet sent me by my father , in reply to my inquiries , told me twice over that the appointment was for one .

`` No matter . 
You are a little late . 
It 's of no consequence ... '' `` I 'm extremely obliged to you , and expected no less from your goodness . ''
