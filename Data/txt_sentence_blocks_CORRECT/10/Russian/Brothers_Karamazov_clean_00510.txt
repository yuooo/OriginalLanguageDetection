`` The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove ? '' 
`` There 's the Holy Ghost and there 's the Holy Spirit . 
The Holy Spirit can appear as other birds - sometimes as a swallow , sometimes a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit . '' 
`` How do you know him from an ordinary tit ? '' 
`` He speaks . '' 
`` How does he speak , in what language ? '' 
`` Human language . '' 
`` And what does he tell you ? '' 
`` Why , to-day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me unseemly questions . 
You want to know too much , monk . ''
