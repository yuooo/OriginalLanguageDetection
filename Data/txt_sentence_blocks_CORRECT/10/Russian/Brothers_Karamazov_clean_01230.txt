Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite , and the champagne soon appeared , and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen . 
`` First-class oysters , the last lot in . '' 
`` Hang the oysters . 
I do n't eat them . 
And we do n't need anything , '' cried Pyotr Ilyitch , almost angrily . 
`` There 's no time for oysters , '' said Mitya . 
`` And I 'm not hungry . 
Do you know , friend , '' he said suddenly , with feeling , `` I never have liked all this disorder . '' 
`` Who does like it ? 
Three dozen of champagne for peasants , upon my word , that 's enough to make anyone angry ! ''
