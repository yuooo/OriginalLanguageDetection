As for the prosecutor 's charge of uttering unorthodox opinions , Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from accusations `` damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject . '' 
But at these words the President pulled him up , too , and Fetyukovitch concluded his speech with a bow , amid a hum of approbation in the court . 
And Ippolit Kirillovitch was , in the opinion of our ladies , `` crushed for good . '' 
Then the prisoner was allowed to speak . 
Mitya stood up , but said very little . 
He was fearfully exhausted , physically and mentally . 
The look of strength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had almost disappeared . 
He seemed as though he had passed through an experience that day , which had taught him for the rest of his life something very important he had not understood till then . 
His voice was weak , he did not shout as before . 
In his words there was a new note of humility , defeat and submission .
