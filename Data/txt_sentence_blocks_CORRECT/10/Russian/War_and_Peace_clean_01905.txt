Alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road . 
As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing , but these did not impress him . 
What struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers , evidently for fodder . 
This fact impressed Alpatych , but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it . 
All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince , and he never went beyond that limit . 
Everything not connected with the execution of the prince 's orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych . 
On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper , at the inn kept by Ferapontov , where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years . 
Some thirty years ago Ferapontov , by Alpatych 's advice , had bought a wood from the prince , had begun to trade , and now had a house , an inn , and a corn dealer 's shop in that province . 
He was a stout , dark , red-faced peasant in the forties , with thick lips , a broad knob of a nose , similar knobs over his black frowning brows , and a round belly . 
Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt , Ferapontov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street .
