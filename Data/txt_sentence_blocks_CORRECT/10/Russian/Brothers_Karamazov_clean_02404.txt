No one had expected her . 
Katya moved swiftly to the door , but when she reached Grushenka , she stopped suddenly , turned as white as chalk and moaned softly , almost in a whisper : `` Forgive me ! '' 
Grushenka stared at her and , pausing for an instant , in a vindictive , venomous voice , answered : `` We are full of hatred , my girl , you and I ! 
We are both full of hatred ! 
As though we could forgive one another ! 
Save him , and I 'll worship you all my life . '' 
`` You wo n't forgive her ! '' 
cried Mitya , with frantic reproach . 
`` Do n't be anxious , I 'll save him for you ! '' 
Katya whispered rapidly , and she ran out of the room .
