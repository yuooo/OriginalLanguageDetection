`` We drove them back ! '' 
said Boris with animation , growing talkative . 
`` Can you imagine it ? '' 
and he began describing how the Guards , having taken up their position and seeing troops before them , thought they were Austrians , and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action . 
Rostov without hearing Boris to the end spurred his horse . 
`` Where are you off to ? '' 
asked Boris . 
`` With a message to His Majesty . '' 
`` There he is ! '' 
said Boris , thinking Rostov had said `` His Highness , '' and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards ' jacket , shouting something to a pale , white uniformed Austrian officer .
