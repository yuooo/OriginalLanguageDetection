She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and Nicholas , who had also come to the table . 
`` My God , my God ! 
The same faces , the same talk , Papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way ! '' 
thought Natasha , feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household , because they were always the same .
