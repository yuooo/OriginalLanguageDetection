The fathers and mothers present applauded . 
Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery , where the ladies were sitting . 
Handkerchiefs were waved . 
The President began ringing his bell with all his might . 
He was obviously irritated by the behaviour of the audience , but did not venture to clear the court as he had threatened . 
Even persons of high position , old men with stars on their breasts , sitting on specially reserved seats behind the judges , applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs . 
So that when the noise died down , the President confined himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court , and Fetyukovitch , excited and triumphant , continued his speech . -RRB- 
`` Gentlemen of the jury , you remember that awful night of which so much has been said to-day , when the son got over the fence and stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him . 
I insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to his father 's house : the charge of robbery is an absurdity , as I proved before . 
And it was not to murder him he broke into the house , oh , no !
