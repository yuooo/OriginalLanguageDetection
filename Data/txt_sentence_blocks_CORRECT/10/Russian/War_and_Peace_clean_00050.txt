-- and she left the hall . 
Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and , bending his face close to her , began to whisper something . 
Two footmen , the princess ' and his own , stood holding a shawl and a cloak , waiting for the conversation to finish . 
They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless , with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so . 
The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh . 
`` I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador 's , '' said Prince Hippolyte '' - so dull - . 
It has been a delightful evening , has it not ? 
Delightful ! ''
