`` The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all , is n't it logical ? 
`` This is the first act . 
Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining . 
After the field marshal 's departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle . 
Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority , but General Bennigsen does not quite see it ; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle ` on his own hand ' as the Germans say . 
He does so . 
This is the battle of Pultusk , which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind . 
We civilians , as you know , have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost . 
Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say ; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk . 
In short , we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory , and General Bennigsen , hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory , does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden .
