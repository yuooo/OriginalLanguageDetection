`` When I stood him drinks in the tavern , the man had quite a different face , '' thought Mitya , as he got in . 
At the gates there was a crowd of people , peasants , women , and drivers . 
Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too . 
All stared at Mitya . 
`` Forgive me at parting , good people ! '' 
Mitya shouted suddenly from the cart . 
`` Forgive us too ! '' 
he heard two or three voices . 
`` Good-bye to you , too , Trifon Borissovitch ! ''
