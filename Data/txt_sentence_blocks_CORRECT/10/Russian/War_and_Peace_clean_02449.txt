repeated the officer once more , and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously . 
The gate again hidden by smoke . 
Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate . 
In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead . 
Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall , toward the Znamenka . 
`` Clear that away ! '' 
said the officer , pointing to the beams and the corpses , and the French soldiers , after dispatching the wounded , threw the corpses over the parapet . 
Who these men were nobody knew . 
`` Clear that away ! '' 
was all that was said of them , and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink .
