The angry eldest princess , with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll 's , had come into Pierre 's room after the funeral . 
With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything , except only for permission , after the blow she had received , to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much . 
She could not refrain from weeping at these words . 
Touched that this statuesque princess could so change , Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness , without knowing what for . 
From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him . 
`` Do this for my sake , mon cher ; after all , she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased , '' said Prince Vasili to him , handing him a deed to sign for the princess ' benefit . 
Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone -- a bill for thirty thousand rubles -- to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio . 
Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder . 
The younger sisters also became affectionate to him , especially the youngest , the pretty one with the mole , who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him . 
It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him , and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him , that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him .
