How much ? '' 
`` Very much , '' said Nicholas flushing , and with a stupid careless smile , for which he was long unable to forgive himself , `` I have lost a little , I mean a good deal , a great deal -- forty three thousand . '' 
`` What ! 
To whom ? 
... Nonsense ! '' 
cried the count , suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do . 
`` I promised to pay tomorrow , '' said Nicholas . 
`` Well ! 
... '' said the old count , spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa . 
`` It ca n't be helped It happens to everyone ! ''
