`` But that 's the Grand Duke , and I want the commander in chief or the Emperor , '' said Rostov , and was about to spur his horse . 
`` Count ! 
Count ! '' 
shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Boris . 
`` Count ! 
I am wounded in my right hand '' -LRB- and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it -RRB- `` and I remained at the front . 
I held my sword in my left hand , Count . 
All our family -- the von Bergs -- have been knights ! '' 
He said something more , but Rostov did not wait to hear it and rode away . 
Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space , Rostov , to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged , followed the line of reserves , going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard .
