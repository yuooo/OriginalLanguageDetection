She was a rather tall woman , though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna , who was exceptionally tall . 
She had a full figure , with soft , as it were , noiseless , movements , softened to a peculiar over-sweetness , like her voice . 
She moved , not like Katerina Ivanovna , with a vigorous , bold step , but noiselessly . 
Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor . 
She sank softly into a low chair , softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress , and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl . 
She was twenty-two years old , and her face looked exactly that age . 
She was very white in the face , with a pale pink tint on her cheeks . 
The modelling of her face might be said to be too broad , and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward . 
Her upper lip was thin , but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full , and looked pouting . 
But her magnificent , abundant dark brown hair , her sable-coloured eyebrows and charming greyblue eyes with their long lashes would have made the most indifferent person , meeting her casually in a crowd in the street , stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after .
