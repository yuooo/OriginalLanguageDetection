That sum of money , for which I shall be indebted to your generosity ... Oh , madam , since you are so kind , so touchingly generous to me , '' Mitya exclaimed impulsively , `` then let me reveal to you ... though , of course , you 've known it a long time ... that I love somebody here ... . 
I have been false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say ... . 
Oh , I 've behaved inhumanly , dishonourably to her , but I fell in love here with another woman ... a woman whom you , madam , perhaps , despise , for you know everything already , but whom I can not leave on any account , and therefore that three thousand now - '' `` Leave everything , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Madame Hohlakov interrupted in the most decisive tone . 
`` Leave everything , especially women . 
Gold mines are your goal , and there 's no place for women there . 
Afterwards , when you come back rich and famous , you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society . 
That will be a modern girl , a girl of education and advanced ideas . 
By that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground , and the new woman will have appeared . '' 
`` Madam , that 's not the point , not at all ... . 
Mitya clasped his hands in entreaty .
