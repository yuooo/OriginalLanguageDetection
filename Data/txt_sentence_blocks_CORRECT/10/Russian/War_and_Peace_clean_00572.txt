Prince Vasili sighed . 
`` Yes , yes , my boy . 
And my valet can go in your carriage . 
Ah ! 
I was nearly forgetting , '' he added . 
`` You know , mon cher , your father and I had some accounts to settle , so I have received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it ; you wo n't require it . 
We 'll go into the accounts later . '' 
By `` what was due from the Ryazan estate '' Prince Vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre 's peasants , which the prince had retained for himself . 
In Petersburg , as in Moscow , Pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection . 
He could not refuse the post , or rather the rank -LRB- for he did nothing -RRB- , that Prince Vasili had procured for him , and acquaintances , invitations , and social occupations were so numerous that , even more than in Moscow , he felt a sense of bewilderment , bustle , and continual expectation of some good , always in front of him but never attained .
