He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down , and then got up , saw the door open , went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch . '' 
`` But why , why ? '' 
`` Suffering from aberration . 
When he recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head , he was suffering from aberration : he went and committed the murder . 
As for his saying he did n't , he very likely does n't remember . 
Only , you know , it 'll be better , ever so much better , if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him . 
And that 's how it must have been , though I say it was Grigory .
