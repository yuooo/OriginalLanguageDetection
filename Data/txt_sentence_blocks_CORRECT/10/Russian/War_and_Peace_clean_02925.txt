When the troops reached their night 's halting place on the eighth of November , the last day of the Krasnoe battles , it was already growing dusk . 
All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear . 
Through the falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener . 
An infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place -- a village on the highroad . 
The quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead Frenchmen , cavalrymen , and members of the staff . 
There was only one hut available for the regimental commander . 
The commander rode up to his hut . 
The regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts . 
Like some huge many-limbed animal , the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food . 
One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village , and immediately the sound of axes and swords , the crashing of branches , and merry voices could be heard from there .
