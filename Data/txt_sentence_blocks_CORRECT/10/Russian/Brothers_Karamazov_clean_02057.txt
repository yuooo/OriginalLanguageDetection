`` Hold your tongue , I 'll kick you ! '' 
`` I sha n't be altogether sorry , for then my object will be attained . 
If you kick me , you must believe in my reality , for people do n't kick ghosts . 
Joking apart , it does n't matter to me , scold if you like , though it 's better to be a trifle more polite even to me . 
` Fool , flunkey ! ' 
what words ! '' 
`` Scolding you , I scold myself , '' Ivan laughed again , `` you are myself , myself , only with a different face . 
You just say what I am thinking ... and are incapable of saying anything new ! '' 
`` If I am like you in my way of thinking , it 's all to my credit , '' the gentleman declared , with delicacy and dignity . 
`` You choose out only my worst thoughts , and what 's more , the stupid ones .
