replied Rostov . 
Bagration stopped and , before replying , tried to see Rostov 's face in the mist . 
`` Well , go and see , '' he said , after a pause . 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
Rostov spurred his horse , called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other hussars , told them to follow him , and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came . 
He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him . 
Bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream , but Rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on , continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes . 
Having descended the hill at a trot , he no longer saw either our own or the enemy 's fires , but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly . 
In the valley he saw before him something like a river , but when he reached it he found it was a road . 
Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse , hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside .
