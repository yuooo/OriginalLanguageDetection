In the evening , after supper , when all were about to retire , Anatole kissed Princess Mary 's hand . 
She did not know how she found the courage , but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes . 
Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne 's hand .

Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed , and gave the princess a frightened look . 
`` What delicacy ! '' 
thought the princess . 
`` Is it possible that Amelie '' -LRB- Mademoiselle Bourienne -RRB- `` thinks I could be jealous of her , and not value her pure affection and devotion to me ? ''
