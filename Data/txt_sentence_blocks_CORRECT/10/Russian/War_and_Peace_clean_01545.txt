She had already married off her daughter , and her sons were all in the service . 
She held herself as erect , told everyone her opinion as candidly , loudly , and bluntly as ever , and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness , passion , or temptation -- the possibility of which she did not admit . 
From early in the morning , wearing a dressing jacket , she attended to her household affairs , and then she drove out : on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone . 
On ordinary days , after dressing , she received petitioners of various classes , of whom there were always some . 
Then she had dinner , a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests ; after dinner she played a game of boston , and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted . 
She rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits , and then only to the most important persons in the town . 
She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostovs and their servants . 
Marya Dmitrievna , with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back , stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern , grim face at the new arrivals . 
One might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out , had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings .
