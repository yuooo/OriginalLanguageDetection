The time will come ! '' 
While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess ' room , a carriage containing Pierre -LRB- who had been sent for -RRB- and Anna Mikhaylovna -LRB- who found it necessary to accompany him -RRB- was driving into the court of Count Bezukhov 's house . 
As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows , Anna Mikhaylovna , having turned with words of comfort to her companion , realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up . 
Rousing himself , Pierre followed Anna Mikhaylovna out of the carriage , and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him . 
He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door . 
While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men , who looked like tradespeople , ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall . 
Pausing for a moment , Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides . 
But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman , who could not help seeing these people , took any notice of them . 
`` It seems to be all right , '' Pierre concluded , and followed Anna Mikhaylovna .
