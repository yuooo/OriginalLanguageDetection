He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright . 
`` Listen ; I 've told you I wo n't go away without an answer ! '' 
Ivan cried , intensely irritated . 
`` Why do you keep pestering me ? 
Why do you torment me ? ''

`` Damn it ! 
I 've nothing to do with you . 
Just answer my question and I 'll go away . ''
