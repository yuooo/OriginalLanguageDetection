I soon found a second in a comrade , an ensign of our regiment . 
In those days though duels were severely punished , yet duelling was a kind of fashion among the officers - so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice sometimes be . 
It was the end of June , and our meeting was to take place at seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town - and then something happened that in very truth was the turning point of my life . 
In the evening , returning home in a savage and brutal humour , I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy , and gave him two blows in the face with all my might , so that it was covered with blood . 
He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before , but never with such ferocious cruelty . 
And , believe me , though it 's forty years ago , I recall it now with shame and pain . 
I went to bed and slept for about three hours ; when I waked up the day was breaking . 
I got up - I did not want to sleep any more - I went to the window - opened it , it looked out upon the garden ; I saw the sun rising ; it was warm and beautiful , the birds were singing . 
`` What 's the meaning of it ? '' 
I thought .
