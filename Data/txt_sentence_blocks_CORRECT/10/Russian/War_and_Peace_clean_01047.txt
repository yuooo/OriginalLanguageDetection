He threw the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water . 
The maid brought it . 
There were in the room a child 's cot , two boxes , two armchairs , a table , a child 's table , and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting . 
The curtains were drawn , and a single candle was burning on the table , screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on the cot . 
`` My dear , '' said Princess Mary , addressing her brother from beside the cot where she was standing , `` better wait a bit ... later ... '' `` Oh , leave off , you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off -- and this is what comes of it ! '' 
said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper , evidently meaning to wound his sister . 
`` My dear , really ... it 's better not to wake him ... he 's asleep , '' said the princess in a tone of entreaty . 
Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed , wineglass in hand . 
`` Perhaps we 'd really better not wake him , '' he said hesitating . 
`` As you please ... really ... I think so ... but as you please , '' said Princess Mary , evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed .
