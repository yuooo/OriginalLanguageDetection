Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count 's patriotism , Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her father . 
`` What a darling our Papa is ! '' 
she cried , kissing him , and she again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits . 
`` There ! 
Here 's a patriot for you ! '' 
said Shinshin . 
`` Not a patriot at all , but simply ... '' Natasha replied in an injured tone . 
`` Everything seems funny to you , but this is n't at all a joke ... '' `` A joke indeed ! ''
