On her way past the butler 's pantry she told them to set a samovar , though it was not at all the time for tea . 
Foka , the butler , was the most ill-tempered person in the house . 
Natasha liked to test her power over him . 
He distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted . 
`` Oh dear , what a young lady ! '' 
said Foka , pretending to frown at Natasha . 
No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as Natasha did . 
She could not see people unconcernedly , but had to send them on some errand . 
She seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her ; but the serfs fulfilled no one 's orders so readily as they did hers . 
`` What can I do , where can I go ? ''
