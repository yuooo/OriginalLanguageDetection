`` Captain Ramballe , of the 13th Light Regiment , Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September , '' he introduced himself , a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache . 
`` Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly , instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac 's bullet in my body ? '' 
Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and , blushing , began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it , but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him . 
`` Oh , please ! '' 
said he . 
`` I understand your reasons . 
You are an officer ... a superior officer perhaps . 
You have borne arms against us . 
That 's not my business . 
I owe you my life .
