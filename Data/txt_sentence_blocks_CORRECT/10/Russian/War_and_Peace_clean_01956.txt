The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka . 
Lavrushka , understanding that this was done to perplex him and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened , to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck , opened his eyes wide , and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped . 
`` As soon as Napoleon 's interpreter had spoken , '' says Thiers , `` the Cossack , seized by amazement , did not utter another word , but rode on , his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East . 
All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration . 
Napoleon , after making the Cossack a present , had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields . '' 
Napoleon rode on , dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination , and `` the bird restored to its native fields '' galloped to our outposts , inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades . 
What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling . 
He found the Cossacks , inquired for the regiment operating with Platov 's detachment and by evening found his master , Nicholas Rostov , quartered at Yankovo . 
Rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin ; he let Lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him . 
Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed .
