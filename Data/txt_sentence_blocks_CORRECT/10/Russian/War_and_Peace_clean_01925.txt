Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time , Alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire . 
Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it , and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street , while others carried bundles of hay . 
Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly . 
The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in , the wooden roof was collapsing , and the rafters were alight . 
The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in , and Alpatych watched for it too . 
`` Alpatych ! '' 
a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man . 
`` Mercy on us ! 
Your excellency ! '' 
answered Alpatych , immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince .
