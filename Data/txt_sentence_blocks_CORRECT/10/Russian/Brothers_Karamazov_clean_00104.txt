What was his name ? '' 
`` Alexey , Father . '' 
`` A sweet name . 
After Alexey , the man of God ? ''

I will remember him , mother , and your grief in my prayers , and I will pray for your husband 's health . 
It is a sin for you to leave him . 
Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his father , and will weep over you .
