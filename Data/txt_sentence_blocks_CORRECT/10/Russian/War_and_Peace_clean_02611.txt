Evidently for them `` the marshal '' represented a very high and rather mysterious power . 
These first days , before the eighth of September when the prisoners were had up for a second examination , were the hardest of all for Pierre . 
On the eighth of September an officer -- a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him -- entered the coach house where the prisoners were . 
This officer , probably someone on the staff , was holding a paper in his hand , and called over all the Russians there , naming Pierre as `` the man who does not give his name . '' 
Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners , he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal . 
An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin 's Field . 
It was a fine day , sunny after rain , and the air was unusually pure . 
The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart , but rose through the pure air in columns . 
No flames were seen , but columns of smoke rose on all sides , and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin . 
On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing , and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses .
