Natasha came into the room , went up to Sonya , glanced at what she was doing , and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking . 
`` Why are you wandering about like an outcast ? '' 
asked her mother . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
`` Him ... I want him ... now , this minute ! 
I want him ! '' 
said Natasha , with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile . 
The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter . 
`` Do n't look at me , Mamma ! 
Do n't look ; I shall cry directly . ''
