Do n't worry about him ! 
I do n't want to just now ! '' 
Mitya snapped out , resolutely . 
`` Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with everyone for ? 
... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense ... . 
You 've been fighting and now you 're rushing off on the spree - that 's you all over ! 
Three dozen champagne - what do you want all that for ? '' 
`` Bravo ! 
Now give me the pistols . 
Upon my honour I 've no time now .
