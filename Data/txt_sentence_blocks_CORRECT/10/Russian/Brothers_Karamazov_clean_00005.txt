She had died quite suddenly in a garret , according to one story , of typhus , or as another version had it , of starvation . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife 's death , and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy , raising his hands to Heaven : `` Lord , now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace , '' but others say he wept without restraint like a little child , so much so that people were sorry for him , in spite of the repulsion he inspired .

While he was wearying everyone with his tears and complaints , and turning his house into a sink of debauchery , a faithful servant of the family , Grigory , took the three-year old Mitya into his care .
