By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last . 
He still went on talking , talking incessantly , but quite incoherently , and even articulated his words with difficulty . 
Suddenly he staggered violently ; but Alyosha was in time to support him . 
Ivan let him lead him to his bed . 
Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed . 
He sat watching over him for another two hours . 
The sick man slept soundly , without stirring , breathing softly and evenly . 
Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa , without undressing . 
As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan . 
He began to understand Ivan 's illness .
