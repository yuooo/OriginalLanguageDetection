The troops are in complete disorder ... '' `` You have seen ? 
You have seen ?

`` How ... how dare you ! 
... '' he shouted , choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms : `` How dare you , sir , say that to me ? 
You know nothing about it .

Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder , but Kutuzov interrupted him . 
`` The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank .
