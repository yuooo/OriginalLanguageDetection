Rostov , in dismay , began justifying himself , but seeing the kindly , jocular face of the general , he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair , asking him to intercede for Denisov , whom the general knew . 
Having heard Rostov to the end , the general shook his head gravely . 
`` I 'm sorry , sorry for that fine fellow . 
Give me the letter . '' 
Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining Denisov 's case , when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs , and the general , leaving him , went to the porch . 
The gentlemen of the Emperor 's suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses . 
Hayne , the same groom who had been at Austerlitz , led up the Emperor 's horse , and the faint creak of a footstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs . 
Forgetting the danger of being recognized , Rostov went close to the porch , together with some inquisitive civilians , and again , after two years , saw those features he adored : that same face and same look and step , and the same union of majesty and mildness ... .
