`` That 's very difficult to decide , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what makes a man tell lies , '' observed the prosecutor impressively . 
`` Tell me , though , was that ` amulet , ' as you call it , on your neck , a big thing ? ''

`` How big , for instance ? '' 
`` If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half , that would be the size . '' 
`` You 'd better show us the remains of it . 
You must have them somewhere . '' 
`` Damnation , what nonsense ! 
I do n't know where they are . ''
