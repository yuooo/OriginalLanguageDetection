As soon as Alyosha had gone , Lise unbolted the door , opened it a little , put her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might , pinching her finger . 
Ten seconds after , releasing her finger , she walked softly , slowly to her chair , sat up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail . 
Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering rapidly to herself : `` I am a wretch , wretch , wretch , wretch ! '' 
A Hymn and a Secret IT was quite late -LRB- days are short in November -RRB- when Alyosha rang at the prison gate . 
It was beginning to get dusk . 
But Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty . 
Things were managed in our little town , as everywhere else . 
At first , of course , on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry , relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities . 
But later , though the formalities were not relaxed , exceptions were made for some , at least , of Mitya 's visitors . 
So much so , that sometimes the interviews with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically tete-a-tete .
