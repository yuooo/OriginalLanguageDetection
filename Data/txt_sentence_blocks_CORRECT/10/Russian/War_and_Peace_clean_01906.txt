On seeing Alpatych he went up to him . 
`` You 're welcome , Yakov Alpatych . 
Folks are leaving the town , but you have come to it , '' said he . 
`` Why are they leaving the town ? '' 
asked Alpatych . 
`` That 's what I say . 
Folks are foolish ! 
Always afraid of the French . '' 
`` Women 's fuss , women 's fuss ! '' 
said Alpatych .
