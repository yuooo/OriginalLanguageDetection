When it came to Natasha 's turn to choose a partner , she rose and , tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows , ran timidly to the corner where Denisov sat .

`` Oh no , let me off , Countess , '' Denisov replied . 
`` Now then , Vaska , '' said Nicholas . 
`` They coax me as if I were Vaska the cat ! '' 
said Denisov jokingly .
