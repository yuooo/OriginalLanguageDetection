he asked . 
And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches , he remarked : `` Why such a quantity of churches ? '' 
`` The Russians are very devout , '' replied Balashev . 
`` But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people , '' said Napoleon , turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark . 
Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor . 
`` Every country has its own character , '' said he . 
`` But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that , '' said Napoleon . 
`` I beg your Majesty 's pardon , '' returned Balashev , `` besides Russia there is Spain , where there are also many churches and monasteries . '' 
This reply of Balashev 's , which hinted at the recent defeats of the French in Spain , was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander 's court , but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon 's dinner , where it passed unnoticed . 
The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what Balashev 's tone suggested .
