said Natasha , putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall , stout man in a coachman 's long coat , who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise , and who was passing under the arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small , sallow-faced , beardless old man in a frieze coat . 
`` Yes , it really is Bezukhov in a coachman 's coat , with a queer-looking old boy . 
Really , '' said Natasha , `` look , look ! '' 
`` No , it 's not he . 
How can you talk such nonsense ? '' 
`` Mamma , '' screamed Natasha , `` I 'll stake my head it 's he ! 
I assure you ! 
Stop , stop ! '' 
she cried to the coachman . 
But the coachman could not stop , for from the Meshchanski Street came more carts and carriages , and the Rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way .
