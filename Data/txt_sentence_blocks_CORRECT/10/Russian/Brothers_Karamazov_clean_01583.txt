After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings , Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her , hesitating a little , but preserving the most courteous manner , on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied : `` He was an acquaintance . 
He came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month . '' 
To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness , that , though `` at times '' she had thought him attractive , she had not loved him , but had won his heart as well as his old father 's `` in my nasty spite , '' that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and everyone else ; but that had only amused her . 
She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch , she had simply been laughing at him . 
`` I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month . 
I was expecting another man who had wronged me . 
But I think , '' she said in conclusion , `` that there 's no need for you to inquire about that , nor for me to answer you , for that 's my own affair . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint . 
He again dismissed the `` romantic '' aspect of the case and passed to the serious one , that is , to the question of most importance , concerning the three thousand roubles .
