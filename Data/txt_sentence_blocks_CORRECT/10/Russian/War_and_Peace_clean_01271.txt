But , fortunately for her , she felt her eyes growing misty , she saw nothing clearly , her pulse beat a hundred to the minute , and the blood throbbed at her heart . 
She could not assume that pose , which would have made her ridiculous , and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it . 
And this was the very attitude that became her best . 
Before and behind them other visitors were entering , also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses . 
The mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white , pale-blue , and pink dresses , with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms . 
Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection from the others . 
All was blended into one brilliant procession . 
On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices , footsteps , and greetings deafened Natasha , and the light and glitter dazzled her still more . 
The host and hostess , who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals , `` Charme de vous voir , '' * greeted the Rostovs and Peronskaya in the same manner . 
* `` Delighted to see you . ''
