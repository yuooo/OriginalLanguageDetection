I must let her know . '' 
`` No , no , please not ... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne , '' said the little princess , kissing her . 
`` I know you already through my sister-in-law 's friendship for you .

They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata . 
Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace , as if expecting something unpleasant . 
The little princess entered the room . 
The passage broke off in the middle , a cry was heard , then Princess Mary 's heavy tread and the sound of kissing . 
When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses , who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding , were in each other 's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch .
