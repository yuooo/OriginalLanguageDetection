And if she does go to the old man , can I marry her after that ? 
You understand now why I 'm here in secret and what I 'm on the watch for . '' 
`` For her ? '' 
`` Yes , for her . 
Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here . 
Foma comes from our parts ; he was a soldier in our regiment . 
He does jobs for them . 
He 's watchman at night and goes grouse-shooting in the day-time ; and that 's how he lives . 
I 've established myself in his room . 
Neither he nor the women of the house know the secret - that is , that I am on the watch here . ''
