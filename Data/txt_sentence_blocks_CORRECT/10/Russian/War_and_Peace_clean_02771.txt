That army could not recover anywhere . 
Since the battle of Borodino and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself , as it were , the chemical elements of dissolution . 
The members of what had once been an army -- Napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled -- without knowing whither , each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position , of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious . 
So it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets , when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions , all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier Mouton who , speaking last , said what they all felt : that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible ; and no one , not even Napoleon , could say anything against that truth which they all recognized . 
But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away , there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee . 
An external shock was needed to overcome that shame , and this shock came in due time . 
It was what the French called `` le hourra de l'Empereur . '' 
The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort , on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle . 
Some Cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him . 
If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then , what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the French army , the booty on which the Cossacks fell .
