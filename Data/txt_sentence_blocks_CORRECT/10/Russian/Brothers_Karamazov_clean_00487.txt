He went into Father Zossima 's bedroom , knelt down , and bowed to the ground before the elder , who slept quietly without stirring , with regular , hardly audible breathing and a peaceful face . 
Alyosha returned to the other room , where Father Zossima received his guests in the morning . 
Taking off his boots , he lay down on the hard , narrow , leathern sofa , which he had long used as a bed , bringing nothing but a pillow . 
The mattress , about which his father had shouted to him that morning , he had long forgotten to lie on . 
He took off his cassock , which he used as a covering . 
But before going to bed , he fell on his knees and prayed a long time . 
In his fervent prayer he did not beseech God to lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion , which always visited his soul after the praise and adoration , of which his evening prayer usually consisted . 
That joy always brought him light untroubled sleep . 
As he was praying , he suddenly felt in his pocket the little pink note the servant had handed him as he left Katerina Ivanovna 's . 
He was disturbed , but finished his prayer .
