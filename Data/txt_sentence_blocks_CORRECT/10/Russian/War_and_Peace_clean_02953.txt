Chichagov , one of the most zealous `` cutters-off '' and `` breakers-up , '' who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent : Chichagov , noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the Emperor , and who considered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutuzov , and found that peace had already been concluded , he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really Kutuzov 's ; this Chichagov was the first to meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay . 
In undress naval uniform , with a dirk , and holding his cap under his arm , he handed Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town . 
The contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichagov , who knew of the accusations that were being directed against Kutuzov . 
When speaking to Chichagov , Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him . 
`` You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of ... . 
On the contrary , I can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties , '' warmly replied Chichagov , who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov to be animated by the same desire . 
Kutuzov , shrugging his shoulders , replied with his subtle penetrating smile : `` I meant merely to say what I said . '' 
Contrary to the Emperor 's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at Vilna . 
Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town . 
He attended to army affairs reluctantly , left everything to his generals , and while awaiting the Emperor 's arrival led a dissipated life .
