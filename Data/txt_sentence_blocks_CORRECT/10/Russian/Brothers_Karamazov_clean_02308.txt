That 's not his character , he tells us , he could n't have had such feelings . 
But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature ; he cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once . 
Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature , fluctuating between two extremes , that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gaiety , he can pull himself up , if something strikes him on the other side . 
And on the other side is love that new love which had flamed up in his heart , and for that love he needed money ; oh , far more than for carousing with his mistress . 
If she were to say to him , ' I am yours , I wo n't have Fyodor Pavlovitch , ' then he must have money to take her away . 
That was more important than carousing . 
Could a Karamazov fail to understand it ? 
That anxiety was just what he was suffering from - what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency ? 
`` But time passed , and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand ; on the contrary , the latter heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he , the prisoner , loved . 
` If Fyodor Pavlovitch does n't give the money , ' he thought , ' I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna . '
