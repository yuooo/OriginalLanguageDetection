But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before . 
If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him , but Alyosha was silent and `` it might be the silence of contempt , '' and that finally irritated Kolya . 
`` The classical languages , too ... they are simply madness , nothing more . 
You seem to disagree with me again , Karamazov ? '' 
`` I do n't agree , '' said Alyosha , with a faint smile . 
`` The study of the classics , if you ask my opinion , is simply a police measure , that 's simply why it has been introduced into our schools . '' 
By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again . 
`` Latin and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect . 
It was dull before , so what could they do to make things duller ? 
It was senseless enough before , so what could they do to make it more senseless ?
