`` European Liberals in general , and even our liberal dilettanti , often mix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity . 
This wild notion is , of course , a characteristic feature . 
But it 's not only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity , but , in many cases , it appears , the police - the foreign police , of course - do the same . 
Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point , Pyotr Alexandrovitch . '' 
`` I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether , '' Miusov repeated .
