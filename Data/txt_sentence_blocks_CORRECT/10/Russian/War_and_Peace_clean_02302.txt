`` The count had a sty , '' replied the adjutant smiling , `` and was very much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him . 
By the by , Count , '' he added suddenly , addressing Pierre with a smile , `` we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess , your wife ... '' `` I have heard nothing , '' Pierre replied unconcernedly . 
`` But what have you heard ? '' 
`` Oh , well , you know people often invent things . 
I only say what I heard . '' 
`` But what did you hear ? '' 
`` Well , they say , '' continued the adjutant with the same smile , `` that the countess , your wife , is preparing to go abroad . 
I expect it 's nonsense ... '' `` Possibly , '' remarked Pierre , looking about him absent-mindedly . 
`` And who is that ? ''
