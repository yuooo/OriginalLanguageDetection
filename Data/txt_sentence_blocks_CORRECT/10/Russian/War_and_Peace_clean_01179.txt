They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before . 
They went through the muddy village , past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye , downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge , uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain , past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there , and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road . 
In the forest it was almost hot , no wind could be felt . 
The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless , and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year 's leaves . 
The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter . 
On entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly . 
Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman ; the latter assented . 
But apparently the coachman 's sympathy was not enough for Peter , and he turned on the box toward his master . 
`` How pleasant it is , your excellency ! '' 
he said with a respectful smile .
