Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village . 
`` He 's coming ! 
He 's coming ! '' 
shouted a Cossack standing at the gate . 
Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate , at which a knot of soldiers -LRB- a guard of honor -RRB- was standing , and they saw Kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse . 
A huge suite of generals rode behind him . 
Barclay was riding almost beside him , and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting , `` Hurrah ! '' 
His adjutants galloped into the yard before him . 
Kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse , which ambled smoothly under his weight , and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard 's cap with a red band and no peak , nodding his head continually . 
When he came up to the guard of honor , a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations , who were giving him the salute , he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him .
