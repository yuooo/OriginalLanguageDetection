On reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves , he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand . 
Denisov and Petya rode up to him . 
From the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the French . 
Immediately beyond the forest , on a downward slope , lay a field of spring rye . 
To the right , beyond a steep ravine , was a small village and a landowner 's house with a broken roof . 
In the village , in the house , in the garden , by the well , by the pond , over all the rising ground , and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village , not more than five hundred yards away , crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist . 
Their un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts , and their calls to one another , could be clearly heard . 
`` Bwing the prisoner here , '' said Denisov in a low voice , not taking his eyes off the French . 
A Cossack dismounted , lifted the boy down , and took him to Denisov . 
Pointing to the French troops , Denisov asked him what these and those of them were .
