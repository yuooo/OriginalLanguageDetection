Killing people ! 
Poor dear , he 's as white as a sheet ! '' 
-- various voices were heard saying . 
Petya soon came to himself , the color returned to his face , the pain had passed , and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be returning that way . 
Petya no longer thought of presenting his petition . 
If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy ! 
While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption - it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor 's arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the Turks -- the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared , selling kvas , gingerbread , and poppyseed sweets -LRB- of which Petya was particularly fond -RRB- , and ordinary conversation could again be heard . 
A tradesman 's wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost ; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear . 
The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop . 
The clerk several times used the word `` plenary '' -LRB- of the service -RRB- , a word Petya did not understand .
