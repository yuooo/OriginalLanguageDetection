But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy . 
Princess Mary , in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew , was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight . 
She received letters from her relations to which she had to reply ; the room in which little Nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough ; Alpatych came to Yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvizhenka Street , which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs . 
Life did not stand still and it was necessary to live . 
Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then , and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natasha alone , yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them . 
She went through the accounts with Alpatych , conferred with Dessalles about her nephew , and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to Moscow . 
Natasha remained alone and , from the time Princess Mary began making preparations for departure , held aloof from her too . 
Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her to Moscow , and both parents gladly accepted this offer , for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her . 
`` I am not going anywhere , '' Natasha replied when this was proposed to her . 
`` Do please just leave me alone ! ''
