Secondly , the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be far off , that not till next morning , at least , they would come and take him . 
So he had a few hours and that 's much , very much ! 
In a few hours one can think of many things . 
I imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they are being taken to the scaffold . 
They have another long , long street to pass down and at walking pace , past thousands of people . 
Then there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street the dread place of execution ! 
I fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man , sitting on his shameful cart , must feel that he has infinite life still before him . 
The houses recede , the cart moves on - oh , that 's nothing , it 's still far to the turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes fixed on him , and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they . 
But now the turning comes to the next street . 
Oh , that 's nothing , nothing , there 's still a whole street before him , and however many houses have been passed , he will still think there are many left .
