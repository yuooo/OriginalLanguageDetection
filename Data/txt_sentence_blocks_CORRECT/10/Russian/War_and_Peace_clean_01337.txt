Prince Andrew held her hands , looked into her eyes , and did not find in his heart his former love for her . 
Something in him had suddenly changed ; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire , but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness , fear at her devotion and trustfulness , and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever . 
The present feeling , though not so bright and poetic as the former , was stronger and more serious . 
`` Did your mother tell you that it can not be for a year ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew , still looking into her eyes . 
`` Is it possible that I -- the ` chit of a girl , ' as everybody called me , '' thought Natasha -- `` is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange , dear , clever man whom even my father looks up to ? 
Can it be true ? 
Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life , that now I am grown up , that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed ? 
Yes , but what did he ask me ? '' 
`` No , '' she replied , but she had not understood his question .
