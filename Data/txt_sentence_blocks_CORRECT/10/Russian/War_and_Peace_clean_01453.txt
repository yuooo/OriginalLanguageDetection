she said , and jumping off his back she went downstairs . 
Having as it were reviewed her kingdom , tested her power , and made sure that everyone was submissive , but that all the same it was dull , Natasha betook herself to the ballroom , picked up her guitar , sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase , and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass , picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew . 
What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners , but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds . 
She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered . 
She was in a mood for brooding on the past . 
Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand . 
Natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door , and it seemed to her that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand . 
`` Yes it was exactly the same , '' thought Natasha . 
`` Sonya , what is this ? '' 
she cried , twanging a thick string .
