The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections ; he had to get something to eat before going away . 
He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning . 
There he found so many people , among them officers who , like himself , had come in civilian clothes , that he had difficulty in getting a dinner . 
Two officers of his own division joined him . 
The conversation naturally turned on the peace . 
The officers , his comrades , like most of the army , were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland . 
They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for , as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition . 
Nicholas ate and drank -LRB- chiefly the latter -RRB- in silence . 
He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself . 
The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion .
