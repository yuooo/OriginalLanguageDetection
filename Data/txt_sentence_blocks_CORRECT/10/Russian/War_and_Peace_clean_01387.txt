`` If you scare away the beast , Daniel 'll give it you ! '' 
`` I know a thing or two myself ! '' 
said Nastasya Ivanovna . 
`` Hush ! '' 
whispered the count and turned to Simon . 
`` Have you seen the young countess ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` With young Count Peter , by the Zharov rank grass , '' answered Simon , smiling . 
`` Though she 's a lady , she 's very fond of hunting . ''
