Why , the three thousand which means a career for him . 
Oh , I am not contradicting myself - the money may have existed . 
And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to find it , where his master kept it . 
And the covering of the money - the torn envelope on the floor ? 
`` Just now , when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the floor , and not one like Smerdyakov , who would have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself , I thought as I listened that I was hearing something very familiar , and , would you believe it , I have heard that very argument , that very conjecture , of how Karamazov would have behaved , precisely two days before , from Smerdyakov himself . 
What 's more , it struck me at the time . 
I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him ; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy it was my own . 
He insinuated it , as it were . 
Did he not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor ? 
`` I shall be asked , ` What about the old woman , Grigory 's wife ?
