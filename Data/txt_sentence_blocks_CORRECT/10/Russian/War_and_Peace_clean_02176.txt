Pierre wished to be there with that smoke , those shining bayonets , that movement , and those sounds . 
He turned to look at Kutuzov and his suite , to compare his impressions with those of others . 
They were all looking at the field of battle as he was , and , as it seemed to him , with the same feelings . 
All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew . 
`` Go , my dear fellow , go ... and Christ be with you ! '' 
Kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him , not taking his eye from the battlefield . 
Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down the knoll . 
`` To the crossing ! '' 
said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going . 
`` I 'll go there too , I too ! ''
