`` You can speak , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch assented . 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ! '' 
Mitya got up from his chair , `` have faith in God and in me . 
I am not guilty of my father 's murder ! '' 
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair . 
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon . 
`` Thanks be to Thee , O Lord , '' she said , in a voice thrilled with emotion , and still standing , she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added : `` As he has spoken now , believe it ! 
I know him . 
He 'll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy , but he 'll never deceive you against his conscience . 
He 's telling the whole truth , you may believe it . ''
