he asked , indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat , with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face . 
`` He ? 
That 's a tradesman , that is to say , he 's the restaurant keeper , Vereshchagin . 
Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation . '' 
`` Oh , so that is Vereshchagin ! '' 
said Pierre , looking at the firm , calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor . 
`` That 's not he himself , that 's the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation , '' said the adjutant . 
`` The young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him . '' 
An old gentleman wearing a star and another official , a German wearing a cross round his neck , approached the speaker . 
`` It 's a complicated story , you know , '' said the adjutant .
