`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before .
