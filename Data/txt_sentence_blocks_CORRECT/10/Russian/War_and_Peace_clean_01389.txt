He understands the matter so well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded , '' said Simon , well knowing what would please his master . 
`` Rides well , eh ? 
And how well he looks on his horse , eh ? '' 
`` A perfect picture ! 
How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the Zavarzinsk thicket the other day ! 
Leaped a fearful place ; what a sight when they rushed from the covert ... the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price ! 
Yes , one would have to search far to find another as smart . '' 
`` To search far ... '' repeated the count , evidently sorry Simon had not said more . 
`` To search far , '' he said , turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox .
