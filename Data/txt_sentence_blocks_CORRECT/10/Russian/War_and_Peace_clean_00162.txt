The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking . 
He neither smoked nor talked , but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors , whom he egged on against each other . 
One of them was a sallow , clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face , already growing old , though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man . 
He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and , having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth , was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes . 
This was an old bachelor , Shinshin , a cousin of the countess ' , a man with `` a sharp tongue '' as they said in Moscow society . 
He seemed to be condescending to his companion . 
The latter , a fresh , rosy officer of the Guards , irreproachably washed , brushed , and buttoned , held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke , letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings . 
This was Lieutenant Berg , an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom Boris was to travel to join the army , and about whom Natasha had , teased her elder sister Vera , speaking of Berg as her `` intended . '' 
The count sat between them and listened attentively . 
His favorite occupation when not playing boston , a card game he was very fond of , was that of listener , especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another .
