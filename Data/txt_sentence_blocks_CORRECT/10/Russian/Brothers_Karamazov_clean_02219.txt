He was overpowered . 
Yes , I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been satisfied - the show had been a varied one . 
Then I remember the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene . 
I believe the President had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan . 
The doctor announced to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever , and that he must be at once removed . 
In answer to questions from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence he said that the patient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on , but he had not consented to be looked after . 
`` He was certainly not in a normal state of mind : he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake , that he met several persons in the street , who were dead , and that Satan visited him every evening , '' said the doctor , in conclusion . 
Having given his evidence , the celebrated doctor withdrew . 
The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material proofs . 
After some deliberation , the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence -LRB- given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna -RRB- on the protocol .
