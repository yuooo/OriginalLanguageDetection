He had , in any case , to make haste . 
The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small , temporary loan of money . 
The nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition . 
And , as we all know , one ca n't take a step without money . 
But he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan . 
He had a brace of fine duelling pistols in a case , which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions . 
In the Metropolis tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons . 
He used to buy pistols , revolvers , daggers , hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances . 
He prided himself on them , and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver . 
Mitya , without stopping to think , went straight to him , and offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten roubles .
