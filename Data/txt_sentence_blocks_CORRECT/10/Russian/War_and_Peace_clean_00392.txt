He just sends a ball and they think they 'll all be killed , '' a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully . 
`` As it flies past me , Daddy , the ball I mean , '' said a young soldier with an enormous mouth , hardly refraining from laughing , `` I felt like dying of fright . 
I did , ` pon my word , I got that frightened ! '' 
said he , as if bragging of having been frightened . 
That one also passed . 
Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before . 
It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German , and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects . 
A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind . 
A woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman , and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds . 
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission .
