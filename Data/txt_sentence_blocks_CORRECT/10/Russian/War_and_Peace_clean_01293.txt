Before Magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier . 
Most of the anecdotes , if not relating to the state service , related to people in the service . 
It seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule . 
Speranski related how at the Council that morning a deaf dignitary , when asked his opinion , replied that he thought so too . 
Gervais gave a long account of an official revision , remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned . 
Stolypin , stuttering , broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things -- threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation . 
Magnitski starting quizzing Stolypin about his vehemence . 
Gervais intervened with a joke , and the talk reverted to its former lively tone . 
Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends , and his guests , understanding his wish , tried to enliven him and amuse themselves . 
But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome .
