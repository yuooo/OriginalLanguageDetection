One told how he had taken a life , another had taken two , a third had set a house on fire , while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing . 
So they asked the old man : ` What are you being punished for , Daddy ? ' 
-- ` I , my dear brothers , ' said he , ` am being punished for my own and other men 's sins . 
But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine , but have only helped my poorer brothers . 
I was a merchant , my dear brothers , and had much property . 
` And he went on to tell them all about it in due order . ' 
I do n't grieve for myself , ' he says , ` God , it seems , has chastened me . 
Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children , ' and the old man began to weep . 
Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant . 
` Where did it happen , Daddy ? '
