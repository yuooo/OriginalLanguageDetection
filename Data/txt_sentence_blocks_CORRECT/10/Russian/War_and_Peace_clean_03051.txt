`` I expected nothing else , '' she told herself , calling her pride to her aid . 
`` I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the old lady , who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many obligations . '' 
But she could not pacify herself with these reflections ; a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit . 
Though she had firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole matter , she felt herself all the time in an awkward position . 
And when she asked herself what distressed her , she had to admit that it was her relation to Rostov . 
His cold , polite manner did not express his feeling for her -LRB- she knew that -RRB- but it concealed something , and until she could discover what that something was , she felt that she could not be at ease . 
One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her nephew 's lessons , she was informed that Rostov had called . 
With a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation , she sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room . 
Her first glance at Nicholas ' face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness , and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her . 
They spoke of the countess ' health , of their mutual friends , of the latest war news , and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise , Nicholas got up to say good-by .
