`` Stop , you rascals ! '' 
`` But how are you going to stop them ? '' 
replied another officer . 
`` There is no getting them together . 
The army should push on before the rest bolt , that 's all ! '' 
`` How can one push on ? 
They are stuck there , wedged on the bridge , and do n't move . 
Should n't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away ? '' 
`` Come , go in there and drive them out ! '' 
shouted the senior officer .
