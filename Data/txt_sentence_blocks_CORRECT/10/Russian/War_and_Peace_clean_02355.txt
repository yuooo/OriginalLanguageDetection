The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses , from which wounded men began to come into the Rostovs ' yard . 
Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things . 
But the work of unloading , once started , could not be arrested . 
It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind . 
Cases full of china , bronzes , pictures , and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard , and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart . 
`` We can take four more men , '' said the steward . 
`` They can have my trap , or else what is to become of them ? '' 
`` Let them have my wardrobe cart , '' said the countess . 
`` Dunyasha can go with me in the carriage . '' 
They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off .
