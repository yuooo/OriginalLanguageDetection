`` You know , you see right through people . 
Anatole is no genius , but he is an honest , goodhearted lad ; an excellent son or kinsman . '' 
`` All right , all right , we 'll see ! '' 
As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society , on Anatole 's appearance all the three women of Prince Bolkonski 's household felt that their life had not been real till then . 
Their powers of reasoning , feeling , and observing immediately increased tenfold , and their life , which seemed to have been passed in darkness , was suddenly lit up by a new brightness , full of significance . 
Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure . 
The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention . 
He seemed to her kind , brave , determined , manly , and magnanimous . 
She felt convinced of that . 
Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination .
