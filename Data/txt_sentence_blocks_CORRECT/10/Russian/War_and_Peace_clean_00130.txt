Would you believe it , I have literally not a penny and do n't know how to equip Boris . '' 
She took out her handkerchief and began to cry . 
`` I need five hundred rubles , and have only one twenty-five-ruble note . 
I am in such a state ... . 
My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov . 
If he will not assist his godson -- you know he is Bory 's godfather -- and allow him something for his maintenance , all my trouble will have been thrown away ... . 
I shall not be able to equip him . '' 
The countess ' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence . 
`` I often think , though , perhaps it 's a sin , '' said the princess , `` that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich , all alone ... that tremendous fortune ... and what is his life worth ? 
It 's a burden to him , and Bory 's life is only just beginning ... '' `` Surely he will leave something to Boris , '' said the countess .
