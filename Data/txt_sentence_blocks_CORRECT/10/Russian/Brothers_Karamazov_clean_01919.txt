Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha , and he felt something like a stab at his heart . 
`` Hush ! 
What do you mean ? '' 
he faltered helplessly . 
`` The whole truth , the whole , do n't lie ! '' 
repeated Mitya . 
`` I 've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer ! '' 
broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha 's breast , and he raised his right hand in the air , as though calling God to witness his words . 
Mitya 's whole face was lighted up with bliss . 
`` Thank you ! ''
