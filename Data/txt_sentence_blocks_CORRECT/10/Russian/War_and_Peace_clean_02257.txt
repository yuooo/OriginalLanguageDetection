A great crowd of generals gathered round him , and Count Rostopchin , who had come out from Moscow , joined them . 
This brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position , the state of the army , the plans suggested , the situation of Moscow , and military questions generally . 
Though they had not been summoned for the purpose , and though it was not so called , they all felt that this was really a council of war . 
The conversations all dealt with public questions . 
If anyone gave or asked for personal news , it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters . 
No jokes , or laughter , or smiles even , were seen among all these men . 
They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded . 
And all these groups , while talking among themselves , tried to keep near the commander in chief -LRB- whose bench formed the center of the gathering -RRB- and to speak so that he might overhear them . 
The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks , but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion . 
After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment , as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear .
