At last she announced that she was going to dance , too . 
She got up from her chair , staggering . 
`` Mitya , do n't give me any more wine - if I ask you , do n't give it to me . 
Wine does n't give peace . 
Everything 's going round , the stove , and everything . 
I want to dance . 
Let everyone see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I dance ... '' She really meant it . 
She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her pocket , and took it by one corner in her right hand , to wave it in the dance . 
Mitya ran to and fro , the girls were quiet , and got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal . 
Maximov , hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance , squealed with delight , and ran skipping about in front of her , humming : With legs so slim and sides so trim And its little tail curled tight .
