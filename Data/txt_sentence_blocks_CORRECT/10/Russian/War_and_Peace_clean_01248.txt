He did not stay more than ten minutes , then rose and took his leave . 
The same inquisitive , challenging , and rather mocking eyes still looked at him . 
After his first visit Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much as ever , but that he must not yield to that feeling , because to marry her , a girl almost without fortune , would mean ruin to his career , while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable . 
Boris made up his mind to avoid meeting Natasha , but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostovs ' . 
It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten , that in spite of everything ... she could not be his wife , that he had no means , and they would never let her marry him . 
But he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation . 
From day to day he became more and more entangled . 
It seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love with Boris as of old . 
She sang him his favorite songs , showed him her album , making him write in it , did not allow him to allude to the past , letting it be understood how was the present ; and every day he went away in a fog , without having said what he meant to , and not knowing what he was doing or why he came , or how it would all end . 
He left off visiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her every day , and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs .
