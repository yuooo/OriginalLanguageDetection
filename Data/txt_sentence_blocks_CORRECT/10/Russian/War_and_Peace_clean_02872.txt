Two French soldiers ran past Pierre , one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun . 
They both looked pale , and in the expression on their faces -- one of them glanced timidly at Pierre -- there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution . 
Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that , two days before , that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him . 
Behind him , where Karataev had been sitting , the dog began to howl . 
`` What a stupid beast ! 
Why is it howling ? '' 
thought Pierre . 
His comrades , the prisoner soldiers walking beside him , avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling , just as Pierre did , but there was a set look on all their faces . 
The stores , the prisoners , and the marshal 's baggage train stopped at the village of Shamshevo .
