These were troops of Beauharnais ' corps which had started before any of the others . 
Behind , along the riverside and across the Stone Bridge , were Ney 's troops and transport . 
Davout 's troops , in whose charge were the prisoners , were crossing the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga road . 
But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais ' train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kaluga road when the vanguard of Ney 's army was already emerging from the Great Ordynka Street . 
When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward , halted , and again moved on , and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together . 
They advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road , taking more than an hour to do so , and came out upon the square where the streets of the Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge , and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway . 
From all sides , like the roar of the sea , were heard the rattle of wheels , the tramp of feet , and incessant shouts of anger and abuse . 
Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house , listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums . 
To get a better view , several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning . 
`` What crowds !
