After going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of Tuchkov 's corps were stationed to defend the left flank . 
Here , at the extreme left flank , Bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat , and , as it seemed to Pierre , gave orders of great military importance . 
In front of Tuchkov 's troops was some high ground not occupied by troops . 
Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake , saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it . 
Some of the generals expressed the same opinion . 
One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered . 
Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground . 
This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre 's doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters . 
Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill , he quite understood them and shared their opinion , but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder . 
Pierre did not know that these troops were not , as Bennigsen supposed , put there to defend the position , but were in a concealed position as an ambush , that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly .
