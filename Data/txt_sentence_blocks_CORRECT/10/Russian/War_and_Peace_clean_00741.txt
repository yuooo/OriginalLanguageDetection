`` Oh , go to the devil ! '' 
called out a voice , drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants . 
`` All the same , I love and value nothing but triumph over them all , I value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist ! '' 
That same night , Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagration 's detachment . 
His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him . 
An enormous space , with our army 's campfires dimly glowing in the fog , could be seen behind him ; in front of him was misty darkness . 
Rostov could see nothing , peer as he would into that foggy distance : now something gleamed gray , now there was something black , now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be , now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes . 
His eyes kept closing , and in his fancy appeared -- now the Emperor , now Denisov , and now Moscow memories -- and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding , and sometimes , when he came within six paces of them , the black figures of hussars , but in the distance was still the same misty darkness . 
`` Why not ? 
... It might easily happen , '' thought Rostov , `` that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer ; he 'll say : ` Go and find out what 's there . '
