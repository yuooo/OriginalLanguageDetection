The princess blushed , and raised her arms with a gesture of despair . 
`` No , Andrew , I must say you have changed . 
Oh , how you have ... '' `` Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` You had better go . '' 
The princess said nothing , but suddenly her short downy lip quivered . 
Prince Andrew rose , shrugged his shoulders , and walked about the room . 
Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise , now at him and now at her , moved as if about to rise too , but changed his mind . 
`` Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here ? '' 
exclaimed the little princess suddenly , her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace .
