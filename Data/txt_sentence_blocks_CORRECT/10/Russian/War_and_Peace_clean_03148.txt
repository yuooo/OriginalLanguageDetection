Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski 's bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual .

Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring . 
Little Nicholas , who had just waked up in a cold perspiration , sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes . 
He had awaked from a terrible dream . 
He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre , wearing helmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch , were leading a huge army . 
The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vierge . 
In front was Glory , which was similar to those threads but rather thicker . 
He and Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously , nearer and nearer to their goal . 
Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move .
