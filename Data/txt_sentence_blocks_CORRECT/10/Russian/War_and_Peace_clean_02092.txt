He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces , but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service , who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat . 
Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him . 
This was one of the head army doctors . 
He was driving toward Pierre in a covered gig , sitting beside a young surgeon , and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver 's seat to pull up . 
`` Count ! 
Your excellency , how come you to be here ? '' 
asked the doctor . 
`` Well , you know , I wanted to see ... '' `` Yes , yes , there will be something to see ... '' Pierre got out and talked to the doctor , explaining his intention of taking part in a battle . 
The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov . 
`` Why should you be God knows where out of sight , during the battle ? ''
