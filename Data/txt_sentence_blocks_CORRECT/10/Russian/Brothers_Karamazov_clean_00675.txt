I have been thinking it over . 
In the first place , you 've known me from a child and you 've a great many qualities I have n't . 
You are more light-hearted than I am ; above all , you are more innocent than I am . 
I have been brought into contact with many , many things already ... . 
Ah , you do n't know , but I , too , am a Karamazov . 
What does it matter if you do laugh and make jokes , and at me , too ? 
Go on laughing . 
I am so glad you do . 
You laugh like a little child , but you think like a martyr . '' 
`` Like a martyr ?
