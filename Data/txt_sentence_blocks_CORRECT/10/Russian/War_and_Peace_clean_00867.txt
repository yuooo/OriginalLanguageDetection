Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration -LRB- or he would , it seemed , have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it -RRB- and drew his attention to the verses . 
`` Well , I will read them , then ! '' 
Bagration seemed to say , and , fixing his weary eyes on the paper , began to read them with a fixed and serious expression . 
But the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud . 
Bagration bowed his bead and listened : Bring glory then to Alexander 's reign And on the throne our Titus shield . 
A dreaded foe be thou , kindhearted as a man , A Rhipheus at home , a Caesar in the field ! 
E'en fortunate Napoleon Knows by experience , now , Bagration , And dare not Herculean Russians trouble ... But before he had finished reading , a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner was ready ! 
The door opened , and from the dining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise : Conquest 's joyful thunder waken , Triumph , valiant Russians , now ! 
... and Count Rostov , glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his verses , bowed to Bagration . 
Everyone rose , feeling that dinner was more important than verses , and Bagration , again preceding all the rest , went in to dinner .
