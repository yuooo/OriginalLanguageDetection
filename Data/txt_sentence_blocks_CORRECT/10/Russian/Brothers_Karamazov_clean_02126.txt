Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province , but from several other Russian towns , as well as from Moscow and Petersburg . 
Among them were lawyers , ladies , and even several distinguished personages . 
Every ticket of admission had been snatched up . 
A special place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important of the men visitors ; a row of arm-chairs had been placed there - something exceptional , which had never been allowed before . 
A large proportion not less than half of the public - were ladies . 
There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not know where to seat them , for every ticket had long since been eagerly sought for and distributed . 
I saw at the end of the room , behind the platform , a special partition hurriedly put up , behind which all these lawyers were admitted , and they thought themselves lucky to have standing room there , for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space , and the crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed , shoulder to shoulder . 
Some of the ladies , especially those who came from a distance , made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed , but the majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress . 
Their faces betrayed hysterical , intense , almost morbid , curiosity . 
A peculiar fact - established afterwards by many observations - was that almost all the ladies , or , at least the vast majority of them , were on Mitya 's side and in favour of his being acquitted .
