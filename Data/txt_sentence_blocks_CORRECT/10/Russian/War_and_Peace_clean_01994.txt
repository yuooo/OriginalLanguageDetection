`` I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy . 
Dear friend , I can do nothing . 
I understand nothing . 
I have nobody ! 
I want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning . '' 
Dron paused . 
He looked askance at Princess Mary and said : `` There are no horses ; I told Yakov Alpatych so . '' 
`` Why are there none ? '' 
asked the princess .
