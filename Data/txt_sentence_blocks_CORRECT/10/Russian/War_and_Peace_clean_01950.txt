The `` man of great merit , '' who was still a novice in court circles , wishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending her former position on this question , observed : `` It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov those powers . 
They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read , when he said to Kutuzov : ` Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor . ' '' 
`` Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech , '' said Anna Pavlovna . 
`` Oh , no , no ! '' 
warmly rejoined Prince Vasili , who would not now yield Kutuzov to anyone ; in his opinion Kutuzov was not only admirable himself , but was adored by everybody . 
`` No , that 's impossible , '' said he , `` for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before . '' 
`` God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel , '' observed Anna Pavlovna . 
Understanding at once to whom she alluded , Prince Vasili said in a whisper : `` I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the Tsarevich should not be with the army .
