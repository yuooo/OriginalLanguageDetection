His leave was expiring . 
He spent every day and whole days at the Karagins ' , and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow . 
But in Julie 's presence , looking at her red face and chin -LRB- nearly always powdered -RRB- , her moist eyes , and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss , Boris could not utter the decisive words , though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them . 
Julie saw Boris ' indecision , and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him , but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation , and she told herself that he was only shy from love . 
Her melancholy , however , began to turn to irritability , and not long before Boris ' departure she formed a definite plan of action . 
Just as Boris ' leave of absence was expiring , Anatole Kuragin made his appearance in Moscow , and of course in the Karagins ' drawing room , and Julie , suddenly abandoning her melancholy , became cheerful and very attentive to Kuragin . 
`` My dear , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son , `` I know from a reliable source that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him married to Julie . 
I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her . 
What do you think of it , my dear ? '' 
The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie , and of seeing all the revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another , and especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole , pained Boris .
