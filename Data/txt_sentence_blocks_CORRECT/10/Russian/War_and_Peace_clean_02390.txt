The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the Stone , Moskva , and Yauza bridges . 
While the troops , dividing into two parts when passing around the Kremlin , were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges , a great many soldiers , taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion , turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski gate , back up the hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them . 
Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar . 
But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter ; there were no hawkers , nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers -- but only soldiers , in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets , entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles . 
Tradesmen and their assistants -LRB- of whom there were but few -RRB- moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered .

On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call .
