And so he instantly flew to one frantic plan , which , to a man of Karamazov 's character , must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his terrible position . 
That way out was suicide . 
He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his friend Perhotin and on the way , as he ran , he pulled out of his pocket the money , for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father 's gore . 
Oh , now he needed money more than ever . 
Karamazov would die , Karamazov would shoot himself and it should be remembered ! 
To be sure , he was a poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life . 
` To her , to her ! 
and there , oh , there I will give a feast to the whole world , such as never was before , that will be remembered and talked of long after ! 
In the midst of shouts of wild merriment , reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I adore and her new-found happiness ! 
And then , on the spot , at her feet , I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself !
