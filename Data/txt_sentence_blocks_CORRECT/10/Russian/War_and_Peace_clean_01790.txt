So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking , and he roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving . 
At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would like to serve , and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign 's person , but for permission to serve in the army . 
Before the beginning of the campaign , Rostov had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha 's illness and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew -LRB- which they explained by Natasha 's having rejected him -RRB- and again asked Nicholas to retire from the army and return home . 
On receiving this letter , Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army , but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Natasha was ill and her engagement broken off , and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes . 
To Sonya he wrote separately . 
`` Adored friend of my soul ! '' 
he wrote . 
`` Nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country . 
But now , at the commencement of the campaign , I should feel dishonored , not only in my comrades ' eyes but in my own , if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the Fatherland . 
But this shall be our last separation .
