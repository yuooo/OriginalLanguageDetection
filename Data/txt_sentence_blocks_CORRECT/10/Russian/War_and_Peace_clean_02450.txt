Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory : `` These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel , having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal , and fired '' -LRB- the wretches -RRB- `` at the French . 
Some of them were sabered and the Kremlin was purged of their presence . '' 
Murat was informed that the way had been cleared . 
The French entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square . 
Out of the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for fuel and kindled fires there . 
Other detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped along the Moroseyka , the Lubyanka , and Pokrovka Streets . 
Others quartered themselves along the Vozdvizhenka , the Nikolski , and the Tverskoy Streets . 
No masters of the houses being found anywhere , the French were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp . 
Though tattered , hungry , worn out , and reduced to a third of their original number , the French entered Moscow in good marching order . 
It was a weary and famished , but still a fighting and menacing army .
