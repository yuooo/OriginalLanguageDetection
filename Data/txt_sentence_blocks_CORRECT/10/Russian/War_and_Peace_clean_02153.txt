Having sat still for a while he touched -- himself not knowing why - the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait , rose , and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty . 
He ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent , that the Old Guard , stationed round it , might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of Rome , the son and heir of their adored monarch . 
And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with him , they heard , as Napoleon had anticipated , the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait . 
`` Vive l'Empereur ! 
Vive le roi de Rome ! 
Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
came those ecstatic cries . 
After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset 's presence dictated his order of the day to the army . 
`` Short and energetic ! '' 
he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections .
