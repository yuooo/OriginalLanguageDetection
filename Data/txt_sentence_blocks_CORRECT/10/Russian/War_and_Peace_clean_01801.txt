Ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to Mary Hendrikhovna , asking her to stir it with her finger . 
`` This is my cup , '' said he . 
`` Only dip your finger in it and I 'll drink it all up . '' 
When they had emptied the samovar , Rostov took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play `` Kings '' with Mary Hendrikhovna . 
They drew lots to settle who should make up her set . 
At Rostov 's suggestion it was agreed that whoever became `` King '' should have the right to kiss Mary Hendrikhovna 's hand , and that the `` Booby '' should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke . 
`` Well , but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is ` King ' ? '' 
asked Ilyin . 
`` As it is , she is Queen , and her word is law ! '' 
They had hardly begun to play before the doctor 's disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna .
