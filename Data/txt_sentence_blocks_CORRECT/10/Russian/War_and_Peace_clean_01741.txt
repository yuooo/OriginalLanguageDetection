`` Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it ? 
I have waited eighteen months for explanations .

`` The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen , sire , '' replied Balashev . 
`` The Niemen ? '' 
repeated Napoleon . 
`` So now you want me to retire beyond the Niemen -- only the Niemen ? '' 
repeated Napoleon , looking straight at Balashev .
