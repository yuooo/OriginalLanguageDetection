He dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the Russian and French forces . 
In the refreshment room and the hall , footmen were bustling about with wine and viands . 
Groups of singers stood outside the windows . 
The officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together , and among them Ermolov 's big imposing figure . 
They all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces , laughing loudly . 
In the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility . 
`` Ha , ha , ha ! 
Bravo , Nicholas Ivanych ! 
Ha , ha , ha ! '' 
The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame , and he would have preferred to wait ; but one of the generals espied him and , hearing what he had come about , informed Ermolov .
