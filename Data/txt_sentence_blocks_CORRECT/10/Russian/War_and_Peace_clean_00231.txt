Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible , but it was evident that if the princess did speak , her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikhaylovna .

`` Pierre , my dear , come here . 
I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation ; is it not so , Prince ? '' 
`` Why do n't you speak , cousin ? '' 
suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled . 
`` Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere , making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man 's room ?

she hissed viciously , and tugged with all her might at the portfolio .
