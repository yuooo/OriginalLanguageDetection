When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a special messenger , a police officer , had come from Count Rostopchin to know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving the town . 
A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room . 
Pierre dressed hurriedly and , instead of going to see them , went to the back porch and out through the gate . 
From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of Bezukhov 's household , despite all the search they made , saw Pierre again or knew where he was . 
The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September , that is , till the eve of the enemy 's entry into the city . 
After Petya had joined Obolenski 's regiment of Cossacks and left for Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming , the countess was seized with terror . 
The thought that both her sons were at the war , had both gone from under her wing , that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances , struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness . 
She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Petya , or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg , but neither of these proved possible . 
Petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service . 
Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter , in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess Mary .
