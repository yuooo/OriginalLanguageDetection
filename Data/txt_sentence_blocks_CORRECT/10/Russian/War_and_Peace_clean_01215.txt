In the third category he included those Brothers -LRB- the majority -RRB- who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies , and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance . 
Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal lodge . 
Finally , to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged , particularly those who had lately joined . 
These according to Pierre 's observations were men who had no belief in anything , nor desire for anything , but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank , and of whom there were very many in the lodge . 
Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing . 
Freemasonry , at any rate as he saw it here , sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals . 
He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself , but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles . 
And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order . 
In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg . 
Our Freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons , had been initiated into many mysteries , had been raised to a higher grade , and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia .
