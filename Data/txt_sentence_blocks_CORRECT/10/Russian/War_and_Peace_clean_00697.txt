`` You have earned the St. George 's standards and will be worthy of them . '' 
`` Oh , to die , to die for him , '' thought Rostov . 
The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear , and the soldiers , straining their lungs , shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
Rostov too , bending over his saddle , shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
with all his might , feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout , if only to express his rapture fully . 
The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided . 
`` How can the Emperor be undecided ? '' 
thought Rostov , but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting , like everything else the Tsar did . 
That hesitation lasted only an instant . 
The Tsar 's foot , in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable , touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode , his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins , and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp .
