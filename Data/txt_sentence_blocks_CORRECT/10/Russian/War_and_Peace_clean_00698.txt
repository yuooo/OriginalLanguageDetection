Farther and farther he rode away , stopping at other regiments , till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors . 
Among the gentlemen of the suite , Rostov noticed Bolkonski , sitting his horse indolently and carelessly . 
Rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski . 
`` Of course not ! '' 
he now thought . 
`` Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment ? 
At a time of such love , such rapture , and such self-sacrifice , what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter ? 
I love and forgive everybody now . '' 
When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments , the troops began a ceremonial march past him , and Rostov on Bedouin , recently purchased from Denisov , rode past too , at the rear of his squadron - that is , alone and in full view of the Emperor . 
Before he reached him , Rostov , who was a splendid horseman , spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited .
