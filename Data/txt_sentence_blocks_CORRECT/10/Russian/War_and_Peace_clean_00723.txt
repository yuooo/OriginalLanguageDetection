The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait . 
At midday he was admitted to the Emperor , and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army . 
It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon . 
To the joy and pride of the whole army , a personal interview was refused , and instead of the Sovereign , Prince Dolgorukov , the victor at Wischau , was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if , contrary to expectations , these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace . 
Toward evening Dolgorukov came back , went straight to the Tsar , and remained alone with him for a long time . 
On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November , the army advanced two days ' march and the enemy 's outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated . 
In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth , a great , excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth , when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought . 
Till midday on the nineteenth , the activity -- the eager talk , running to and fro , and dispatching of adjutants -- was confined to the Emperor 's headquarters . 
But on the afternoon of that day , this activity reached Kutuzov 's headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns . 
By evening , the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army , and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth , the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices , and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long .
