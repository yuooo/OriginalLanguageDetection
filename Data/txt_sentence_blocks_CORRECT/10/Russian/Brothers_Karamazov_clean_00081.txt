`` I earnestly beg you , too , not to disturb yourself , and not to be uneasy , '' the elder said impressively . 
`` Do not trouble . 
Make yourself quite at home . 
And , above all , do not be so ashamed of yourself , for that is at the root of it all . '' 
`` Quite at home ? 
To be my natural self ? 
Oh , that is much too much , but I accept it with grateful joy . 
Do you know , blessed father , you 'd better not invite me to be my natural self . 
Do n't risk it ... . 
I will not go so far as that myself .
