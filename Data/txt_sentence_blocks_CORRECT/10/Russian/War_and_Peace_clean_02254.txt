But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient , there must also be a possibility of doing it , and that possibility did not exist . 
It was impossible not to retreat a day 's march , and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day 's march , and at last , on the first of September when the army drew near Moscow -- despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks -- the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow . 
And the troops retired one more , last , day 's march , and abandoned Moscow to the enemy . 
For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals -- as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle -- the questions present themselves : Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that ? 
Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fili ? 
Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road , abandoning Moscow ? 
and so on . 
People accustomed to think in that way forget , or do not know , the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief . 
The activity of a commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign on the map , with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality , and begin our plans from some given moment . 
A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event - the position from which we always contemplate it .
