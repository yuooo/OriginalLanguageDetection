`` Oh , I really did not mean to hurt her feelings . 
I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them . '' 
Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately . 
`` I have known you a long time , you see , and am as fond of you as of a brother , '' she said . 
`` How do you find Andrew ? '' 
she added hurriedly , not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words . 
`` I am very anxious about him . 
His health was better in the winter , but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure . 
And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually . 
He has not a character like us women who , when we suffer , can weep away our sorrows .
