Parties were formed , some accusing Pierre of Illuminism , others supporting him . 
At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of men 's minds , which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons . 
Even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to , as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it . 
* The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions . 
At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will reproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone , but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute . 
Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted . 
He was told that it would not , and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home . 
Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded . 
For three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere . 
It was just then that he received a letter from his wife , who implored him to see her , telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him .
