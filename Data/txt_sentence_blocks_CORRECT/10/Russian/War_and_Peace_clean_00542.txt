`` There ... he 's puffing again , '' muttered Tushin to himself , as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind . 
`` Now look out for the ball ... we 'll throw it back . '' 
`` What do you want , your honor ? '' 
asked an artilleryman , standing close by , who heard him muttering . 
`` Nothing ... only a shell ... '' he answered . 
`` Come along , our Matvevna ! '' 
he said to himself . 
`` Matvevna '' * was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery , which was large and of an old pattern . 
The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants . 
In that world , the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun 's crew was `` uncle '' ; Tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement .
