The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs . 
`` Uncle '' asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home , and then went out of the room . 
Rugay , his back still muddy , came into the room and lay down on the sofa , cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth . 
Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen . 
From behind this came women 's laughter and whispers . 
Natasha , Nicholas , and Petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa . 
Petya , leaning on his elbow , fell asleep at once . 
Natasha and Nicholas were silent . 
Their faces glowed , they were hungry and very cheerful . 
They looked at one another -LRB- now that the hunt was over and they were in the house , Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister -RRB- , Natasha gave him a wink , and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it .
