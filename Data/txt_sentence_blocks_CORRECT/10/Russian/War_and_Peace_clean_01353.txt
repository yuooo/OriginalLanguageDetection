Secondly because , as far as I know , that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew . 
I do not think he would choose her for a wife , and frankly I do not wish it . 
But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet . 
Good-by , my dear friend . 
May God keep you in His holy and mighty care . 
My dear friend , Mademoiselle Bourienne , sends you kisses . 
MARY In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news . 
He informed her of his engagement to Natasha Rostova . 
The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister . 
He wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was .
