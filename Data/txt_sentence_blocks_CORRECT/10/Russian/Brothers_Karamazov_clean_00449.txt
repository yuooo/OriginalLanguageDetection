Connoisseurs of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh , still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty , would `` spread '' ; that the face would become puffy , and that wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes ; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps - in fact , that it was the beauty of the moment , the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women . 
Alyosha , of course , did not think of this ; but though he was fascinated , yet he wondered with an unpleasant sensation , and as it were regretfully , why she drawled in that way and could not speak naturally . 
She did so , evidently feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated , honeyed modulation of the syllables . 
It was , of course , only a bad , underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea of good manners . 
And yet this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression of her face , the soft , babyish joy in her eyes . 
Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an arm-chair facing Alyosha , and ecstatically kissed her several times on her smiling lips . 
She seemed quite in love with her . 
`` This is the first time we 've met , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said rapturously . 
`` I wanted to know her , to see her . 
I wanted to go to her , but I 'd no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me .
