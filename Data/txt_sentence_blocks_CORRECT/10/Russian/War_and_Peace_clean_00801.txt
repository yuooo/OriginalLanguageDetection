`` Where is the Emperor ? 
Where is Kutuzov ? '' 
Rostov kept asking everyone he could stop , but got no answer from anyone . 
At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer . 
`` Eh , brother ! 
They 've all bolted long ago ! '' 
said the soldier , laughing for some reason and shaking himself free . 
Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk , Rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him . 
The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded . 
`` It ca n't be ! ''
