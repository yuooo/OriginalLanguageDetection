The men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew 's study into the bedroom . 
On their faces was a quiet and solemn look . 
Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house , now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage . 
Some women passing with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away . 
She did not venture to ask any questions , and shut the door again , now sitting down in her easy chair , now taking her prayer book , now kneeling before the icon stand . 
To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement . 
Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse , Praskovya Savishna , who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it , appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head . 
`` I 've come to sit with you a bit , Masha , '' said the nurse , `` and here I 've brought the prince 's wedding candles to light before his saint , my angel , '' she said with a sigh . 
`` Oh , nurse , I 'm so glad ! '' 
`` God is merciful , birdie . ''
