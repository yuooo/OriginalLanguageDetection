The magnificent reception room was crowded . 
Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor , having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man , passed out , slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed on him by the doctors , clergy , and relatives of the family . 
Prince Vasili , who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days , escorted him to the door , repeating something to him several times in low tones . 
When the Military Governor had gone , Prince Vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom , crossing one leg high over the other , leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand . 
After sitting so for a while he rose , and , looking about him with frightened eyes , went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house , to the room of the eldest princess . 
Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers , and , whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man 's room , grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door , which creaked slightly when opened . 
`` The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed , '' said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his words . 
`` I wonder , is it not too late to administer unction ? '' 
asked the lady , adding the priest 's clerical title , as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject . 
`` Ah , madam , it is a great sacrament , '' replied the priest , passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head .
