`` He is here somewhere , no doubt - under that table with the material evidence on it , perhaps . 
Where should he sit if not there ? 
You see , listen to me . 
I told him I do n't want to keep quiet , and he talked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy ! 
Come , release the monster ... he 's been singing a hymn . 
That 's because his heart is light ! 
It 's like a drunken man in the street bawling how ` Vanka went to Petersburg , ' and I would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy . 
You do n't know me ! 
Oh , how stupid all this business is ! 
Come , take me instead of him !
