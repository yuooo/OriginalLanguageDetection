She , seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men , beamed with satisfaction , try as she might to hide it , and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her . 
There was only one spoon , sugar was more plentiful than anything else , but it took too long to dissolve , so it was decided that Mary Hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn . 
Rostov received his tumbler , and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendrikhovna to stir it . 
`` But you take it without sugar ? '' 
she said , smiling all the time , as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning . 
`` It is not the sugar I want , but only that your little hand should stir my tea . '' 
Mary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on . 
`` Use your finger , Mary Hendrikhovna , it will be still nicer , '' said Rostov . 
`` Too hot ! '' 
she replied , blushing with pleasure .
