When she had completed the tour of the garden , which brought her again to the house , she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne -- who had remained at Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it -- coming toward her with a stranger . 
This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district , who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure . 
Princess Mary listened without understanding him ; she led him to the house , offered him lunch , and sat down with him . 
Then , excusing herself , she went to the door of the old prince 's room . 
The doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter . 
`` Go away , Princess ! 
Go away ... go away ! '' 
She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond , where no one could see her . 
She did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman 's footsteps running along the path . 
She rose and saw Dunyasha her maid , who was evidently looking for her , and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress .
