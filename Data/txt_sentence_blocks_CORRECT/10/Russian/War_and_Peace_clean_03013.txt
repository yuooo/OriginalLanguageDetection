`` I am thinking of what you have told me , '' answered Princess Mary . 
`` This is what I will say . 
You are right that to speak to her of love at present ... '' Princess Mary stopped . 
She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible , but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love , but that it was the very thing she wished for . 
`` To speak to her now would n't do , '' said the princess all the same . 
`` But what am I to do ? '' 
`` Leave it to me , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` I know ... '' Pierre was looking into Princess Mary 's eyes . 
`` Well ? 
... Well ?
