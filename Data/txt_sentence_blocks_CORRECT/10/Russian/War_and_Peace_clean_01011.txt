The hairs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile . 
His huge figure , with arms hanging down and with a puckered , though smiling face , moved after Willarski with uncertain , timid steps . 
Having led him about ten paces , Willarski stopped . 
`` Whatever happens to you , '' he said , `` you must bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood . ''

`` When you hear a knock at the door , you will uncover your eyes , '' added Willarski . 
`` I wish you courage and success , '' and , pressing Pierre 's hand , he went out .

Once or twice he shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief , as if wishing to take it off , but let it drop again . 
The five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour .
