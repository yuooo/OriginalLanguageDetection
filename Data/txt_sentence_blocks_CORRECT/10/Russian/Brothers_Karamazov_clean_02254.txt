Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner ? 
Let us consider the first alternative - that he did it alone . 
If he had killed him it must have been with some object , for some advantage to himself . 
But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder - hatred , jealousy , and so on - Smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the sake of gain , in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope . 
And yet he tells another person - and a person most closely interested , that is , the prisoner - everything about the money and the signals , where the envelope lay , what was written on it , what it was tied up with , and , above all , told him of those signals by which he could enter the house . 
Did he do this simply to betray himself , or to invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that envelope for himself ? 
` Yes , ' I shall be told , ` but he betrayed it from fear . ' 
But how do you explain this ? 
A man who could conceive such an audacious , savage act , and carry it out , tells facts which are known to no one else in the world , and which , if he held his tongue , no one would ever have guessed ! 
`` No , however cowardly he might be , if he had plotted such a crime , nothing would have induced him to tell anyone about the envelope and the signals , for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand .
