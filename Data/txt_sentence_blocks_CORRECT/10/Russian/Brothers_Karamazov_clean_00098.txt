he was three years old - three years all but three months . 
For my little boy , Father , I 'm in anguish , for my little boy . 
He was the last one left . 
We had four , my Nikita and I , and now we 've no children , our dear ones have all gone I buried the first three without grieving overmuch , and now I have buried the last I ca n't forget him . 
He seems always standing before me . 
He never leaves me . 
He has withered my heart . 
I look at his little clothes , his little shirt , his little boots , and I wail . 
I lay out all that is left of him , all his little things . 
I look at them and wail .
