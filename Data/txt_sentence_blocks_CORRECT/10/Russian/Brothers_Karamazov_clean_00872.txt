Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway , Father Zossima smiled at him joyfully and held out his hand . 
`` Welcome , my quiet one , welcome , my dear , here you are too . 
I knew you would come . '' 
Alyosha went up to him , bowed down before him to the ground and wept . 
Something surged up from his heart , his soul was quivering , he wanted to sob . 
`` Come , do n't weep over me yet , '' Father Zossima smiled , laying his right hand on his head . 
`` You see I am sitting up talking ; maybe I shall live another twenty years yet , as that dear good woman from Vishegorye , with her little Lizaveta in her arms , wished me yesterday . 
God bless the mother and the little girl Lizaveta , '' he crossed himself . 
`` Porfiry , did you take her offering where I told you ? '' 
He meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good-humoured woman to be given `` to someone poorer than me . ''
