`` I know , I expect you thought of him , '' said Nicholas , smiling as Natasha knew by the sound of his voice . 
`` No , '' said Natasha , though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest , and of how he would have liked `` Uncle . '' 
`` And then I was saying to myself all the way , ` How well Anisya carried herself , how well ! ' '' 
And Nicholas heard her spontaneous , happy , ringing laughter . 
`` And do you know , '' she suddenly said , `` I know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now . '' 
`` Rubbish , nonsense , humbug ! '' 
exclaimed Nicholas , and he thought : `` How charming this Natasha of mine is ! 
I have no other friend like her and never shall have . 
Why should she marry ? 
We might always drive about together ! ''
