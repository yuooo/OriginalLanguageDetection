Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points . 
More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French . 
Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms . 
Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses . 
The remains of Langeron 's and Dokhturov 's mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd . 
After five o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade -LRB- delivered by the French alone -RRB- was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights , directed at our retreating forces . 
In the rearguard , Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops . 
It was growing dusk . 
On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling , while his grandson , with shirt sleeves rolled up , handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can , on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts -- on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon , under the horses ' hoofs and between the wagon wheels , men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together , crushing one another , dying , stepping over the dying and killing one another , only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way . 
Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around , or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng , killing some and splashing with blood those near them .
