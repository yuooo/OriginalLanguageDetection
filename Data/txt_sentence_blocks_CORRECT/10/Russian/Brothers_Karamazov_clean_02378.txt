So much has happened to him since that day . 
He realises that he has injured you beyond all reckoning . 
He does not ask your forgiveness - ` It 's impossible to forgive me , ' he says himself - but only that you would show yourself in his doorway . '' 
`` It 's so sudden ... '' faltered Katya . 
`` I 've had a presentiment all these days that you would come with that message . 
I knew he would ask me to come . 
It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Let it be impossible , but do it . 
Only think , he realises for the first time how he has wounded you , the first time in his life ; he had never grasped it before so fully . 
He said , ` If she refuses to come I shall be unhappy all my life . '
