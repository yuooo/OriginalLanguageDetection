`` That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you , foreseeing trouble in the house , to spare you . 
Only I wanted to spare myself even more . 
That 's why I told you to get out of harm 's way , that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house , and would remain at home to protect your father . '' 
`` You might have said it more directly , you blockhead ! '' 
Ivan suddenly fired up . 
`` How could I have said it more directly then ? 
It was simply my fear that made me speak , and you might have been angry , too . 
I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money , for he considered it as good as his own ; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this ? 
I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master 's mattress in the envelope , and you see , he 's murdered him . 
How could you guess it either , sir ? ''
