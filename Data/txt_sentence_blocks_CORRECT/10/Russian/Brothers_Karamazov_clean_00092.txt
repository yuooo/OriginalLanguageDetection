They had been told that the elder was at last coming out , and they had gathered together in anticipation . 
Two ladies , Madame Hohlakov and her daughter , had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder , but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank . 
Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady , still young and attractive , and always dressed with taste . 
She was rather pale , and had lively black eyes . 
She was not more than thirty-three , and had been five years a widow . 
Her daughter , a girl of fourteen , was partially paralysed . 
The poor child had not been able to walk for the last six months , and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair . 
She had a charming little face , rather thin from illness , but full of gaiety . 
There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with their long lashes . 
Her mother had been intending to take her abroad ever since the spring , but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate .
