The wooded ravines and the copses , which at the end of August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble , had become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye . 
The hares had already half changed their summer coats , the fox cubs were beginning to scatter , and the young wolves were bigger than dogs . 
It was the best time of the year for the chase . 
The hounds of that ardent young sportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition , but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days ' rest and then , on the sixteenth of September , to go on a distant expedition , starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs . 
All that day the hounds remained at home . 
It was frosty and the air was sharp , but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw . 
On the fifteenth , when young Rostov , in his dressing gown , looked out of the window , he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting : it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind . 
The only motion in the air was that of the dripping , microscopic particles of drizzling mist . 
The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves . 
The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull , moist veil of mist .
