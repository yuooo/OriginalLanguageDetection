In the large drawing room which had become the commander in chief 's office were gathered Kutuzov himself , Weyrother , and the members of the council of war . 
They were drinking tea , and only awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council . 
At last Bagration 's orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend . 
Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and , availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutuzov to be present at the council , he remained in the room . 
`` Since Prince Bagration is not coming , we may begin , '' said Weyrother , hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out . 
Kutuzov , with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping , was sitting almost asleep in a low chair , with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms . 
At the sound of Weyrother 's voice , he opened his one eye with an effort . 
`` Yes , yes , if you please ! 
It is already late , '' said he , and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye . 
If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was pretending to sleep , the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else -- he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep .
