`` If they 're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm , but as things are now one ca n't answer for anything . '' 
`` But you see what he writes ... '' said another , pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand . 
`` That 's another matter . 
That 's necessary for the people , '' said the first . 
`` What is it ? ''

`` Oh , it 's a fresh broadsheet . ''
