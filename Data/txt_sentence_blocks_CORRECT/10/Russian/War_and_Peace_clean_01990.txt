He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow , but I think it would now be better to stay here , '' said Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` Because , you will agree , chere Marie , to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible . '' 
Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation -LRB- not printed on ordinary Russian paper -RRB- of General Rameau 's , telling people not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford them proper protection . 
She handed this to the princess . 
`` I think it would be best to appeal to that general , '' she continued , `` and and am sure that all due respect would be shown you . '' 
Princess Mary read the paper , and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs . 
`` From whom did you get this ? '' 
she asked . 
`` They probably recognized that I am French , by my name , '' replied Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing . 
Princess Mary , with the paper in her hand , rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew 's study .
