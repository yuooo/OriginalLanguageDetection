`` What tortures ? 
Ah , do n't ask . 
In old days we had all sorts , but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments - ` the stings of conscience ' and all that nonsense . 
We got that , too , from you , from the softening of your manners . 
And who 's the better for it ? 
Only those who have got no conscience , for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have none ? 
But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honour suffer for it . 
Reforms , when the ground has not been prepared for them , especially if they are institutions copied from abroad , do nothing but mischief ! 
The ancient fire was better . 
Well , this man , who was condemned to the quadrillion kilometres , stood still , looked round and lay down across the road . '
