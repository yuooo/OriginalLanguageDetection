O God , grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness , and behave so that he too may benefit . 
After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear , `` Thy day ! '' 
I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs , but I went on undismayed . 
Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go . 
I began to throttle it with my hands . 
Scarcely had I torn it off before another , a bigger one , began biting me . 
I lifted it up , but the higher I lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew . 
And suddenly Brother A. came and , taking my arm , led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank . 
I stepped on it , but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands . 
After much effort I dragged myself up , so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other .
