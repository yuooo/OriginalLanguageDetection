In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm -- news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor 's return -- was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly , though with much caution . 
Anna Pavlovna 's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients . 
Prince Vasili , who still occupied his former important posts , formed a connecting link between these two circles . 
He visited his `` good friend Anna Pavlovna '' as well as his daughter 's `` diplomatic salon , '' and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at Helene 's what he should have said at Anna Pavlovna 's and vice versa . 
Soon after the Emperor 's return Prince Vasili in a conversation about the war at Anna Pavlovna 's severely condemned Barclay de Tolly , but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief . 
One of the visitors , usually spoken of as `` a man of great merit , '' having described how he had that day seen Kutuzov , the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg militia , presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury , cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements . 
Anna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov had done nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance . 
`` I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility , '' Prince Vasili interrupted , `` but they did not listen to me . 
I told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor . 
They did not listen to me .
