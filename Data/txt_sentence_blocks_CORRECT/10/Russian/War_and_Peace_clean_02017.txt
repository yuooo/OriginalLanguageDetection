Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled . 
`` Or perhaps they amuse your honor ? '' 
remarked Alpatych with a staid air , as he pointed at the old men with his free hand . 
`` No , there 's not much to be amused at here , '' said Rostov , and rode on a little way . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here do n't wish to let the mistress leave the estate , and threaten to unharness her horses , so that though everything has been packed up since morning , her excellency can not get away . '' 
`` Impossible ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov . 
`` I have the honor to report to you the actual truth , '' said Alpatych .
