`` Hold him ! 
Hold him ! '' 
he cried , and dashed after Dmitri . 
Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor , but still seemed stunned . 
Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father . 
In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash : it was a large glass vase - not an expensive one - on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it . 
`` At him ! '' 
shouted the old man . 
`` Help ! '' 
Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back .
