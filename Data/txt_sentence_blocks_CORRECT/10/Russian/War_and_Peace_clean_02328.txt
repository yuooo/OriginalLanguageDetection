There was also much china standing on the tables , and still more was being brought in from the storeroom . 
A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it . 
`` Sonya , wait a bit -- we 'll pack everything into these , '' said Natasha . 
`` You ca n't , Miss , we have tried to , '' said the butler 's assistant . 
`` No , wait a minute , please . '' 
And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper .
