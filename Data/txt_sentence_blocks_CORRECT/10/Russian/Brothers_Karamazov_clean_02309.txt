And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna , lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck , and say , ' I am a scoundrel , but not a thief . ' 
So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye , why he should n't unpick the little bag , and spend it a hundred at a time . 
Why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honour ? 
Yes , he has a sense of honour , granted that it 's misplaced , granted it 's often mistaken , yet it exists and amounts to a passion , and he has proved that . 
`` But now the affair becomes even more complex ; his jealous torments reach a climax , and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and more : ` If I repay Katerina Ivanovna , where can I find the means to go off with Grushenka ? ' 
If he behaved wildly , drank , and made disturbances in the taverns in the course of that month , it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance . 
These two questions became so acute that they drove him at last to despair . 
He sent his younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles , but without waiting for a reply , burst in himself and ended by beating the old man in the presence of witnesses . 
After that he had no prospect of getting it from anyone ; his father would not give it him after that beating . 
`` The same evening he struck himself on the breast , just on the upper part of the breast where the little bag was , and swore to his brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel , but that still he would remain a scoundrel , for he foresaw that he would not use that means , that he would n't have the character , that he would n't have the will-power to do it .
