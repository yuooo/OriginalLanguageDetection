`` Gentlemen , '' said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time . 
`` Please place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning . '' 
One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted . 
`` Yes , you might , but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed . 
So I ask you to put the money on your cards , '' replied Dolokhov . 
`` Do n't stint yourself , we 'll settle afterwards , '' he added , turning to Rostov . 
The game continued ; a waiter kept handing round champagne . 
All Rostov 's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him . 
He wrote `` 800 rubles '' on a card , but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles . 
`` Leave it , '' said Dolokhov , though he did not seem to be even looking at Rostov , `` you 'll win it back all the sooner .
