`` Why ? 
I love you more than ever , '' said Princess Mary , `` and I will try to do all I can for your happiness . '' 
`` But you despise me . 
You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion . 
Oh , only my poor mother ... '' `` I quite understand , '' answered Princess Mary , with a sad smile . 
`` Calm yourself , my dear . 
I will go to my father , '' she said , and went out . 
Prince Vasili , with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand , was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face , as if stirred to his heart 's core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility , when Princess Mary entered . 
He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff .
