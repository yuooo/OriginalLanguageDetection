I whispered . 
` There , in the corner , ' he pointed . 
He was whispering , too . 
` Wait a bit , '' I said . 
I went to the corner of the garden to look , and there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall , covered with blood , senseless . 
So it 's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here , was the thought that came into my head , and I determined on the spot to make an end of it , as Grigory Vassilyevitch , even if he were alive , would see nothing of it , as he lay there senseless . 
The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up . 
I felt that at the moment , but the longing to get it done came over me , till I could scarcely breathe . 
I went back to the window to the master and said , ` She 's here , she 's come ; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come , wants to be let in . ' 
And he started like a baby .
