But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings . 
As soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses , the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript , neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders . 
When five weeks later these same men left Moscow , they no longer formed an army . 
They were a mob of marauders , each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful . 
The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer , as it had been , to conquer , but merely to keep what he had acquired . 
Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug , and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds , and therefore perishes , the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them , yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts . 
Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow district , not a soldier or officer was left . 
Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows , laughing and walking through the rooms . 
In cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions , and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors , lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves , and cooking ; or frightening , amusing , or caressing women and children . 
There were many such men both in the shops and houses -- but there was no army .
