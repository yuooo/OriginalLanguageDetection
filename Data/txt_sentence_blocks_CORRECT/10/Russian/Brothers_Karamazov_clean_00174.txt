But this captain , this agent of yours , went to that lady whom you call an enchantress , and suggested to her from you , that she should take I.O.U.s of mine which were in your possession , and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them , if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my property . 
Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you yourself incited her to captivate me ! 
She told me so to my face ... . 
She told me the story and laughed at you ... . 
You wanted to put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her , because you 'd begun to force your attentions upon her ; and I know all about that , too ; she laughed at you for that as well - you hear - she laughed at you as she described it . 
So here you have this man , this father who reproaches his profligate son ! 
Gentlemen , forgive my anger , but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you together to create a scandal . 
I had come to forgive him if he held out his hand ; to forgive him , and ask forgiveness ! 
But as he has just this minute insulted not only me , but an honourable young lady , for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her name in vain , I have made up my mind to show up his game , though he is my father ... '' He could not go on . 
His eyes were glittering and he breathed with difficulty .
