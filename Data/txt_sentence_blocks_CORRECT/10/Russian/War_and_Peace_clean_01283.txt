The despairing , dejected expression of Natasha 's face caught his eye . 
He recognized her , guessed her feelings , saw that it was her debut , remembered her conversation at the window , and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova . 
`` Allow me to introduce you to my daughter , '' said the countess , with heightened color . 
`` I have the pleasure of being already acquainted , if the countess remembers me , '' said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying Peronskaya 's remarks about his rudeness , and approaching Natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation . 
He asked her to waltz . 
That tremulous expression on Natasha 's face , prepared either for despair or rapture , suddenly brightened into a happy , grateful , childlike smile . 
`` I have long been waiting for you , '' that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears , as she raised her hand to Prince Andrew 's shoulder . 
They were the second couple to enter the circle . 
Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely . 
Her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly , lightly , and independently of herself , while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness .
