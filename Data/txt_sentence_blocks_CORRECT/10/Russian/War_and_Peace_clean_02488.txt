Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine . 
The captain looked at Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his companion 's face . 
Ramballe , with genuine distress and sympathy in his face , went up to Pierre and bent over him . 
`` There now , we 're sad , '' said he , touching Pierre 's hand . 
`` Have I upset you ? 
No , really , have you anything against me ? '' 
he asked Pierre . 
`` Perhaps it 's the state of affairs ? '' 
Pierre did not answer , but looked cordially into the Frenchman 's eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him . 
`` Honestly , without speaking of what I owe you , I feel friendship for you .
