If you have seen amiss , sir , do not allow yourself to say what you do n't know ! 
Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow , '' said Kutuzov sternly . 
All were silent , and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general . 
`` They are repulsed everywhere , for which I thank God and our brave army ! 
The enemy is beaten , and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of Russia , '' said Kutuzov crossing himself , and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears . 
Wolzogen , shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips , stepped silently aside , marveling at `` the old gentleman 's '' conceited stupidity . 
`` Ah , here he is , my hero ! '' 
said Kutuzov to a portly , handsome , dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll . 
This was Raevski , who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of Borodino . 
Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the French no longer ventured to attack .
