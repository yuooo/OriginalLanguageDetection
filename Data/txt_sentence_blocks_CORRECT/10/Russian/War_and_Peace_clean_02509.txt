She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold , damp earthen floor of the passage . 
The cold she felt refreshed her . 
With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man , stepped over him , and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay . 
It was dark in there . 
In the farthest corner , on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying , stood a tallow candle with a long , thick , and smoldering wick . 
From the moment she had been told that of Prince Andrew 's wound and his presence there , Natasha had resolved to see him . 
She did not know why she had to , she knew the meeting would be painful , but felt the more convinced that it was necessary . 
All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night . 
But now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see . 
How was he maimed ?
