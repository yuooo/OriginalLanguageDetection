There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them . 
Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns . 
The first person Rostov met in the officers ' ward was a thin little man with one arm , who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown , with a pipe between his teeth . 
Rostov looked at him , trying to remember where he had seen him before . 
`` See where we 've met again ! '' 
said the little man . 
`` Tushin , Tushin , do n't you remember , who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern ? 
And I 've had a bit cut off , you see ... '' he went on with a smile , pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown . 
`` Looking for Vasili Dmitrich Denisov ? 
My neighbor , '' he added , when he heard who Rostov wanted .
