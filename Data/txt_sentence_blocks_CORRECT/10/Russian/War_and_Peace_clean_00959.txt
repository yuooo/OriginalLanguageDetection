Have I killed anyone , or insulted or wished harm to anyone ? 
Why such a terrible misfortune ? 
And when did it begin ? 
Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma 's name day and then going home . 
I was so happy , so free , so lighthearted ! 
And I did not realize how happy I was ! 
When did that end and when did this new , terrible state of things begin ? 
What marked the change ? 
I sat all the time in this same place at this table , chose and placed cards , and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way . 
When did it happen and what has happened ?
