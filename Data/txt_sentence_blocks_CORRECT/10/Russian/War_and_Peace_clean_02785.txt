Beyond Shamshevo , Dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way , to find out at what distance there were other French troops . 
They reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men . 
Denisov had two hundred , and Dolokhov might have as many more , but the disparity of numbers did not deter Denisov . 
All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a `` tongue '' -- that is , a man from the enemy column . 
That morning 's attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed ; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive , and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column . 
Denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert , so he sent Tikhon Shcherbaty , a peasant of his party , to Shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance . 
It was a warm rainy autumn day . 
The sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water . 
At times a sort of mist descended , and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down . 
Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides .
