`` It is done ! '' 
she said to the count , pointing triumphantly to the countess , who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter , and pressing them alternately to her lips . 
When she saw the count , she stretched out her arms to him , embraced his bald head , over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait , and in order to press them again to her lips , she slightly pushed away the bald head . 
Vera , Natasha , Sonya , and Petya now entered the room , and the reading of the letter began . 
After a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part , and his promotion , Nicholas said that he kissed his father 's and mother 's hands asking for their blessing , and that he kissed Vera , Natasha , and Petya . 
Besides that , he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling , Madame Schoss , and his old nurse , and asked them to kiss for him `` dear Sonya , whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever . '' 
When she heard this Sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and , unable to bear the looks turned upon her , ran away into the dancing hall , whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon , and , flushed and smiling , plumped down on the floor . 
The countess was crying . 
`` Why are you crying , Mamma ? '' 
asked Vera .
