A beautiful and lonely spot , sir . 
Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual . 
He has a little hand , his fingers are thin and cold - he suffers with his chest , you know . 
` Father , ' said he , ` father ! ' 
` Well ? ' 
said I. I saw his eyes flashing . 
` Father , how he treated you then ! ' 
` It ca n't be helped , Ilusha , ' I said . 
` Do n't forgive him , father , do n't forgive him ! 
At school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it . '
