Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it . 
The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself . 
In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew , and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer , the largest landowner of the province . 
Temptations to Pierre 's greatest weakness -- the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodge -- were so strong that he could not resist them . 
Again whole days , weeks , and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties , dinners , lunches , and balls , giving him no time for reflection , as in Petersburg . 
Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life , only in new surroundings . 
Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life , and that of the seven virtues he lacked two -- morality and the love of death . 
He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts -- that of reforming the human race - and had other virtues -- love of his neighbor , and especially generosity . 
In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg . 
On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit .
