He had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey . 
Having wrung a submissive `` I understand '' from Dron , Alpatych contented himself with that , though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming . 
And so it was , for when evening came no carts had been provided . 
In the village , outside the drink shop , another meeting was being held , which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided . 
Without saying anything of this to the princess , Alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess ' carriages . 
Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities . 
After her father 's funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone . 
A maid came to the door to say that Alpatych was asking for orders about their departure . 
-LRB- This was before his talk with Dron . -RRB- 
Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace .
