By the way , Pyotr Ilyitch , I wanted to ask you : have you ever stolen anything in your life ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` Oh , I did n't mean anything . 
From somebody 's pocket , you know . 
I do n't mean government money , everyone steals that , and no doubt you do , too ... '' `` You go to the devil . '' 
`` I 'm talking of other people 's money . 
Stealing straight out of a pocket ? 
Out of a purse , eh ? '' 
`` I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old . 
I took it off the table on the sly , and held it tight in my hand . ''
