This battle , which consisted in the capture of a French squadron , was represented as a brilliant victory over the French , and so the Emperor and the whole army , especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield , believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will . 
A few minutes after the Emperor had passed , the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance . 
In Wischau itself , a petty German town , Rostov saw the Emperor again . 
In the market place , where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor 's arrival , lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move . 
The Emperor , surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers , was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare , a different one from that which he had ridden at the review , and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone , with blood on his uncovered head . 
The wounded soldier was so dirty , coarse , and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostov . 
Rostov saw how the Emperor 's rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them , how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse 's side with the spur , and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir . 
An adjutant , dismounting , lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought . 
The soldier groaned . 
`` Gently , gently !
