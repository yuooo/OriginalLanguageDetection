I challenge you ! '' 
he ejaculated , and , pushing back his chair , he rose from the table . 
At the very instant he did this and uttered those words , Pierre felt that the question of his wife 's guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative . 
He hated her and was forever sundered from her . 
Despite Denisov 's request that he would take no part in the matter , Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov 's second , and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesvitski , Bezukhov 's second . 
Pierre went home , but Rostov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed on at the Club till late , listening to the gypsies and other singers . 
`` Well then , till tomorrow at Sokolniki , '' said Dolokhov , as he took leave of Rostov in the Club porch . 
`` And do you feel quite calm ? '' 
Rostov asked . 
Dolokhov paused .
