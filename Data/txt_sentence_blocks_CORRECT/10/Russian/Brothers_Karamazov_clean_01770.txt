he cried with positive ferocity to the dog , and with rapid strides he went home . 
At Grushenka 's ALYOSHA went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov 's house to see Grushenka , who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an urgent message begging him to come . 
Questioning Fenya , Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day . 
During the two months that had passed since Mitya 's arrest , Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov 's house , both from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya . 
Three days after Mitya 's arrest , Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks . 
For one whole week she was unconscious . 
She was very much changed - thinner and a little sallow , though she had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out . 
But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than before , and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her . 
A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face . 
There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her , and a steadfast , fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her .
