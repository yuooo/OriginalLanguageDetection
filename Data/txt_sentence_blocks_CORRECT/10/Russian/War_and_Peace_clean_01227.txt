Among the many young men who frequented her house every day , Boris Drubetskoy , who had already achieved great success in the service , was the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household since Helene 's return from Erfurt . 
Helene spoke of him as `` mon page '' and treated him like a child . 
Her smile for him was the same as for everybody , but sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable . 
Toward him Boris behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference . 
This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre . 
He had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition , first by not being a husband to his wife , and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect . 
`` No , now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations , '' he told himself . 
`` There has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart '' -- a statement which , though gathered from an unknown source , he believed implicitly . 
Yet strange to say Boris ' presence in his wife 's drawing room -LRB- and he was almost always there -RRB- had a physical effect upon Pierre ; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements . 
`` What a strange antipathy , '' thought Pierre , `` yet I used to like him very much . ''
