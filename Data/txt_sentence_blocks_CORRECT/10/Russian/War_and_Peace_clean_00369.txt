`` Well , let me have it , young man , I 'm going . '' 
Rostov did not speak . 
`` And you ? 
Are you going to have lunch too ? 
They feed you quite decently here , '' continued Telyanin . 
`` Now then , let me have it . '' 
He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse . 
Rostov let go of it . 
Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches , with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open , as if to say , `` Yes , yes , I am putting my purse in my pocket and that 's quite simple and is no else 's business . '' 
`` Well , young man ? ''
