`` Will you step into the study ? '' 
Pierre nodded . 
`` As it was sealed up so it has remained , but Sophia Danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books . '' 
Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactor 's lifetime . 
The room , dusty and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier . 
Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe . 
Pierre went round the study , approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept , and took out what had once been one of the most important , the holy of holies of the order . 
This was the authentic Scotch Acts with Bazdeev 's notes and explanations . 
He sat down at the dusty writing table , and , having laid the manuscripts before him , opened them out , closed them , finally pushed them away , and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation . 
Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre always sitting in the same attitude .
