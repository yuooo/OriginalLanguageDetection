I know you are glad for my sake . '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' Pierre assented , looking at his friend with a touched and sad expression in his eyes . 
The brighter Prince Andrew 's lot appeared to him , the gloomier seemed his own . 
Prince Andrew needed his father 's consent to his marriage , and to obtain this he started for the country next day . 
His father received his son 's communication with external composure , but inward wrath . 
He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it , when his own life was already ending . 
`` If only they would let me end my days as I want to , '' thought the old man , `` then they might do as they please . '' 
With his son , however , he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and , adopting a quiet tone , discussed the whole matter . 
In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth , wealth , or rank . 
Secondly , Prince Andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health was poor -LRB- the old man laid special stress on this -RRB- , while she was very young .
