`` Your honor ... '' replied the shopman in the frieze coat , `` your honor , in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count , they desire to serve , not sparing their lives , and it is not any kind of riot , but as his highest excellence said ... '' `` The count has not left , he is here , and an order will be issued concerning you , '' said the superintendent of police . 
`` Go on ! '' 
he ordered his coachman . 
The crowd halted , pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said , and looking at the departing trap . 
The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look , said something to his coachman , and his horses increased their speed . 
`` It 's a fraud , lads ! 
Lead the way to him , himself ! '' 
shouted the tall youth . 
`` Do n't let him go , lads !
