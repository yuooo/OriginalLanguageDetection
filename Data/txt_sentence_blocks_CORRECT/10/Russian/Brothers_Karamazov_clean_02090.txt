Yes , there is that romantic strain in you , that was so derided by Byelinsky . 
I ca n't help it , young man , as I got ready to come to you I did think as a joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the Caucasus , with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat . 
But I was positively afraid of doing it , for you 'd have thrashed me for daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat , instead of , at least , the Polar Star or the Sirius . 
And you keep on saying I am stupid , but , mercy on us ! 
I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence . 
Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil , but did only good . 
Well , he can say what he likes , it 's quite the opposite with me . 
I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good . 
I was there when the Word , Who died on the Cross , rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul of the penitent thief . 
I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which shook heaven and all creation , and I swear to you by all that 's sacred , I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all .
