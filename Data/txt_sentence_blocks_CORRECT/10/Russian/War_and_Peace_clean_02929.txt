`` Ca n't you make less noise ? '' 
The men became silent . 
The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face , which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle . 
`` There , how that devil hits out ! 
He 's made my face all bloody , '' said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on . 
`` Do n't you like it ? '' 
said a laughing voice , and moderating their tones the men moved forward . 
When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before , interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives . 
In the hut which the men had passed , the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow . 
It was proposed to make a flank march to the left , cut off the Vice-King -LRB- Murat -RRB- and capture him .
