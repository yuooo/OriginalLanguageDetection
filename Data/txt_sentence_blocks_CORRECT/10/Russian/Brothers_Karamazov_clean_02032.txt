' 
Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience , so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible . 
At last she got up and she rushed to me , but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there , she ran out , and I heard her scream in the garden . 
And that set it all going and set my mind at rest . ''

The perspiration stood out on his face . 
But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling , or what .
