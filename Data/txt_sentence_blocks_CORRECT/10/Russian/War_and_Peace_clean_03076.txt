Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery . 
Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Natasha , her father 's pet , having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room , ran to her father unobserved by her mother . 
The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door , went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs , and having examined the position of her father , who was asleep with his back to her , rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head . 
Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face . 
`` Natasha , Natasha ! '' 
came Countess Mary 's frightened whisper from the door . 
`` Papa wants to sleep . '' 
`` No , Mamma , he does n't want to sleep , '' said little Natasha with conviction . 
`` He 's laughing . '' 
Nicholas lowered his legs , rose , and took his daughter in his arms .
