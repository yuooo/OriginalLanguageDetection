Though blows are forbidden , I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly . '' 
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish . 
`` In the ordinary occasions of life , '' he said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch 's table , `` in the ordinary occasions of life , blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law , and people have given them up , but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows , not only among us but all over the world , be it even the fullest republic of France , just as in the time of Adam and Eve , and they never will leave off , but you , even in an exceptional case , did not dare . '' 
`` What are you learning French words for ? '' 
Ivan nodded towards the exercise-book lying on the table . 
`` Why should n't I learn them so as to improve my education , supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe ? '' 
`` Listen , monster . '' 
Ivan 's eyes flashed and he trembled all over . 
`` I am not afraid of your accusations ; you can say what you like about me , and if I do n't beat you to death , it 's simply because I suspect you of that crime and I 'll drag you to justice . 
I 'll unmask you . ''
