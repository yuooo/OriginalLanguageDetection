`` And do you remember , '' Natasha asked with a pensive smile , `` how once , long , long ago , when we were quite little , Uncle called us into the study -- that was in the old house -- and it was dark -- we went in and suddenly there stood ... '' `` A Negro , '' chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight . 
`` Of course I remember . 
Even now I do n't know whether there really was a Negro , or if we only dreamed it or were told about him . '' 
`` He was gray , you remember , and had white teeth , and stood and looked at us ... '' `` Sonya , do you remember ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` Yes , yes , I do remember something too , '' Sonya answered timidly . 
`` You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro , '' said Natasha , `` and they say there was no Negro at all . 
But you see , you remember ! '' 
`` Of course I do , I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them . '' 
`` How strange it is !
