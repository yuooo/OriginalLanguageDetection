Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him , and began explaining the whole position of our troops . 
Pierre listened to him , straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle , but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task . 
He could make nothing of it . 
Bennigsen stopped speaking and , noticing that Pierre was listening , suddenly said to him : `` I do n't think this interests you ? '' 
`` On the contrary it 's very interesting ! ''
