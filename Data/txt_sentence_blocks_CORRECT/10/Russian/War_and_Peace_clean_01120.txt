On each side of the trench , the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet , and this did duty for bedsteads and couches . 
The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table . 
Denisov , who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him , had also a board in the roof at the farther end , with a piece of -LRB- broken but mended -RRB- glass in it for a window . 
When it was very cold , embers from the soldiers ' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the `` reception room '' -- as Denisov called that part of the hut - and it was then so warm that the officers , of whom there were always some with Denisov and Rostov , sat in their shirt sleeves . 
In April , Rostov was on orderly duty . 
One morning , between seven and eight , returning after a sleepless night , he sent for embers , changed his rain-soaked underclothes , said his prayers , drank tea , got warm , then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner , and , his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt , lay down on his back , putting his arms under his head . 
He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition , and was awaiting Denisov , who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk . 
Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut , evidently much excited . 
Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to , and saw the quartermaster , Topcheenko . 
`` I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff ! ''
