`` Quite different and yet the same , '' thought Nicholas , looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight . 
He slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head , embraced her , pressed her to him , and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork .

On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sonya 's face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present Sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again .
