I am like that . 
I am not offended at jealousy . 
I have a fierce heart , too . 
I can be jealous myself . 
Only what offends me is that he does n't love me at all . 
I tell you he is jealous now on purpose . 
Am I blind ? 
Do n't I see ? 
He began talking to me just now of that woman , of Katerina , saying she was this and that , how she had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him , to try and save him ; how she had ordered the best counsel , the most learned one , too . 
So he loves her , if he 'll praise her to my face , more shame to him !
