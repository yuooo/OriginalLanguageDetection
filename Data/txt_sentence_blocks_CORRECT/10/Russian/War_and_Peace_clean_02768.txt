While a footman was lighting a candle , Toll communicated the substance of the news . 
`` Who brought it ? '' 
asked Kutuzov with a look which , when the candle was lit , struck Toll by its cold severity . 
`` There can be no doubt about it , your Highness . '' 
`` Call him in , call him here . '' 
Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him . 
He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully , as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind . 
`` Tell me , tell me , friend , '' said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low , aged voice , as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest , `` come nearer -- nearer . 
What news have you brought me ? 
Eh ?
