The old man turned out to be a good story-teller on occasions , so that at last he became necessary to her . 
Grushenka saw scarcely anyone else beside Alyosha , who did not come every day and never stayed long . 
Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time , `` at his last gasp '' as they said in the town , and he did , in fact , die a week after Mitya 's trial . 
Three weeks before his death , feeling the end approaching , he made his sons , their wives and children , come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again . 
From that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came , `` The master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him . '' 
But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him . 
`` You 've come at last ! '' 
she cried , flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha , `` and Maximushka 's been scaring me that perhaps you would n't come . 
Ah , how I need you ! 
Sit down to the table .
