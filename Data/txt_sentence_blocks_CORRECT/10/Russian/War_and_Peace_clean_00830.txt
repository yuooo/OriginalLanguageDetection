Prokofy , the footman , who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind , sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges . 
He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement . 
`` Gracious heavens ! 
The young count ! '' 
he cried , recognizing his young master . 
`` Can it be ? 
My treasure ! '' 
and Prokofy , trembling with excitement , rushed toward the drawing-room door , probably in order to announce him , but , changing his mind , came back and stooped to kiss the young man 's shoulder . 
`` All well ? '' 
asked Rostov , drawing away his arm .
