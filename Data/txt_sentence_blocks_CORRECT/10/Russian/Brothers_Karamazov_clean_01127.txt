As soon as he wakes I 'll begin . 
I 'll pay you for the light , '' he said to the forester , `` for the night 's lodging , too ; you 'll remember Dmitri Karamazov . 
Only Father , I do n't know what we 're to do with you . 
Where will you sleep ? '' 
`` No , I 'm going home . 
I 'll take his horse and get home , '' he said , indicating the forester . 
`` And now I 'll say good-bye . 
I wish you all success . '' 
So it was settled . 
The priest rode off on the forester 's horse , delighted to escape , though he shook his head uneasily , wondering whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curious incident , `` or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it , be angry , and withdraw his favour .
