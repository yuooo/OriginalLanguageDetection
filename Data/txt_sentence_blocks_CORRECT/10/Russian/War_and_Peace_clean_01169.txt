Napoleon , without looking , pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them . 
Then he approached Lazarev -LRB- who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch -RRB- , looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally , and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lazarev 's buttons . 
It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier 's breast for the soldier to be forever happy , rewarded , and distinguished from everyone else in the world . 
Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev 's breast and , dropping his hand , turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there . 
And it really did . 
Officious hands , Russian and French , immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform . 
Lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and , still standing motionless presenting arms , looked again straight into Alexander 's eyes , as if asking whether he should stand there , or go away , or do something else . 
But receiving no orders , he remained for some time in that rigid position . 
The Emperors remounted and rode away . 
The Preobrazhensk battalion , breaking rank , mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them .
