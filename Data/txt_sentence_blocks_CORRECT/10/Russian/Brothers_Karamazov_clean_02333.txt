A thousand times perhaps he may , recalling his childhood , have driven away the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his father ! 
And what awaited him ? 
He was met by cynical taunts , suspicions and wrangling about money . 
He heard nothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy , and at last he saw his father seducing his mistress from him with his own money . 
Oh , gentlemen of the jury , that was cruel and revolting ! 
And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of his son . 
He slandered him in society , injured him , calumniated him , bought up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison . 
`` Gentlemen of the jury , people like my client , who are fierce , unruly , and uncontrolled on the surface , are sometimes , most frequently indeed , exceedingly tender-hearted , only they do n't express it . 
Do n't laugh , do n't laugh at my idea ! 
The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving Schiller - loving the sublime and beautiful !
