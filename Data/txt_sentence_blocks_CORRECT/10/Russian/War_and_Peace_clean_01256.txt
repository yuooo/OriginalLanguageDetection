`` Well , I wo n't marry , but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it . '' 
Natasha smiled and looked at her mother . 
`` Not to marry , but just so , '' she added . 
`` How so , my pet ? '' 
`` Just so . 
There 's no need for me to marry him . 
But ... just so . '' 
`` Just so , just so , '' repeated the countess , and shaking all over , she went off into a good humored , unexpected , elderly laugh . 
`` Do n't laugh , stop ! '' 
cried Natasha .
