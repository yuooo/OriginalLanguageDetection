`` Cut him down ! 
I command it ... '' shouted Rostopchin , suddenly growing pale like Vereshchagin . 
`` Draw sabers ! '' 
cried the dragoon officer , drawing his own . 
Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch . 
The tall youth , with a stony look on his face , and rigid and uplifted arm , stood beside Vereshchagin . 
`` Saber him ! '' 
the dragoon officer almost whispered . 
And one of the soldiers , his face all at once distorted with fury , struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber . 
`` Ah ! ''
