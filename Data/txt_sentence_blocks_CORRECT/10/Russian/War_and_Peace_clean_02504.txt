When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party , she had at first asked many questions : Where was he going ? 
How was he wounded ? 
Was it serious ? 
And could she see him ? 
But after she had been told that she could not see him , that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger , she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all , evidently disbelieving what they told her , and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same . 
All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes , and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much , and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving . 
She was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind . 
The countess knew this , but what it might be she did not know , and this alarmed and tormented her . 
`` Natasha , undress , darling ; lie down on my bed . '' 
A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only .
