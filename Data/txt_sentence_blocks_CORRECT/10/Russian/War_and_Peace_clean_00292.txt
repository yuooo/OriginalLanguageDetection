`` Well , may be ! '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Go , Masha ; I 'll come immediately . '' 
On the way to his sister 's room , in the passage which connected one wing with the other , Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly . 
It was the third time that day that , with an ecstatic and artless smile , she had met him in secluded passages . 
`` Oh ! 
I thought you were in your room , '' she said , for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes . 
Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face . 
He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair , without looking at her eyes , with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word . 
When he reached his sister 's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice , hurrying one word after another , came through the open door .
