`` How is it pointing ? '' 
asked Nicholas , riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare . 
But before the whip could reply , the hare , scenting the frost coming next morning , was unable to rest and leaped up . 
The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare , and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare . 
All the hunt , who had been moving slowly , shouted , `` Stop ! '' 
calling in the hounds , while the borzoi whips , with a cry of `` A-tu ! '' 
galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare . 
The tranquil Ilagin , Nicholas , Natasha , and `` Uncle '' flew , reckless of where and how they went , seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase . 
The hare they had started was a strong and swift one . 
When he jumped up he did not run at once , but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once .
