`` Yes , Lise , I have a secret one , too , '' answered Alyosha mournfully . 
`` I see you love me , since you guessed that . '' 
`` What grief ? 
What about ? 
Can you tell me ? '' 
asked Lise with timid entreaty . 
`` I 'll tell you later , Lise - afterwards , '' said Alyosha , confused . 
`` Now you would n't understand it perhaps - and perhaps I could n't explain it . '' 
`` I know your brothers and your father are worrying you , too . '' 
`` Yes , my brothers too , '' murmured Alyosha , pondering .
