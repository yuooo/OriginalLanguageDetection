The plague does not touch him . 
The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault . 
His childishly rash , uncalled-for , and ignoble departure from Africa , leaving his comrades in distress , is set down to his credit , and again the enemy 's fleet twice lets him slip past . 
When , intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully , he reaches Paris , the dissolution of the republican government , which a year earlier might have ruined him , has reached its extreme limit , and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him -- and though he himself has no plan , he is quite ready for his new role . 
He had no plan , he was afraid of everything , but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation . 
He alone -- with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and Egypt , his insane self-adulation , his boldness in crime and frankness in lying -- he alone could justify what had to be done . 
He is needed for the place that awaits him , and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision , his lack of a plan , and all his mistakes , he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success . 
He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature . 
In alarm he wishes to flee , considering himself lost . 
He pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him .
