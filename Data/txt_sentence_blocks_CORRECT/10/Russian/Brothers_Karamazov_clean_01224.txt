They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop . 
They had vivid recollections of how he had bought , three or four weeks ago , wine and goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles , paid for in cash -LRB- they would never have let him have anything on credit , of course -RRB- . 
They remembered that then , as now , he had had a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand , and had scattered them at random , without bargaining , without reflecting , or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be to him . 
The story was told all over the town that , driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe , he had `` spent three thousand in one night and the following day , and had come back from the spree without a penny . '' 
He had picked up a whole troop of gypsies -LRB- encamped in our neighbourhood at the time -RRB- , who for two days got money without stint out of him while he was drunk , and drank expensive wine without stint . 
People used to tell , laughing at Mitya , how he had given champagne to grimy-handed peasants , and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies . 
Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a risky proceeding , there was much laughter behind his back , especially in the tavern , at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of Grushenka by this `` escapade '' was `` permission to kiss her foot , and that was the utmost she had allowed him . '' 
By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop , they found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells , and with Andrey , the driver , ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance . 
In the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions , and were only waiting for Mitya 's arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded .
