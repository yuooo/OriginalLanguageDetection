-- that is , wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension . 
The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who , recognizing the defects of paper money , decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold . 
It may indeed make jingling coin , but will do no more than that . 
Paper money may deceive the ignorant , but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle . 
As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use , so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history 's essential question : what is power ? 
The universal historians give contradictory replies to that question , while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different . 
And as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold , or among those who do not know the nature of gold , so universal historians and historians of culture , not answering humanity 's essential question , serve as currency for some purposes of their own , only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call `` serious reading . '' 
Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man 's will to the Deity , history can not without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things : either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed `` power . '' 
A return to the first is impossible , the belief has been destroyed ; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power . 
Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war .
