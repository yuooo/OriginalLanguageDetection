She could understand nothing , think of nothing and feel nothing , except passionate love for her father , love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment . 
She ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond , along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted . 
`` Yes ... I. . . 
I. . . 
I wished for his death ! 
Yes , I wanted it to end quicker ... . 
I wished to be at peace ... . 
And what will become of me ? 
What use will peace be when he is no longer here ? '' 
Princess Mary murmured , pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs .
