He sighed . 
`` He is dozing , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna , observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching . 
`` Let us go . '' 
Pierre went out . 
There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasili and the eldest princess , who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly . 
As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent , and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered : `` I ca n't bear the sight of that woman . '' 
`` Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room , '' said Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna . 
`` Go and take something , my poor Anna Mikhaylovna , or you will not hold out . '' 
To Pierre he said nothing , merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder . 
Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the small drawing room .
