She told about her father and her going to Mitya , and did not in one word , in a single hint , suggest that Mitya had himself , through her sister , proposed they should `` send him Katerina Ivanovna '' to fetch the money . 
She generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the young officer , relying on something ... to beg him for the money . 
It was something tremendous ! 
I turned cold and trembled as I listened . 
The court was hushed , trying to catch each word . 
It was something unexampled . 
Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was , such an extremely frank avowal , such sacrifice , such self-immolation , seemed incredible . 
And for what , for whom ? 
To save the man who had deceived and insulted her and to help , in however small a degree , in saving him , by creating a strong impression in his favour . 
And , indeed , the figure of the young officer who , with a respectful bow to the innocent girl , handed her his last four thousand roubles - all he had in the world - was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light , but ... I had a painful misgiving at heart !
