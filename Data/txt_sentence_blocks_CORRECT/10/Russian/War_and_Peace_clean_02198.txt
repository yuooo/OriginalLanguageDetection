was a prisoner , and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes , for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin , sallow-faced , perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand , shouting something . 
Instinctively guarding against the shock -- for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one another -- Pierre put out his hands and seized the man -LRB- a French officer -RRB- by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other . 
The officer , dropping his sword , seized Pierre by his collar . 
For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another 's unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next . 
`` Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner ? '' 
each was thinking . 
But the French officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre 's strong hand , impelled by instinctive fear , squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter . 
The Frenchman was about to say something , when just above their heads , terrible and low , a cannon ball whistled , and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer 's head had been torn off , so swiftly had he ducked it . 
Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall . 
Without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner , the Frenchman ran back to the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who , it seemed to him , caught at his feet .
