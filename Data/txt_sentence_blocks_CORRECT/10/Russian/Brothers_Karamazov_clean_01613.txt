At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling , or would investigate the state of his boots , or would shout angrily for `` Perezvon , '' the big , shaggy , mangy dog , which he had picked up a month before , brought home , and kept for some reason secretly indoors , not showing him to any of his schoolfellows . 
He bullied him frightfully , teaching him all sorts of tricks , so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he was absent at school , and when he came in , whined with delight , rushed about as if he were crazy , begged , lay down on the ground pretending to be dead , and so on ; in fact , showed all the tricks he had taught him , not at the word of command , but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful heart . 
I have forgotten , by the way , to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov . 
Ilusha had been defending his father when the schoolboys jeered at him , shouting the nickname `` wisp of tow . '' 
Children AND so on that frosty , snowy , and windy day in November , Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home . 
It was Sunday and there was no school . 
It had just struck eleven , and he particularly wanted to go out `` on very urgent business , '' but he was left alone in charge of the house , for it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and singular event . 
Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms , separated from the rest of the house by a passage , to a doctor 's wife with her two small children . 
This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna , and a great friend of hers . 
Her husband , the doctor , had taken his departure twelve months before , going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend , and for the last six months she had not heard a word from him .
