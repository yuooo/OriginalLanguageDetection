The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile and wagged his head approvingly . 
`` Well , good-by , your excellency , keep well ! '' 
said Rostopchin , getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince . 
`` Good-by , my dear fellow ... . 
His words are music , I never tire of hearing him ! '' 
said the old prince , keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed . 
Following Rostopchin 's example the others also rose . 
Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men 's talk and faultfinding , understood nothing of what she heard ; she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her father 's hostile attitude toward her . 
She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Boris Drubetskoy , who was visiting them for the third time already . 
Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre , who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room .
