laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness . 
`` He 's a smart lad , '' said an hussar standing near Petya . 
`` We gave him something to eat a while ago . 
He was awfully hungry ! '' 
The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness , and the drummer boy came to the door . 
`` Ah , c'est vous ! '' 
said Petya . 
`` Voulez-vous manger ? 
N'ayez pas peur , on ne vous fera pas de mal , '' * he added shyly and affectionately , touching the boy 's hand . 
`` Entrez , entrez . ''
