Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca , which was described by Crosart , a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform .

Count Rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital , but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening , and that had he known it sooner things would have been different ... .

It would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible , but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment .
