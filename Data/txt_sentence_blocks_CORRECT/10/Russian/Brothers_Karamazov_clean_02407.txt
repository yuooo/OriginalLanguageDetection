`` Listen : I ca n't go with you to the funeral now . 
I 've sent them flowers . 
I think they still have money . 
If necessary , tell them I 'll never abandon them ... . 
Now leave me , leave me , please . 
You are late as it is - the bells are ringing for the service ... . 
Leave me , please ! ''
