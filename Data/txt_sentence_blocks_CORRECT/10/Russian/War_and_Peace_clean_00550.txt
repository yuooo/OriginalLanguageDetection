Spread out the cloak , Antonov . '' 
The cadet was Rostov . 
With one hand he supported the other ; he was pale and his jaw trembled , shivering feverishly . 
He was placed on `` Matvevna , '' the gun from which they had removed the dead officer . 
The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm . 
`` What , are you wounded , my lad ? '' 
said Tushin , approaching the gun on which Rostov sat . 
`` No , it 's a sprain . '' 
`` Then what is this blood on the gun carriage ? '' 
inquired Tushin .
