And you will have to take a wife , too . 
You will have to bear all before you come back . 
There will be much to do . 
But I do n't doubt of you , and so I send you forth . 
Christ is with you . 
Do not abandon Him and He will not abandon you . 
You will see great sorrow , and in that sorrow you will be happy . 
This is my last message to you : in sorrow seek happiness . 
Work , work unceasingly . 
Remember my words , for although I shall talk with you again , not only my days but my hours are numbered . ''
