The word had almost escaped me , had almost broken from my lips ... you know how susceptible and aesthetically impressionable I am . 
But common sense - oh , a most unhappy trait in my character - kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass ! 
For what would have happened , I reflected , what would have happened after my hosannah ? 
Everything on earth would have been extinguished at once and no events could have occurred . 
And so , solely from a sense of duty and my social position , was forced to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task . 
Somebody takes all the credit of what 's good for Himself , and nothing but nastiness is left for me . 
But I do n't envy the honour of a life of idle imposture , I am not ambitious . 
Why am I , of all creatures in the world , doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be kicked , for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences sometimes ? 
I know , of course , there 's a secret in it , but they wo n't tell me the secret for anything , for then perhaps , seeing the meaning of it , I might bawl hosannah , and the indispensable minus would disappear at once , and good sense would reign supreme throughout the whole world . 
And that , of course , would mean the end of everything , even of magazines and newspapers , for who would take them in ?
