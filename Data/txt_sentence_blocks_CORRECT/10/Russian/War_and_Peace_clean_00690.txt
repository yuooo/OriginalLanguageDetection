Our stories have some weight , not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything ! '' 
`` Of whom you imagine me to be one ? '' 
said Prince Andrew , with a quiet and particularly amiable smile . 
A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man 's self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov 's soul . 
`` I am not talking about you , '' he said , `` I do n't know you and , frankly , I do n't want to . 
I am speaking of the staff in general . '' 
`` And I will tell you this , '' Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority , `` you wish to insult me , and I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you have n't sufficient self-respect , but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen . 
In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel , and besides , Drubetskoy , who says he is an old friend of yours , is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you . 
However , '' he added rising , `` you know my name and where to find me , but do n't forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted , and as a man older than you , my advice is to let the matter drop . 
Well then , on Friday after the review I shall expect you , Drubetskoy .
