You see , you must watch his beard ; he has a nasty , thin , red beard . 
If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross , it 's all right , he is saying what he means , he wants to do business . 
But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins - he is trying to cheat you . 
Do n't watch his eyes , you wo n't find out anything from his eyes , he is a deep one , a rogue but watch his beard ! 
I 'll give you a note and you show it to him . 
He 's called Gorstkin , though his real name is Lyagavy ; * but do n't call him so , he will be offended . 
If you come to an understanding with him , and see it 's all right , write here at once . 
You need only write : ` He 's not lying . ' 
Stand out for eleven thousand ; one thousand you can knock off , but not more . 
just think !
