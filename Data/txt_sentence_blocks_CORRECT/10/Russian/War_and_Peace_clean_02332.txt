The countess had fallen asleep and the count , having put off their departure till next morning , went to bed . 
Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing . 
That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya , and Mavra Kuzminichna , who was standing at the gate , had him brought into the Rostovs ' yard . 
Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man . 
He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood , and was quite covered by an apron . 
On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant . 
A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart . 
`` Please come in here . 
The masters are going away and the whole house will be empty , '' said the old woman to the old attendant . 
`` Well , perhaps , '' said he with a sigh .
