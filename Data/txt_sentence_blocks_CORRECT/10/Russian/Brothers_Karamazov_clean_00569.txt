Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna 's must dominate , and she could only dominate someone like Dmitri , and never a man like Ivan . 
For Dmitri might - at last submit to her domination `` to his own happiness '' -LRB- which was what Alyosha would have desired -RRB- , but Ivan - no , Ivan could not submit to her , and such submission would not give him happiness . 
Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan . 
And now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing-room . 
Another idea , too , forced itself upon him : `` What if she loved neither of them - neither Ivan nor Dmitri ? '' 
It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month . 
`` What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions ? '' 
he thought reproachfully , after such doubts and surmises . 
And yet it was impossible not to think about it . 
He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his brothers ' lives and that a great deal depended upon it .
