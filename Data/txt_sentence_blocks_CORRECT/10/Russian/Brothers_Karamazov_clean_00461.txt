`` Go away ! 
You 're a creature for sale '' screamed Katerina Ivanovna . 
Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face . 
`` For sale indeed ! 
You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once ; you brought your beauty for sale . 
You see , I know . '' 
Katerina Ivanovna shrieked , and would have rushed at her , but Alyosha held her with all his strength . 
`` Not a step , not a word ! 
Do n't speak , do n't answer her . 
She 'll go away - she 'll go at once . ''
