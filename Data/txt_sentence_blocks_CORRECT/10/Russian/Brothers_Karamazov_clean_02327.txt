Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both ? 
But , excuse me , conscience implies penitence , and the suicide may not have felt penitence , but only despair . 
Despair and penitence are two very different things . 
Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable , and the suicide , laying his hands on himself , may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had envied all his life . 
`` Gentlemen of the jury , beware of a miscarriage of justice ! 
What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now ? 
Find the error in my reasoning ; find the impossibility , the absurdity . 
And if there is but a shade of possibility , but a shade of probability in my propositions , do not condemn him . 
And is there only a shade ? 
I swear by all that is sacred , I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward .
