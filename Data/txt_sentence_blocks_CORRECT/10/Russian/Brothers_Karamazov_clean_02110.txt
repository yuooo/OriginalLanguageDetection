I like her ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow . 
I am more afraid of her than of anything . 
On account of the future . 
She will cast me off to-morrow and trample me under foot . 
She thinks that I am ruining Mitya from jealousy on her account ! 
Yes , she thinks that ! 
But it 's not so . 
To-morrow the cross , but not the gallows . 
No , I sha n't hang myself . 
Do you know , I can never commit suicide , Alyosha .
