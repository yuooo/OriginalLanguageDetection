Wealth and poverty , fame and obscurity , power and subordination , strength and weakness , health and disease , culture and ignorance , work and leisure , repletion and hunger , virtue and vice , are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom . 
A man having no freedom can not be conceived of except as deprived of life . 
If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time , or of an effect without a cause , that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason . 
This unshakable , irrefutable consciousness of freedom , uncontrolled by experiment or argument , recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception , this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question . 
Man is the creation of an all-powerful , all-good , and all-seeing God . 
What is sin , the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man 's freedom ? 
That is a question for theology . 
The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics . 
What is man 's responsibility to society , the conception of which results from the conception of freedom ? 
That is a question for jurisprudence .
