After the rapture of meeting , and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied expectation -- the feeling that `` everything is just the same , so why did I hurry ? '' 
-- Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world . 
His father and mother were much the same , only a little older . 
What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord , which there used not to be , and which , as Nicholas soon found out , was due to the bad state of their affairs . 
Sonya was nearly twenty ; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already , but that was enough . 
She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned , and the faithful , unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him . 
Petya and Natasha surprised Nicholas most . 
Petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen , merry , witty , and mischievous , with a voice that was already breaking . 
As for Natasha , for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her . 
`` You 're not the same at all , '' he said .
