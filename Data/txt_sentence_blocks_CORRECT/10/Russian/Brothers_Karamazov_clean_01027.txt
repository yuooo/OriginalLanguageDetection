It was not that she lent money on interest , but it was known , for instance , that she had for some time past , in partnership with old Karamazov , actually invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle , a tenth of their nominal value , and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value . 
The old widower Samsonov , a man of large fortune , was stingy and merciless . 
He tyrannised over his grown-up sons , but , for the last year during which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs , he had fallen greatly under the influence of his protegee , whom he had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings , `` on Lenten fare , '' as the wits said at the time . 
But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself , while she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity . 
The old man , now long since dead , had had a large business in his day and was also a noteworthy character , miserly and hard as flint . 
Though Grushenka 's hold upon him was so strong that he could not live without her -LRB- it had been so especially for the last two years -RRB- , he did not settle any considerable fortune on her and would not have been moved to do so , if she had threatened to leave him . 
But he had presented her with a small sum , and even that was a surprise to everyone when it became known . 
`` You are a wench with brains , '' he said to her , when he gave her eight thousand roubles , `` and you must look after yourself , but let me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before , you 'll get nothing more from me to the day of my death , and I 'll leave you nothing in my will either . '' 
And he kept his word ; he died and left everything to his sons , whom , with their wives and children , he had treated all his life as servants . 
Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will .
