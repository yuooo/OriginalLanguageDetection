Only a man who has experienced it -- that is , has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war -- can understand the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the army 's foraging operations , provision trains , and hospitals . 
When - free from soldiers , wagons , and the filthy traces of a camp -- he saw villages with peasants and peasant women , gentlemen 's country houses , fields where cattle were grazing , posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them , he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time . 
What for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women , young and healthy , without a dozen officers making up to each of them ; women , too , who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them . 
In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Voronezh , ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp , and next day , very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long time , went to present himself to the authorities . 
The commander of the militia was a civilian general , an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank . 
He received Nicholas brusquely -LRB- imagining this to be characteristically military -RRB- and questioned him with an important air , as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so . 
Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him . 
From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor . 
The governor was a brisk little man , very simple and affable . 
He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses , recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses , and promised to assist him in every way .
