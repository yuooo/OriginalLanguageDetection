Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by Lauriston , saying that there could be no question of peace . 
Soon after that a report was received from Dorokhov 's guerrilla detachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of Broussier 's division had been seen at Forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed . 
The soldiers and officers again demanded action . 
Generals on the staff , excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tarutino , urged Kutuzov to carry out Dorokhov 's suggestion . 
Kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary . 
The result was a compromise which was inevitable : a small detachment was sent to Forminsk to attack Broussier . 
By a strange coincidence , this task , which turned out to be a most difficult and important one , was entrusted to Dokhturov -- that same modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles , dashing about in front of regiments , showering crosses on batteries , and so on , and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning -- but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813 . 
At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd dam , rallying the regiments , saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard . 
Ill with fever he went to Smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon 's whole army . 
In Smolensk , at the Malakhov Gate , he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town -- and Smolensk held out all day long .
