`` Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov ! '' 
said Napoleon . 
`` We shall see ! 
Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments ... . 
We shall see ! '' 
He looked at his watch . 
It was still only four o'clock . 
He did not feel sleepy . 
The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do . 
He rose , walked to and fro , put on a warm overcoat and a hat , and went out of the tent .
