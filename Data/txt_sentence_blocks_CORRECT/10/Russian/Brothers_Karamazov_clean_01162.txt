`` Yes it is , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , just what you need ; the very thing you 're yearning for , though you do n't realise it yourself . 
I am not at all opposed to the present woman movement , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
The development of woman , and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future - that 's my ideal .

Persevere . '

I thought of signing myself ' A contemporary Mother , ' and hesitated , but I stuck to the simple ` Mother ' ; there 's more moral beauty in that , Dmitri Fyodorovitch .
