I am a wretch , but I love Thee . 
If Thou sendest me to hell , I shall love Thee there , and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever ... . 
But let me love to the end ... . 
Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I love her and I can not help loving her . 
Thou seest my whole heart ... I shall gallop up , I shall fall before her and say , ` You are right to pass on and leave me . 
Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me ! ' '' 
`` Mokroe ! '' 
cried Andrey , pointing ahead with his whip . 
Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of buildings , flung down , as it were , in the vast plain . 
The village of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants , but at that hour all were asleep , and only here and there a few lights still twinkled .
