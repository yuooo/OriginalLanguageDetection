She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street . 
Someone stopped at the gate , and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it . 
Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate . 
`` Who do you want ? '' 
`` The count -- Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov . '' 
`` And who are you ? '' 
`` An officer , I have to see him , '' came the reply in a pleasant , well-bred Russian voice . 
Mavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen , with the round face of a Rostov , entered the yard . 
`` They have gone away , sir . 
Went away yesterday at vespertime , '' said Mavra Kuzminichna cordially .
