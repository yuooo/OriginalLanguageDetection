The man who had devastated France returns to France alone , without any conspiracy and without soldiers . 
Any guard might arrest him , but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later . 
This man is still needed to justify the final collective act . 
That act is performed . 
The last role is played . 
The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint : he will not be wanted any more . 
And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island , justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed , and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions . 
The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us . 
`` See what you believed in ! 
This is he !
