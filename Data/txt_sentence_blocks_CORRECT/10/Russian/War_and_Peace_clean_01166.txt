Napoleon 's face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile . 
Alexander was saying something affable to him . 
In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes ' horses , which were pushing back the crowd , Rostov kept his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte . 
It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar , as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to him . 
Alexander and Napoleon , with the long train of their suites , approached the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there . 
The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the Emperors that Rostov , standing in the front row , was afraid he might be recognized . 
`` Sire , I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest of your soldiers , '' said a sharp , precise voice , articulating every letter . 
This was said by the undersized Napoleon , looking up straight into Alexander 's eyes . 
Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and , bending his head , smiled pleasantly . 
`` To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war , '' added Napoleon , accentuating each syllable , as with a composure and assurance exasperating to Rostov , he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up before him , who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor .
