Here , this way ! '' 
But Pierre was not listening to the woman . 
He had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away . 
He was looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them . 
One of these , a nimble little man , was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope . 
He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare . 
The other , whose appearance particularly struck Pierre , was a long , lank , round-shouldered , fair-haired man , slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face . 
He wore a woman 's loose gown of frieze , blue trousers , and large torn Hessian boots . 
The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and , saying something , immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots . 
The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her , motionless and silent .
