With the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house , taking up now one occupation , now another , and at once abandoning them . 
Hard as it was for Sonya , she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight . 
The day before the count was to return , Sonya noticed that Natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past , whom Sonya took to be Anatole . 
Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state . 
She answered questions at random , began sentences she did not finish , and laughed at everything . 
After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha 's door timidly waiting to let her pass . 
She let the girl go in , and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered . 
Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening . 
Sonya knocked at her door . 
Natasha did not let her in .
