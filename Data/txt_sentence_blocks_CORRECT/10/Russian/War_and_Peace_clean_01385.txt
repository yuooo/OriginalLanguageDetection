he shouted , answering `` Uncle 's '' remark by this call to his borzoi . 
Karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl , famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided . 
They all took up their places . 
The old count , knowing his son 's ardor in the hunt , hurried so as not to be late , and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ilya Rostov , cheerful , flushed , and with quivering cheeks , drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him , where a wolf might come out . 
Having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn , he mounted his good , sleek , well-fed , and comfortable horse , Viflyanka , which was turning gray , like himself . 
His horses and trap were sent home . 
Count Ilya Rostov , though not at heart a keen sportsman , knew the rules of the hunt well , and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand , arranged his reins , settled himself in the saddle , and , feeling that he was ready , looked about with a smile . 
Beside him was Simon Chekmar , his personal attendant , an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle . 
Chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds , who had , however , grown fat like their master and his horse . 
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed .
