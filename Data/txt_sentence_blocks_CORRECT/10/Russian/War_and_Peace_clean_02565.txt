On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to Kutuzov with the following rescript : Prince Michael Ilarionovich ! 
Since the twenty-ninth of August I have received no communication from you , yet on the first of September I received from the commander in chief of Moscow , via Yaroslavl , the sad news that you , with the army , have decided to abandon Moscow . 
You can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me , and your silence increases my astonishment . 
I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski , to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision . 
Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow , a messenger from Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event . 
This messenger was Michaud , a Frenchman who did not know Russian , but who was quoique etranger , russe de coeur et d'ame , * as he said of himself . 
* Though a foreigner , Russian in heart and soul . 
The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on Stone Island . 
Michaud , who had never seen Moscow before the campaign and who did not know Russian , yet felt deeply moved -LRB- as he wrote -RRB- when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain * with the news of the burning of Moscow , dont les flammes eclairaient sa route . 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- * Our most gracious sovereign .
