Wait ! '' 
he shouted . 
The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against Pierre . 
`` Eh , sir , this is no place for you , '' said he , and ran down the slope . 
Pierre ran after him , avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting . 
One cannon ball , another , and a third flew over him , falling in front , beside , and behind him . 
Pierre ran down the slope . 
`` Where am I going ? '' 
he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons . 
He halted irresolutely , not knowing whether to return or go on .
