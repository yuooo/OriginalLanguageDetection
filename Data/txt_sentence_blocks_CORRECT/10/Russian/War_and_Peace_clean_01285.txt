And such was Natasha , with her surprise , her delight , her shyness , and even her mistakes in speaking French . 
With her he behaved with special care and tenderness , sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters ; he admired her shy grace . 
In the middle of the cotillion , having completed one of the figures , Natasha , still out of breath , was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her . 
She was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining , but immediately put her hand gaily on the man 's shoulder , smiling at Prince Andrew . 
`` I 'd be glad to sit beside you and rest : I 'm tired ; but you see how they keep asking me , and I 'm glad of it , I 'm happy and I love everybody , and you and I understand it all , '' and much , much more was said in her smile . 
When her partner left her Natasha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure . 
`` If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady , she will be my wife , '' said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise , as he watched her . 
She did go first to her cousin . 
`` What rubbish sometimes enters one 's head ! '' 
thought Prince Andrew , `` but what is certain is that that girl is so charming , so original , that she wo n't be dancing here a month before she will be married ... .
