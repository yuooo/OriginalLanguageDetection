Everywhere in these days men have , in their mockery , ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort . 
But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end , and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another . 
It will be the spirit of the time , and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light . 
And then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens ... . 
But , until then , we must keep the banner flying . 
Sometimes even if he has to do it alone , and his conduct seems to be crazy , a man must set an example , and so draw men 's souls out of their solitude , and spur them to some act of brotherly love , that the great idea may not die . '' 
Our evenings , one after another , were spent in such stirring and fervent talk . 
I gave up society and visited my neighbours much less frequently . 
Besides , my vogue was somewhat over . 
I say this , not as blame , for they still loved me and treated me good-humouredly , but there 's no denying that fashion is a great power in society .
