At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past , and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had brought them together again , but after that they never spoke of the future . 
`` Can it or can it not be ? '' 
he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles . 
`` Can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die ? 
... Is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity ? 
I love her more than anything in the world ! 
But what am I to do if I love her ? '' 
he thought , and he involuntarily groaned , from a habit acquired during his sufferings .
