`` Where is he ? '' 
he inquired . 
And as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons . 
He had a long thin neck , and his head , that had been half shaved , was again covered by short hair . 
This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur , that had once been smart , and dirty hempen convict trousers , over which were pulled his thin , dirty , trodden-down boots . 
On his thin , weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Rostopchin , hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch . 
`` Put him there . '' 
The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated , holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck , turned his long neck twice this way and that , sighed , and submissively folded before him his thin hands , unused to work .
