Nina , too , broke into sobs . 
Kolya ran out of the room , the boys followed him . 
At last Alyosha too went out . 
`` Let them weep , '' he said to Kolya , `` it 's no use trying to comfort them just now . 
Let wait a minute and then go back . '' 
`` No , it 's no use , it 's awful , '' Kolya assented . 
`` Do you know , Karamazov , '' he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them , `` I feel dreadfully sad , and if it were only possible to bring him back , I 'd give anything in the world to do it . '' 
`` Ah , so would I , '' said Alyosha . 
`` What do you think , Karamazov ? 
Had we better come back here to-night ?
