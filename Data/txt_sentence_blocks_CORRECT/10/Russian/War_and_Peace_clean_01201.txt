The day after his interview with Count Arakcheev , Prince Andrew spent the evening at Count Kochubey 's . 
He told the count of his interview with Sila Andreevich -LRB- Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by that nickname with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of War 's anteroom -RRB- . 
`` Mon cher , even in this case you ca n't do without Michael Mikhaylovich Speranski . 
He manages everything . 
I 'll speak to him . 
He has promised to come this evening . '' 
`` What has Speranski to do with the army regulations ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
Kochubey shook his head smilingly , as if surprised at Bolkonski 's simplicity . 
`` We were talking to him about you a few days ago , '' Kochubey continued , `` and about your freed plowmen . ''
