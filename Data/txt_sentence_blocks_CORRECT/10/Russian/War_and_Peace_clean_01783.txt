He was followed by Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein , and the door closed behind them . 
Prince Andrew , taking advantage of the Emperor 's permission , accompanied Paulucci , whom he had known in Turkey , into the drawing room where the council was assembled . 
Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position , as it were , of chief of the Emperor 's staff . 
He came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table , and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present . 
What had happened was that news -LRB- which afterwards proved to be false -RRB- had been received during the night of a movement by the French to outflank the Drissa camp . 
The first to speak was General Armfeldt who , to meet the difficulty that presented itself , unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads . 
The reason for this was inexplicable -LRB- unless he wished to show that he , too , could have an opinion -RRB- , but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy . 
It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put -- which , in fact , his plan did not answer - as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it . 
It was one of the millions of proposals , one as good as another , that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take . 
Some disputed his arguments , others defended them .
