Listen , it was I caught you , not you me . 
I told you your anecdote you 'd forgotten , on purpose , so as to destroy your faith in me completely . '' 
`` You are lying . 
The object of your visit is to convince me of your existence ! '' 
`` Just so . 
But hesitation , suspense , conflict between belief and disbelief - is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man , such as you are , that it 's better to hang oneself at once . 
Knowing that you are inclined to believe in me , I administered some disbelief by telling you that anecdote . 
I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns , and I have my motive in it . 
It 's the new method . 
As soon as you disbelieve in me completely , you 'll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream but a reality .
