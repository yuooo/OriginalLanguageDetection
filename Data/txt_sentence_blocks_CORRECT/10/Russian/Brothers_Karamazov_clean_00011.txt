There is very little doubt that she would not on any account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time . 
But she lived in another province ; besides , what could a little girl of sixteen know about it , except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress . 
So the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a penny this time , for the general 's widow was furious . 
She gave them nothing and cursed them both . 
But he had not reckoned on a dowry ; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl , above all her innocent appearance , which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious profligate , who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine beauty . 
`` Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor , '' he used to say afterwards , with his loathsome snigger . 
In a man so depraved this might , of course , mean no more than sensual attraction . 
As he had received no dowry with his wife , and had , so to speak , taken her `` from the halter , '' he did not stand on ceremony with her . 
Making her feel that she had `` wronged '' him , he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage .
