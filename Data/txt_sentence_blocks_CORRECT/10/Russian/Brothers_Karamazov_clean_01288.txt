`` Why are we sitting here though , gentlemen ? 
Why do n't you begin doing something ? '' 
his smiling eyes seemed to ask . 
`` He keeps talking nonsense , and we were all laughing , '' Kalgonov began suddenly , as though divining his thought , and pointing to Maximov . 
Mitya immediately stared at Kalgonov and then at Maximov `` He 's talking nonsense ? '' 
he laughed , his short , wooden laugh , seeming suddenly delighted at something - `` ha ha ! '' 
`` Yes . 
Would you believe it , he will have it that all our cavalry officers in the twenties married Polish women . 
That 's awful rot , is n't it ? ''
