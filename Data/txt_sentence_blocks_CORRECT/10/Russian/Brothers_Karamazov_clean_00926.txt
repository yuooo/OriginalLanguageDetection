`` What are you saying ? '' 
I cried . 
`` You see , '' he said , with a pale smile , `` how much it has cost me to say the first word . 
Now I have said it , I feel I 've taken the first step and shall go on . '' 
For a long while I could not believe him , and I did not believe him at that time , but only after he had been to see me three days running and told me all about it . 
I thought he was mad , but ended by being convinced , to my great grief and amazement . 
His crime was a great and terrible one . 
Fourteen years before , he had murdered the widow of a landowner , a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in our town . 
He fell passionately in love with her , declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry him . 
But she had already given her heart to another man , an officer of noble birth and high rank in the service , who was at that time away at the front , though she was expecting him soon to return .
