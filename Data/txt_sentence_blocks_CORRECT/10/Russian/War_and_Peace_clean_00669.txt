`` From all he says one should be glad and not cry . '' 
This was quite true , but the count , the countess , and Natasha looked at her reproachfully . 
`` And who is it she takes after ? '' 
thought the countess . 
Nicholas ' letter was read over hundreds of times , and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess , for she did not let it out of her hands . 
The tutors came , and the nurses , and Dmitri , and several acquaintances , and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nikolenka 's virtues . 
How strange , how extraordinary , how joyful it seemed , that her son , the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her , that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count , that son who had first learned to say `` pear '' and then `` granny , '' that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings , a manly warrior doing some kind of man 's work of his own , without help or guidance . 
The universal experience of ages , showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood , did not exist for the countess . 
Her son 's growth toward manhood , at each of its stages , had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way . 
As twenty years before , it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry , suck her breast , and begin to speak , so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong , brave man , this model son and officer that , judging by this letter , he now was .
