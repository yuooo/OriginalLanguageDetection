But there happened to be some other boys in the place with whom he soon made friends . 
Some of them were living at the station , others in the neighbourhood ; there were six or seven of them , all between twelve and fifteen , and two of them came from our town . 
The boys played together , and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya 's stay at the station , a mad bet was made by the foolish boys . 
Kolya , who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence , was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due , and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed . 
It is true they made a preliminary investigation , from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without touching , but to lie there was no joke ! 
Kolya maintained stoutly that he would . 
At first they laughed at him , called him a little liar , a braggart , but that only egged him on . 
What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously , and were at first disposed to treat him as `` a small boy , '' not fit to associate with them , and that was an unendurable insult . 
And so it was resolved to go in the evening , half a mile from the station , so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station The boys assembled . 
It was a pitch-dark night without a moon .
