`` Do you suppose , gentlemen , that our children as they grow up and begin to reason can avoid such questions ? 
No , they can not , and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction . 
The sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature , especially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his companions . 
The conventional answer to this question is : ` He begot you , and you are his flesh and blood , and therefore you are bound to love him . ' 
The youth involuntarily reflects : ` But did he love me when he begot me ? ' 
he asks , wondering more and more . 
` Was it for my sake he begot me ? 
He did not know me , not even my sex , at that moment , at the moment of passion , perhaps , inflamed by wine , and he has only transmitted to me a propensity to drunkenness - that 's all he 's done for me ... . 
Why am I bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my life after ? ' 
`` Oh , perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel , but do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind .
