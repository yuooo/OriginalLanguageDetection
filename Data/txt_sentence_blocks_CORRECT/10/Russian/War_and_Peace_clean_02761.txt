On Konovnitsyn 's handsome , resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever , there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs , but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance . 
`` Well , what is it ? 
From whom ? '' 
he asked immediately but without hurry , blinking at the light . 
While listening to the officer 's report Konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch . 
Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots . 
Then he took off his nightcap , combed his hair over his temples , and donned his cap . 
`` Did you get here quickly ? 
Let us go to his Highness . '' 
Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost .
