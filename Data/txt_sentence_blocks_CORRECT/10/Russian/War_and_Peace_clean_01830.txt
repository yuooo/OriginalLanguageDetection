The countess looked round several times at her daughter 's softened face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her . 
Unexpectedly , in the middle of the service , and not in the usual order Natasha knew so well , the deacon brought out a small stool , the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday , and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen . 
The priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head , adjusted his hair , and knelt down with an effort . 
Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise . 
Then came the prayer just received from the Synod -- a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion . 
`` Lord God of might , God of our salvation ! '' 
began the priest in that voice , clear , not grandiloquent but mild , in which only the Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart . 
`` Lord God of might , God of our salvation ! 
Look this day in mercy and blessing on Thy humble people , and graciously hear us , spare us , and have mercy upon us ! 
This foe confounding Thy land , desiring to lay waste the whole world , rises against us ; these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom , to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem , Thy beloved Russia ; to defile Thy temples , to overthrow Thine altars , and to desecrate our holy shrines .
