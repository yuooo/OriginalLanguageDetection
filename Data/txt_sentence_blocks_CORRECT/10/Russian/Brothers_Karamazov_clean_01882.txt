I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him out of the house . 
And he had written this doggerel . 
` It 's the first time I 've soiled my hands with writing poetry , ' he said . 
` It 's to win her heart , so it 's in a good cause . 
When I get hold of the silly woman 's fortune , I can be of great social utility . ' 
They have this social justification for every nasty thing they do ! 
` Anyway it 's better than your Pushkin 's poetry , ' he said , ` for I 've managed to advocate enlightenment even in that . ' 
I understand what he means about Pushkin , I quite see that , if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about women 's feet . 
But was n't Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel ! 
The vanity of these fellows !
