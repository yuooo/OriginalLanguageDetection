He noticed her watching him , raised his eyes , and began to speak seriously : `` One thing would be terrible , '' said he : `` to bind oneself forever to a suffering man . 
It would be continual torture . '' 
And he looked searchingly at her . 
Natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say . 
She said : `` This ca n't go on -- it wo n't . 
You will get well -- quite well . '' 
She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt . 
She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze . 
`` I agreed , '' Natasha now said to herself , `` that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer .
