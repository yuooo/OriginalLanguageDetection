Alyosha went , opened the door , and reported that no one was listening . 
`` Come here , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' Lise went on , flushing redder and redder . 
`` Give me your hand - that 's right . 
I have to make a great confession . 
I did n't write to you yesterday in joke , but in earnest , '' and she hid her eyes with her hand . 
It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession . 
Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times . 
`` Ah , Lise , what a good thing ! '' 
cried Alyosha joyfully . 
`` You know , I was perfectly sure you were in earnest . ''
