The Grand Master rapped with his mallet . 
All the Masons sat down in their places , and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility . 
The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed , and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of `` Collector of Alms '' went round to all the brothers . 
Pierre would have liked to subscribe all he had , but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the others . 
The meeting was at an end , and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years , had become completely changed , and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life . 
The day after he had been received into the Lodge , Pierre was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square , one side of which symbolized God , another moral things , a third physical things , and the fourth a combination of these . 
Now and then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life . 
On the previous evening at the Lodge , he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg . 
Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs . 
He was joyfully planning this new life , when Prince Vasili suddenly entered the room .
