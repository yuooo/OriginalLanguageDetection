Oh , what a lovely boy ! '' 
The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room , where Sonya was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
The countess caressed the boy , and the old count came in and welcomed the princess . 
He had changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him . 
Then he had been a brisk , cheerful , self-assured old man ; now he seemed a pitiful , bewildered person . 
While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing . 
After the destruction of Moscow and of his property , thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life . 
In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible , and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew , the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting , for a time , to this new order of things which she had entered . 
She knew it to be necessary , and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people . 
`` This is my niece , '' said the count , introducing Sonya -- `` You do n't know her , Princess ? ''
