As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face , lighting up both her sorrow and her joy . 
`` There is one thing I wanted to tell you , Princess , '' said Rostov . 
`` It is that if your brother , Prince Andrew Nikolievich , were not living , it would have been at once announced in the Gazette , as he is a colonel . '' 
The princess looked at him , not grasping what he was saying , but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face . 
`` And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound '' -LRB- the Gazette said it was a shell -RRB- `` either proving fatal at once or being very slight , '' continued Nicholas . 
`` We must hope for the best , and I am sure ... '' Princess Mary interrupted him . 
`` Oh , that would be so dread ... '' she began and , prevented by agitation from finishing , she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and , looking up at him gratefully , went out , following her aunt . 
That evening Nicholas did not go out , but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers . 
When he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed , and for a long time he paced up and down the room , reflecting on his life , a thing he rarely did . 
Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in Smolensk province .
