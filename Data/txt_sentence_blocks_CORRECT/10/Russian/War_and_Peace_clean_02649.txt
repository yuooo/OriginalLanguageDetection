She knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved , and was happy in regard to it . 
But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force ; on the contrary , that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother . 
That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving Voronezh that those who saw her off , as they looked at her careworn , despairing face , felt sure she would fall ill on the journey . 
But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey , which she took so actively in hand , saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength . 
As always happens when traveling , Princess Mary thought only of the journey itself , forgetting its object . 
But as she approached Yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there -- not after many days , but that very evening -- again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit . 
The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl , and in what condition Prince Andrew was , when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess ' face that looked out at him from the window . 
`` I have found out everything , your excellency : the Rostovs are staying at the merchant Bronnikov 's house , in the Square not far from here , right above the Volga , '' said the courier . 
Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry , not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know : how was her brother ? 
Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her .
