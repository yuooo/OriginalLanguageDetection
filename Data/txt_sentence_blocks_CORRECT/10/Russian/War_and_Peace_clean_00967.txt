`` Nicholas , have you come ? 
Come here , dear ! '' 
called the old countess from the drawing room . 
Nicholas went to her , kissed her hand , and sitting down silently at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards . 
From the dancing room , they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Natasha to sing . 
`` All wight ! 
All wight ! '' 
shouted Denisov . 
`` It 's no good making excuses now ! 
It 's your turn to sing the ba ` cawolla -- I entweat you ! ''
