`` Well , you see , first I thought that Rugay , the red hound , was like Uncle , and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him , if not for his riding , then for his manner . 
What a good fellow Uncle is ! 
Do n't you think so ? 
... Well , and you ? '' 
`` I ? 
Wait a bit , wait ... . 
Yes , first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home , but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness , and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe , but in Fairyland . 
And then I thought ... No , nothing else . ''
