During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life , he had thought , felt , and seen so much -LRB- having traveled both in the east and the west -RRB- , that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail . 
He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted , sleeping castle . 
The same old stateliness , the same cleanliness , the same stillness reigned there , and inside there was the same furniture , the same walls , sounds , and smell , and the same timid faces , only somewhat older . 
Princess Mary was still the same timid , plain maiden getting on in years , uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish , self-satisfied girl , enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future . 
She had merely become more self-confident , Prince Andrew thought . 
Dessalles , the tutor he had brought from Switzerland , was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants , but was still the same narrowly intelligent , conscientious , and pedantic preceptor . 
The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth , which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth ; in character he was the same as ever , only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world . 
Little Nicholas alone had changed . 
He had grown , become rosier , had curly dark hair , and , when merry and laughing , quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do .
