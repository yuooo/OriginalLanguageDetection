The feeling , `` It has begun ! 
Here it is ! '' 
was seen even on Prince Bagration 's hard brown face with its half-closed , dull , sleepy eyes . 
Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what , if anything , this man was thinking and feeling at that moment . 
`` Is there anything at all behind that impassive face ? '' 
Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked . 
Prince Bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him , and said , `` Very good ! '' 
in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen . 
Prince Andrew , out of breath with his rapid ride , spoke quickly . 
Prince Bagration , uttering his words with an Oriental accent , spoke particularly slowly , as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry .
