Mitya interrupted , and went off into his abrupt , short laugh . 
`` Andrey , simple soul , '' he seized him by the shoulders again , `` tell me , will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell , or not , what do you think ? '' 
`` I do n't know , darling , it depends on you , for you are ... you see , sir , when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died , He went straight down to hell from the Cross , and set free all sinners that were in agony . 
And the devil groaned , because he thought that he would get no more sinners in hell . 
And God said to him , then , ` Do n't groan , for you shall have all the mighty of the earth , the rulers , the chief judges , and the rich men , and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I come again . ' 
Those were His very words ... '' `` A peasant legend ! 
Capital ! 
Whip up the left , Andrey ! '' 
`` So you see , sir , who it is hell 's for , '' said Andrey , whipping up the left horse , `` but you 're like a little child ... that 's how we look on you ... and though you 're hasty-tempered , sir , yet God will forgive you for your kind heart . '' 
`` And you , do you forgive me , Andrey ? ''
