The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anisya Fedorovna herself : a savor of juiciness , cleanliness , whiteness , and pleasant smiles . 
`` Take this , little Lady-Countess ! '' 
she kept saying , as she offered Natasha first one thing and then another . 
Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes , such aromatic jam , such honey-and-nut sweets , or such a chicken anywhere . 
Anisya Fedorovna left the room .
