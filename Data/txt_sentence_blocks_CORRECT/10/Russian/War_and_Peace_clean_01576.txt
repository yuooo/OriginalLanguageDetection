They did not drag her away at once , but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off , and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer . 
All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience . 
During this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls she saw Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair , staring at her . 
She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it . 
When the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose , turned to the Rostovs ' box -- her whole bosom completely exposed -- beckoned the old count with a gloved finger , and paying no attention to those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile . 
`` Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters , '' said she . 
`` The whole town is singing their praises and I do n't even know then ! '' 
Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess . 
She was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure .
