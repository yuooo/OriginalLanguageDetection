The squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck . 
The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov , the squadron commander , known throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov . 
Cadet Rostov , ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland , had lived with the squadron commander . 
On October 11 , the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack 's defeat , the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual . 
Denisov , who had been losing at cards all night , had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition . 
Rostov in his cadet uniform , with a jerk to his horse , rode up to the porch , swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement , stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse , and at last sprang down and called to his orderly . 
`` Ah , Bondarenko , dear friend ! '' 
said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse . 
`` Walk him up and down , my dear fellow , '' he continued , with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy . 
`` Yes , your excellency , '' answered the Ukrainian gaily , tossing his head .
