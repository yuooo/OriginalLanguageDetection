`` What ? 
What ? 
What ? 
... Cut them down ! 
What ? 
... '' said Rostov , waking up . 
At the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him , where the enemy was , the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices . 
His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts . 
Over there , where the shouting came from , a fire flared up and went out again , then another , and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder . 
Rostov could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them .
