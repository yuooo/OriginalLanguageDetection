Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked . 
With others Balaga bargained , charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours ' drive , and rarely drove himself , generally letting his young men do so . 
But with `` his gentlemen '' he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work . 
Only a couple of times a year -- when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand -- he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him . 
The gentlemen always made him sit down . 
`` Do help me out , Theodore Ivanych , sir , '' or `` your excellency , '' he would say . 
`` I am quite out of horses . 
Let me have what you can to go to the fair . '' 
And Anatole and Dolokhov , when they had money , would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles . 
Balaga was a fair-haired , short , and snub-nosed peasant of about twenty-seven ; red-faced , with a particularly red thick neck , glittering little eyes , and a small beard .
