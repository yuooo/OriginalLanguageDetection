So that 's where the envelope lay , in the corner behind the ikons . 
It would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress ; the box , anyway , could be locked . 
But all believe it was under the mattress . 
A stupid thing to believe . 
So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch had committed the murder , finding nothing , he would either have run away in a hurry , afraid of every sound , as always happens with murderers , or he would have been arrested . 
So I could always have clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money next moming or even that night , and it would have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
I could reckon upon that . '' 
`` But what if he did not kill him , but only knocked him down ? '' 
`` If he did not kill him , of course , I would not have ventured to take the money , and nothing would have happened . 
But I calculated that he would beat him senseless , and I should have time to take it then , and then I 'd make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money after beating him . ''
