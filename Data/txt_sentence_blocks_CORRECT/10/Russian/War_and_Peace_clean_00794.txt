`` What ? '' 
he answered , not recognizing Boris . 
`` I say , we 've been in the front line ! 
Our regiment attacked ! '' 
said Boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time . 
Rostov stopped . 
`` Have you ? '' 
he said . 
`` Well , how did it go ? ''
