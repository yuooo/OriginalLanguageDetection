Beg ! '' 
shouted Kolya , jumping up , and the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha 's bedside . 
What followed was a surprise to everyone : Ilusha started , lurched violently forward , bent over Perezvon and gazed at him , faint with suspense . 
`` It 's ... Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried suddenly , in a voice breaking with joy and suffering . 
`` And who did you think it was ? '' 
Krassotkin shouted with all his might , in a ringing , happy voice , and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to Ilusha . 
`` Look , old man , you see , blind of one eye and the left ear is torn , just the marks you described to me . 
It was by that I found him . 
I found him directly .
