`` I will the bridge fire , '' he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing . 
Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything , the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron , that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov , to return to the bridge . 
`` There , it 's just as I thought , '' said Rostov to himself . 
`` He wishes to test me ! '' 
His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face . 
`` Let him see whether I am a coward ! '' 
he thought . 
Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire . 
Rostov watched his enemy , the colonel , closely -- to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture , but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov , and looked as he always did when at the front , solemn and stern . 
Then came the word of command .
