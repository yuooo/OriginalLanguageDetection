And yet , in spite of his resolution , there was confusion in his soul , an agonising confusion : his resolution did not give him peace . 
There was so much behind that tortured him . 
And it seemed strange to him , at moments , to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper : `` I punish myself , '' and the paper was lying there in his pocket , ready ; the pistol was loaded ; he had already resolved how , next morning , he would meet the first warm ray of `` golden-haired Phoebus . '' 
And yet he could not be quit of the past , of all that he had left behind and that tortured him . 
He felt that miserably , and the thought of it sank into his heart with despair . 
There was one moment when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey , to jump out of the cart , to pull out his loaded pistol , and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn . 
But that moment flew by like a spark . 
The horses galloped on , `` devouring space , '' and as he drew near his goal , again the thought of her , of her alone , took more and more complete possession of his soul , chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it . 
Oh , how he longed to look upon her , if only for a moment , if only from a distance ! 
`` She 's now with him , '' he thought , `` now I shall see what she looks like with him , her first love , and that 's all I want . ''
