no doubt , in the monastery he fully believed in miracles , but , to my thinking , miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist . 
It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief . 
The genuine realist , if he is an unbeliever , will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous , and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact . 
Even if he admits it , he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognised by him . 
Faith does not , in the realist , spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith . 
If the realist once believes , then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also . 
The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw , but when he did see he said , `` My Lord and my God ! '' 
Was it the miracle forced him to believe ? 
Most likely not , but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said , `` I do not believe till I see . '' 
I shall be told , perhaps , that Alyosha was stupid , undeveloped , had not finished his studies , and so on .
