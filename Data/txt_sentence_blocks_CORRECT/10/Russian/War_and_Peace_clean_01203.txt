Is he to go up for examination ? '' 
`` Yes , that 's a difficulty , as education is not at all general , but ... '' Count Kochubey did not finish . 
He rose , took Prince Andrew by the arm , and went to meet a tall , bald , fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness , who was just entering . 
The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast . 
It was Speranski . 
Prince Andrew recognized him at once , and felt a throb within him , as happens at critical moments of life . 
Whether it was from respect , envy , or anticipation , he did not know . 
Speranski 's whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable . 
In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance ; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed , rather humid eyes , or so firm a smile that expressed nothing ; nor had he heard such a refined , smooth , soft voice ; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands -- hands which were broad , but very plump , soft , and white . 
Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital .
