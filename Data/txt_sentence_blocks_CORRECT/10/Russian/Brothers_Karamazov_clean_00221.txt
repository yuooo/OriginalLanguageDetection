He had a footing everywhere , and got information about everything . 
He was of an uneasy and envious temper . 
He was well aware of his own considerable abilities , and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit . 
He knew he would play a prominent part of some sort , but Alyosha , who was attached to him , was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonourable , and quite unconscious of being so himself , considering , on the contrary , that because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity . 
Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have influenced him in that . 
Rakitin , of course , was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner , to which Father Iosif , Father Paissy , and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited . 
They were already waiting when Miusov , Kalganov , and Ivan arrived . 
The other guest , Maximov , stood a little aside , waiting also . 
The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests . 
He was a tall , thin , but still vigorous old man , with black hair streaked with grey , and a long , grave , ascetic face .
