`` What a style ! 
How charmingly he describes ! '' 
said she , reading the descriptive part of the letter . 
`` And what a soul ! 
Not a word about himself ... . 
Not a word ! 
About some Denisov or other , though he himself , I dare say , is braver than any of them . 
He says nothing about his sufferings . 
What a heart ! 
How like him it is !
