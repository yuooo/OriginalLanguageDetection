`` And who will inherit his wealth ? '' 
he added in a whisper . 
`` It vo n't go begging , '' replied the German with a smile . 
Everyone again looked toward the door , which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain 's instructions . 
The German doctor went up to Lorrain . 
`` Do you think he can last till morning ? '' 
asked the German , addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly . 
Lorrain , pursing up his lips , waved a severely negative finger before his nose . 
`` Tonight , not later , '' said he in a low voice , and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient 's condition .
