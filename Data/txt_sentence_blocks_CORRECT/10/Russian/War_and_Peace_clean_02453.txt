There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it . 
All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where , they thought , yet greater riches might be found . 
And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper . 
When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results ; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city . 
The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine , * the Russians to the barbarity of the French . 
In reality , however , it was not , and could not be , possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual , or any group of people , responsible for it . 
Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn , quite apart from whether it had , or had not , a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines . 
Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days . 
A town built of wood , where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present , can not help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes , make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square , and cook themselves meals twice a day . 
In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases .
