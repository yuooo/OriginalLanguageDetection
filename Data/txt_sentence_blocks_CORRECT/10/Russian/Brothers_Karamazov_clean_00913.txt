All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day . 
`` He has disgraced the uniform , '' they said ; `` Let him resign his commission . '' 
Some stood up for me : `` He faced the shot , '' they said . 
`` Yes , but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness . '' 
`` If he had been afraid of being shot , he would have shot his own pistol first before asking forgiveness , while he flung it loaded into the forest . 
No , there 's something else in this , something original . '' 
I enjoyed listening and looking at them . 
`` My dear friends and comrades , '' said I , `` do n't worry about my resigning my commission , for I have done so already . 
I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery - it 's with that object I am leaving the regiment . '' 
When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing .
