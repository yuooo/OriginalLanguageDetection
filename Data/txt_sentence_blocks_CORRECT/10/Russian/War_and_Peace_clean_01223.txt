These words are all the more remarkable because , in spite of his great physical sufferings , Joseph Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death , for which -- in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man -- he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared . 
My benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything . 
He advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers , but to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge , to try , while diverting the Brothers from pride , to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and self-perfecting . 
Besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself , and to that end he gave me a notebook , the one I am now writing in and in which I will in future note down all my actions . 
Petersburg , 23rd November I am again living with my wife . 
My mother-in-law came to me in tears and said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her ; that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion , and much more . 
I knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted . 
In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek . 
Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do . 
I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexeevich 's letters and recalled my conversations with him , and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a suppliant , and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone -- especially to one so closely bound to me -- and that I must bear my cross .
