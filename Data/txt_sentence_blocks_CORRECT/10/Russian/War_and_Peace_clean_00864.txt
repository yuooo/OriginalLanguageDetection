Some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men . 
The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin , Valuev , and Naryshkin . 
Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets . 
Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz . 
In the third circle , Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals . 
Shinshin , standing close by , tried to make a joke , saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed to learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock , but the elder members glanced severely at the wit , making him feel that in that place and on that day , it was improper to speak so of Kutuzov . 
Count Ilya Rostov , hurried and preoccupied , went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms , hastily greeting the important and unimportant , all of whom he knew , as if they were all equals , while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son , resting on him and winking joyfully at him . 
Young Rostov stood at a window with Dolokhov , whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued . 
The old count came up to them and pressed Dolokhov 's hand . 
`` Please come and visit us ... you know my brave boy ... been together out there ... both playing the hero ... Ah , Vasili Ignatovich ... How d'ye do , old fellow ? ''
