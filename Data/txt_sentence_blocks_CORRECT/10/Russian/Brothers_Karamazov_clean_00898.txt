Only we two were not sleeping , the lad and I , and we talked of the beauty of this world of God 's and of the great mystery of it . 
Every blade of grass , every insect , ant , and golden bee , all so marvellously know their path , though they have not intelligence , they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually accomplish it themselves . 
I saw the dear lad 's heart was moved . 
He told me that he loved the forest and the forest birds . 
He was a bird-catcher , knew the note of each of them , could call each bird . 
`` I know nothing better than to be in the forest , '' said he , `` though all things are good . '' 
`` Truly , '' I answered him , `` all things are good and fair , because all is truth . 
Look , '' said I , `` at the horse , that great beast that is so near to man ; or the lowly , pensive ox , which feeds him and works for him ; look at their faces , what meekness , what devotion to man , who often beats them mercilessly . 
What gentleness , what confidence and what beauty ! 
It 's touching to know that there 's no sin in them , for all , all except man , is sinless , and Christ has been with them before us . ''
