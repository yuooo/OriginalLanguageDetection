Pierre noticed this but could not go . 
He felt uneasy and embarrassed , but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave . 
Princess Mary , foreseeing no end to this , rose first , and complaining of a headache began to say good night . 
`` So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow ? '' 
she asked . 
`` No , I am not going , '' Pierre replied hastily , in a surprised tone and as though offended . 
`` Yes ... no ... to Petersburg ? 
Tomorrow -- but I wo n't say good-by yet . 
I will call round in case you have any commissions for me , '' said he , standing before Princess Mary and turning red , but not taking his departure . 
Natasha gave him her hand and went out .
