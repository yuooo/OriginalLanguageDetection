`` Perhaps you are right for yourself , '' he added after a short pause , `` but everyone lives in his own way . 
You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others . 
I experienced just the reverse . 
I lived for glory . 
-- And after all what is glory ? 
The same love of others , a desire to do something for them , a desire for their approval . 
-- So I lived for others , and not almost , but quite , ruined my life . 
And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself . '' 
`` But what do you mean by living only for yourself ? '' 
asked Pierre , growing excited .
