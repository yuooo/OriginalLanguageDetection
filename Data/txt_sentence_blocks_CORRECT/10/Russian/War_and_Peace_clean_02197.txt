Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground . 
At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame , and immediately a deafening roar , crackling , and whistling made his ears tingle .

Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery , as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him . 
On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery .

and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the arm . 
He also saw something else that was strange . 
But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed , that the soldier shouting `` Brothers ! ''
