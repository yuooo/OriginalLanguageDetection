`` Who is that man ? '' 
said he , looking sternly at Pierre . 
`` Oh , I am really in despair at what has occurred , '' said Pierre rapidly , quite forgetting the part he had intended to play . 
`` He is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing . '' 
The officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him by the collar . 
Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips , swaying , as if about to fall asleep , as he leaned against the wall . 
`` Brigand ! 
You shall pay for this , '' said the Frenchman , letting go of him . 
`` We French are merciful after victory , but we do not pardon traitors , '' he added , with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture . 
Pierre continued , in French , to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account .
