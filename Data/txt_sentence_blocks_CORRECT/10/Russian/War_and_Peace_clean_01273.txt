`` There are some like ourselves and some worse , '' she thought . 
Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at the ball . 
`` That is the Dutch ambassador , do you see ? 
That gray-haired man , '' she said , indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair , who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said . 
`` Ah , here she is , the Queen of Petersburg , Countess Bezukhova , '' said Peronskaya , indicating Helene who had just entered . 
`` How lovely ! 
She is quite equal to Marya Antonovna . 
See how the men , young and old , pay court to her . 
Beautiful and clever ... they say Prince -- is quite mad about her . 
But see , those two , though not good-looking , are even more run after . ''
