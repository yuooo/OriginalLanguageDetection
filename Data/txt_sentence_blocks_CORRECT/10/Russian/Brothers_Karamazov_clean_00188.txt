You will wait , and be of service . 
If evil spirits rise up , repeat a prayer . 
And remember , my son '' - the elder liked to call him that - `` this is not the place for you in the future . 
When it is God 's will to call me , leave the monastery . 
Go away for good . ''

`` What is it ? 
This is not your place for the time . 
I bless you for great service in the world . 
Yours will be a long pilgrimage .
