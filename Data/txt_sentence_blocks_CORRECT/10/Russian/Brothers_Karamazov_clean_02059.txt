I love men genuinely , I 've been greatly calumniated ! 
Here when I stay with you from time to time , my life gains a kind of reality and that 's what I like most of all . 
You see , like you , I suffer from the fantastic and so I love the realism of earth . 
Here , with you , everything is circumscribed , here all is formulated and geometrical , while we have nothing but indeterminate equations ! 
I wander about here dreaming . 
I like dreaming . 
Besides , on earth I become superstitious . 
Please do n't laugh , that 's just what I like , to become superstitious . 
I adopt all your habits here : I 've grown fond of going to the public baths , would you believe it ? 
and I go and steam myself with merchants and priests .
