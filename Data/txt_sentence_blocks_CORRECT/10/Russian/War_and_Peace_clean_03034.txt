But the once proud and shrewd rulers of France , feeling that their part is played out , are even more bewildered than he , and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power . 
Chance , millions of chances , give him power , and all men as if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power . 
Chance forms the characters of the rulers of France , who submit to him ; chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government ; chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power . 
Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him -- thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right , since he had the might . 
Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against England -LRB- which would inevitably have ruined him -RRB- he never carries out that intention , but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians , who surrender without a battle . 
Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz ; and by chance all men , not only the French but all Europe -- except England which does not take part in the events about to happen -- despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes , now recognize his authority , the title he has given himself , and his ideal of grandeur and glory , which seems excellent and reasonable to them all . 
As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement , the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805 , 1806 , 1807 , and 1809 , gaining strength and growing . 
In 1811 the group of people that had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central Europe . 
The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group . 
During the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe .
