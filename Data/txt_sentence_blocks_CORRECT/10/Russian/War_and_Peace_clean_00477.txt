he continued dictating to the clerk . 
`` The Kiev Grenadiers , Podolian ... '' `` One ca n't write so fast , your honor , '' said the clerk , glancing angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlovski . 
Through the door came the sounds of Kutuzov 's voice , excited and dissatisfied , interrupted by another , an unfamiliar voice . 
From the sound of these voices , the inattentive way Kozlovski looked at him , the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk , the fact that the clerk and Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief , and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window , Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen . 
He turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions . 
`` Immediately , Prince , '' said Kozlovski . 
`` Dispositions for Bagration . '' 
`` What about capitulation ? '' 
`` Nothing of the sort . 
Orders are issued for a battle . ''
