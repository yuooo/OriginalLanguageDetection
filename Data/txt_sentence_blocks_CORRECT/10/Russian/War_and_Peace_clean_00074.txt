It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night . 
On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening , after which there was generally a drinking bout , finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of . 
`` I should like to go to Kuragin 's , '' thought he . 
But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there . 
Then , as happens to people of weak character , he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go . 
The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account , because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering ; `` besides , '' thought he , `` all such ` words of honor ' are conventional things with no definite meaning , especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead , or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same ! '' 
Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort , nullifying all his decisions and intentions . 
He went to Kuragin 's . 
Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards ' barracks , in which Anatole lived , Pierre entered the lighted porch , ascended the stairs , and went in at the open door . 
There was no one in the anteroom ; empty bottles , cloaks , and overshoes were lying about ; there was a smell of alcohol , and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance .
