The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room . 
Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say . 
`` Tell me , when did the battle begin ? '' 
he asked hurriedly . 
Prince Andrew replied . 
Then followed other questions just as simple : `` Was Kutuzov well ? 
When had he left Krems ? '' 
and so on . 
The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions - the answers to these questions , as was only too evident , did not interest him . 
`` At what o'clock did the battle begin ? ''
