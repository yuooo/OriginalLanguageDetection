`` Defend you ! 
Is it for me to defend you ? 
Should I dare to defend you ? 
Grushenka , angel , give me your hand . 
Look at that charming soft little hand , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
Look at it ! 
It has brought me happiness and has lifted me up , and I 'm going to kiss it , outside and inside , here , here , here ! '' 
And three times she kissed the certainly charming , though rather fat , hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture . 
She held out her hand with a charming musical , nervous little laugh , watched the `` sweet young lady , '' and obviously liked having her hand kissed . 
`` Perhaps there 's rather too much rapture , '' thought Alyosha .
