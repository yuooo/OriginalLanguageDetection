`` God , can that too be false ? '' 
I thought as I wept . 
`` In truth , perhaps , I am more than all others responsible for all , a greater sinner than all men in the world . '' 
And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared to me : what was I going to do ? 
I was going to kill a good , clever , noble man , who had done me no wrong , and by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life , I should be torturing and killing her too . 
I lay thus in my bed with my face in the pillow , heedless how the time was passing . 
Suddenly my second , the ensign , came in with the pistols to fetch me . 
`` Ah , '' said he , `` it 's a good thing you are up already , it 's time we were off , come along ! '' 
I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided ; we went out to the carriage , however . 
`` Wait here a minute , '' I said to him .
