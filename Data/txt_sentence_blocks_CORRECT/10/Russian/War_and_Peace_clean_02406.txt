Another smith tried to enter the doorway , pressing against the publican with his chest . 
The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly : `` They 're fighting us , lads ! '' 
At that moment the first smith got up and , scratching his bruised face to make it bleed , shouted in a tearful voice : `` Police ! 
Murder ! 
... They 've killed a man , lads ! '' 
`` Oh , gracious me , a man beaten to death -- killed ! 
... '' screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by . 
A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith . 
`` Have n't you robbed people enough -- taking their last shirts ? '' 
said a voice addressing the publican .
