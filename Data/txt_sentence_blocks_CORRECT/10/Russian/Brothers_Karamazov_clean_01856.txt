`` He does n't despise anyone , '' Alyosha went on . 
`` Only he does not believe anyone . 
If he does n't believe in people , of course , he does despise them . '' 
`` Then he despises me , me ? '' 
`` You , too . '' 
`` Good . '' 
Lise seemed to grind her teeth . 
`` When he went out laughing , I felt that it was nice to be despised . 
The child with fingers cut off is nice , and to be despised is nice ... '' And she laughed in Alyosha 's face , a feverish malicious laugh .
