You see , it was all to do with the old man , my dead father . 
He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous ; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him . 
So I kept thinking everyday , suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden , suppose she were to leave off tormenting me , and were suddenly to say to me , ' I love you , not him ; take me to the other end of the world . ' 
And I 'd only forty copecks ; how could I take her away , what could I do ? 
Why , I 'd be lost . 
You see , I did n't know her then , I did n't understand her , I thought she wanted money , and that she would n't forgive my poverty . 
And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand , sewed it up , calculating on it , sewed it up before I was drunk , and after I had sewn it up , I went off to get drunk on the rest . 
Yes , that was base . 
Do you understand now ? '' 
Both the lawyers laughed aloud .
