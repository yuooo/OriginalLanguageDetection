To these questions three answers are possible : Either to assume -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen , and that therefore every emergence of a new power , every struggle against the power once appointed , should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally , under definite and known conditions , and to show that all limitations , conflicts , and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally , but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite , and that the appearance of several authorities , their struggles and their falls , result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others . 
And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers . 
Some historians -- those biographical and specialist historians already referred to -- in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power , seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons , and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power , and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power -- mere violence . 
Their theory , suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history , has the inconvenience -- in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another -- that a Legitimist historian will prove that the National Convention , the Directory , and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power , while a Republican and a Bonapartist will prove : the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the real power , and that all the others were violations of power . 
Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children . 
Recognizing the falsity of this view of history , another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers , and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them . 
But what this program consists in these historians do not say , or if they do they continually contradict one another . 
Each historian , according to his view of what constitutes a nation 's progress , looks for these conditions in the greatness , wealth , freedom , or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country . 
But not to mention the historians ' contradictions as to the nature of this program -- or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists -- the facts of history almost always contradict that theory . 
If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth , freedom , and enlightenment of the people , how is it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly , while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people ?
