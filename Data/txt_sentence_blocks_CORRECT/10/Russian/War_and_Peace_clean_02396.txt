This man , bent double , rushed past the tradesman and the officer . 
The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops , but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square . 
`` What is it ? 
What is it ? '' 
he asked , but his comrade was already galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which the screams came . 
The officer mounted his horse and rode after him . 
When he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns , the infantry crossing the bridge , several overturned carts , and frightened and laughing faces among the troops . 
Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed . 
Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels . 
The cart was loaded high , and at the very top , beside a child 's chair with its legs in the air , sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks .
