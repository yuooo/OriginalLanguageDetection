In the rich , isolation and spiritual suicide ; in the poor , envy and murder ; for they have been given rights , but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants . 
They maintain that the world is getting more and more united , more and more bound together in brotherly community , as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air . 
Alas , put no faith in such a bond of union . 
Interpreting freedom as the multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires , men distort their own nature , for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous fancies are fostered in them . 
They live only for mutual envy , for luxury and ostentation . 
To have dinners visits , carriages , rank , and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as a necessity , for which life , honour and human feeling are sacrificed , and men even commit suicide if they are unable to satisfy it . 
We see the same thing among those who are not rich , while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness . 
But soon they will drink blood instead of wine , they are being led on to it . 
I ask you is such a man free ? 
I knew one `` champion of freedom '' who told me himself that , when he was deprived of tobacco in prison , he was so wretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting tobacco again !
