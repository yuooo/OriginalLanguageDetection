Certainly ! '' 
said Tushin . 
`` But still , to conceive a future life ... '' He did not finish . 
Just then there was a whistle in the air ; nearer and nearer , faster and louder , louder and faster , a cannon ball , as if it had not finished saying what was necessary , thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force , throwing up a mass of earth . 
The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact . 
And immediately Tushin , with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind , intelligent face rather pale , rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice , a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company , buttoning up his coat as he ran . 
Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery , looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball . 
His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space , but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left . 
The smoke above it had not yet dispersed . 
Two mounted Frenchmen , probably adjutants , were galloping up the hill .
