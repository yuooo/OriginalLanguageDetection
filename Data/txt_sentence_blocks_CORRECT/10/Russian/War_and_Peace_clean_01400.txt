But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karay -- the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf , and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them . 
That instant , when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs , while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head , with her ears laid back -LRB- Karay was pinning her by the throat -RRB- , was the happiest moment of his life . 
With his hand on his saddlebow , he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf , when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs , and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully . 
She clicked her teeth -LRB- Karay no longer had her by the throat -RRB- , leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully , and having disengaged herself from the dogs , with tail tucked in again , went forward . 
Karay , his hair bristling , and probably bruised or wounded , climbed with difficulty out of the gully . 
`` Oh my God ! 
Why ? '' 
Nicholas cried in despair . 
`` Uncle 's '' huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf 's path and his borzois once more stopped the animal 's advance . 
She was again hemmed in .
