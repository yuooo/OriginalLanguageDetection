Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in again . 
I was surprised . 
Where have you been ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` I think , '' he said , `` I 've forgotten something ... my handkerchief , I think ... . 
Well , even if I 've not forgotten anything , let me stay a little . '' 
He sat down . 
I stood over him . 
`` You sit down , too , '' said he . 
I sat down .
