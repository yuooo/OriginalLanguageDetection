The whole day had been hot . 
Somewhere a storm was gathering , but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly , sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves . 
The left side of the forest was dark in the shade , the right side glittered in the sunlight , wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze . 
Everything was in blossom , the nightingales trilled , and their voices reverberated now near , now far away . 
`` Yes , here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed , '' thought Prince Andrew . 
`` But where is it ? '' 
he again wondered , gazing at the left side of the road , and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought . 
The old oak , quite transfigured , spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage , stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun . 
Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now . 
Through the hard century-old bark , even where there were no twigs , leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced .
