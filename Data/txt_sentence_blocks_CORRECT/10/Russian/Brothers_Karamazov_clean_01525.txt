He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it !
