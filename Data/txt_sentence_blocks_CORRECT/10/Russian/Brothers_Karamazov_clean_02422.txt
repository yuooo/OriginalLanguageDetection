Ilusha 's little bed is still there - '' `` Yes , yes , mamma ! '' 
Snegiryov suddenly recollected , `` they 'll take away the bed , they 'll take it away , '' he added as though alarmed that they really would . 
He jumped up and ran homewards again . 
But it was not far off and they all arrived together . 
Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarrelled just before : `` Mamma , poor crippled darling , Ilusha has sent you these flowers , '' he cried , holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow . 
But at that instant he saw in the corner , by the little bed , Ilusha 's little boots , which the landlady had put tidily side by side . 
Seeing the old , patched , rusty-looking , stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them , fell on his knees , snatched up one boot and , pressing his lips to it , began kissing it greedily , crying , `` Ilusha , old man , dear old man , where are your little feet ? '' 
`` Where have you taken him away ? 
Where have you taken him ? '' 
the lunatic cried in a heart-rending voice .
