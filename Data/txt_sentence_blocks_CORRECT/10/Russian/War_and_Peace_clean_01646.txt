Anatole went into the back room . 
`` Now then ! 
Nearly ready ? 
You 're dawdling ! '' 
he shouted to the servants . 
Dolokhov put away the money , called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey , and went into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting . 
Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively , while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself . 
`` Come and eat something . 
Have a drink ! '' 
Dolokhov shouted to him from the other room .
