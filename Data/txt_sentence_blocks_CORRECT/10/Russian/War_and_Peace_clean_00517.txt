and he drew attention to the bullets whistling , singing , and hissing continually around them . 
He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax : `` We are used to it , but you , sir , will blister your hands . '' 
He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him , and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words . 
The staff officer joined in the colonel 's appeals , but Bagration did not reply ; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form , so as to give room for the two approaching battalions . 
While he was speaking , the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow , driven by a rising wind , began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand , and the hill opposite , with the French moving about on it , opened out before them . 
All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground . 
One could already see the soldiers ' shaggy caps , distinguish the officers from the men , and see the standard flapping against its staff . 
`` They march splendidly , '' remarked someone in Bagration 's suite . 
The head of the column had already descended into the hollow . 
The clash would take place on this side of it ... The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right ; from behind it , dispersing the laggards , came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order .
