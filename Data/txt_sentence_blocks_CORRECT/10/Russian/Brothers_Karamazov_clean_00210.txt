Ah , Ivan has set you a problem ! '' 
cried Rakitin , with undisguised malice . 
His face changed , and his lips twitched . 
`` And the problem 's a stupid one . 
It is no good guessing it . 
Rack your brains - you 'll understand it . 
His article is absurd and ridiculous . 
And did you hear his stupid theory just now : if there 's no immortality of the soul , then there 's no virtue , and everything is lawful . 
-LRB- And by the way , do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out : ' I will remember ! ' -RRB- 
An attractive theory for scoundrels !
