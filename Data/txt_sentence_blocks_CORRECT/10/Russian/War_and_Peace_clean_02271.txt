In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire . 
In Vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince . 
When she returned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there , and both claimed their rights . 
Helene was faced by a new problem -- how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either . 
What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova , who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman .

I expected nothing else . 
A woman sacrifices herself for you , she suffers , and this is her reward !
