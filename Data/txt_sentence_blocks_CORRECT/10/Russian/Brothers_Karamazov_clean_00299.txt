She gave her services freely without asking for payment , but if anyone offered her payment , she did n't refuse . 
The colonel , of course , was a very different matter . 
He was one of the chief personages in the district . 
He kept open house , entertained the whole town , gave suppers and dances . 
At the time I arrived and joined the battalion , all the town was talking of the expected return of the colonel 's second daughter , a great beauty , who had just left a fashionable school in the capital . 
This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna , and she was the child of the second wife , who belonged to a distinguished general 's family ; although , as I learnt on good authority , she too brought the colonel no money . 
She had connections , and that was all . 
There may have been expectations , but they had come to nothing . 
`` Yet , when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit , the whole town revived . 
Our most distinguished ladies - two ` Excellencies ' and a colonel 's wife - and all the rest following their lead , at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honour .
