I shall be asked : Then why did he talk about it in taverns ? 
A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself . 
Yes , but he talked about it before he had formed a plan , when he had only the desire , only the impulse to it . 
Afterwards he talked less about it . 
On the evening he wrote that letter at the Metropolis tavern , contrary to his custom he was silent , though he had been drinking . 
He did not play billiards , he sat in a corner , talked to no one . 
He did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat , but that was done almost unconsciously , because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance . 
It is true that after he had taken the final decision , he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand , and that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards . 
But there was nothing for it ; he could not take his words back , but his luck had served him before , it would serve him again . 
He believed in his star , you know !
