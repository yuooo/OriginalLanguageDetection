I was struck dumb at these amazing words , and answered , ` On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent young man , a young man of such learning too , and so unfortunate ? ' 
- for all this business is a misfortune , is n't it ? ' 
She suddenly burst out laughing at my words , and so rudely , you know . 
Well , I was pleased ; I thought I had amused her and the fits would pass off , especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without my knowledge , and meant to ask him for an explanation . 
But early this morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and , would you believe it , slapped her in the face . 
That 's monstrous ; I am always polite to my servants . 
And an hour later she was hugging Yulia 's feet and kissing them . 
She sent a message to me that she was n't coming to me at all , and would never come and see me again , and when I dragged myself down to her , she rushed to kiss me , crying , and as she kissed me , she pushed me out of the room without saying a word , so I could n't find out what was the matter . 
Now , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , I rest all my hopes on you , and , of course , my whole life is in your hands . 
I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything from her , as you alone can , and come back and tell me - me , her mother , for you understand it will be the death of me , simply the death of me , if this goes on , or else I shall run away .
