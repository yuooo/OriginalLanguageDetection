The Emperor looked smilingly down the room . 
A minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing . 
An aide-de-camp , the Master of Ceremonies , went up to Countess Bezukhova and asked her to dance . 
She smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him . 
The aide-de-camp , an adept in his art , grasping his partner firmly round her waist , with confident deliberation started smoothly , gliding first round the edge of the circle , then at the corner of the room he caught Helene 's left hand and turned her , the only sound audible , apart from the ever-quickening music , being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid , agile feet , while at every third beat his partner 's velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round . 
Natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz . 
Prince Andrew , in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel , wearing stockings and dancing shoes , stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs . 
Baron Firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be held next day . 
Prince Andrew , as one closely connected with Speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission , could give reliable information about that sitting , concerning which various rumors were current . 
But not listening to what Firhoff was saying , he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle .
