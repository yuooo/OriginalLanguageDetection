Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the court just now , and we were told that they were the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us , and that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before . 
But I need not recall the painful scene , though I will make one or two comments , selecting such trivial ones as might not be obvious at first sight to everyone , and so may be overlooked . 
In the first place , Smerdyakov must have given back the money and hanged himself yesterday from remorse . 
And only yesterday he confessed his guilt to Ivan Karamazov , as the latter informs us . 
If it were not so , indeed , why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now ? 
And so , if he has confessed , then why , I ask again , did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left behind , knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day ? 
`` The money alone is no proof . 
A week ago , quite by chance , the fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent coupons of five thousand each - that is , ten thousand in all - to the chief town of the province to be changed . 
I only mention this to point out that anyone may have money , and that it ca n't be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's envelope . 
`` Ivan Karamazov , after receiving yesterday a communication of such importance from the real murderer , did not stir .
