Nesvitski looked round and saw , some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry , Vaska Denisov , red and shaggy , with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder . 
`` Tell these devils , these fiends , to let me pass ! '' 
shouted Denisov evidently in a fit of rage , his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face . 
`` Ah , Vaska ! '' 
joyfully replied Nesvitski . 
`` What 's up with you ? '' 
`` The squadwon ca n't pass , '' shouted Vaska Denisov , showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab , which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it , and snorted , spurting white foam from his bit , tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs , and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him . 
`` What is this ? 
They 're like sheep ! 
Just like sheep !
