`` Yes , she has . 
It 's no matter to you . 
Let me alone . '' 
`` No , I wo n't let you alone . 
Tell me , when was she here ? '' 
`` Why , I 'd quite forgotten about her , '' said Smerdyakov , with a scornful smile , and turning his face to Ivan again , he stared at him with a look of frenzied hatred , the same look that he had fixed on him at their last interview , a month before . 
`` You seem very ill yourself , your face is sunken ; you do n't look like yourself , '' he said to Ivan . 
`` Never mind my health , tell me what I ask you. , `` But why are your eyes so yellow ? 
The whites are quite yellow .
