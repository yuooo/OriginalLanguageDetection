Do me a great service , my dear boy . 
Go to Tchermashnya on the way . 
It 's only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya , only another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya . '' 
`` I 'm sorry , I ca n't . 
It 's eighty versts to the railway and the train starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night . 
I can only just catch it . '' 
`` You 'll catch it to-morrow or the day after , but to-day turn off to Tchermashnya . 
It wo n't put you out much to humour your father ! 
If I had n't had something to keep me here , I would have run over myself long ago , for I 've some business there in a hurry .
