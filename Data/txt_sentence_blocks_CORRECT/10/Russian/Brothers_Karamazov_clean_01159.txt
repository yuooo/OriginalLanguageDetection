I 'll come and see you again about it ... many times , indeed ... but now , that three thousand you so generously ... oh , that would set me free , and if you could to-day ... you see , I have n't a minute , a minute to lose to-day - '' `` Enough , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , enough ! '' 
Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically . 
`` The question is , will you go to the gold mines or not ; have you quite made up your mind ? 
Answer yes or no . '' 
`` I will go , madam , afterwards ... . 
I 'll go where you like ... but now - '' `` Wait ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
And jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers , she began pulling out one drawer after another , looking for something with desperate haste . 
`` The three thousand , '' thought Mitya , his heart almost stopping , `` and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that 's doing things in gentlemanly style ! 
She 's a splendid woman , if only she did n't talk so much ! ''
