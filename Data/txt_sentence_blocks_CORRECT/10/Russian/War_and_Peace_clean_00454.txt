The Empress ' chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty . 
The archduchess also wished to see him . 
He did not know whom to answer , and for a few seconds collected his thoughts . 
Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder , led him to the window , and began to talk to him . 
Contrary to Bilibin 's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received . 
A thanksgiving service was arranged , Kutuzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa , and the whole army received rewards . 
Bolkonski was invited everywhere , and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries . 
Between four and five in the afternoon , having made all his calls , he was returning to Bilibin 's house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brunn . 
At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage . 
Franz , Bilibin 's man , was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door .
