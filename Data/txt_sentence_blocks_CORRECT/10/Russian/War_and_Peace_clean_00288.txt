Do you promise ? '' 
`` If it does not weigh a hundredweight and wo n't break my neck ... To please you ... '' said Prince Andrew . 
But immediately , noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister 's face , he repented and added : `` I am glad ; really , dear , I am very glad . '' 
`` Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself , for in Him alone is truth and peace , '' said she in a voice trembling with emotion , solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small , oval , antique , dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting , on a finely wrought silver chain . 
She crossed herself , kissed the icon , and handed it to Andrew . 
`` Please , Andrew , for my sake ! 
... '' Rays of gentle light shone from her large , timid eyes . 
Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin , sickly face and made it beautiful . 
Her brother would have taken the icon , but she stopped him . 
Andrew understood , crossed himself and kissed the icon .
