Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief . 
Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep , nor did they ever talk to one another about him . 
They felt that they could not express in words what they understood . 
They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly , deeper and deeper , away from them , and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right . 
He confessed , and received communion : everyone came to take leave of him . 
When they brought his son to him , he pressed his lips to the boy 's and turned away , not because he felt it hard and sad -LRB- Princess Mary and Natasha understood that -RRB- but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him , but when they told him to bless the boy , he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do . 
When the last convulsions of the body , which the spirit was leaving , occurred , Princess Mary and Natasha were present . 
`` Is it over ? '' 
said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless , growing cold before them . 
Natasha went up , looked at the dead eyes , and hastened to close them .
