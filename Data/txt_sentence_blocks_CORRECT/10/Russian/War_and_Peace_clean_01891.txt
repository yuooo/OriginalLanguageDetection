`` You know -- under the paperweight on the little table . '' 
Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly . 
`` No , do n't ! '' 
he exclaimed with a frown . 
`` You go , Michael Ivanovich . '' 
Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study . 
But as soon as he had left the room the old prince , looking uneasily round , threw down his napkin and went himself . 
`` They ca n't do anything ... always make some muddle , '' he muttered .
