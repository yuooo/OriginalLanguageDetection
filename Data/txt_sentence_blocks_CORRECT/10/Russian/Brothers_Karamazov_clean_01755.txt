`` Do you know , Karamazov , our talk has been like a declaration of love , '' said Kolya , in a bashful and melting voice . 
`` That 's not ridiculous , is it ? '' 
`` Not at all ridiculous , and if it were , it would n't matter , because it 's been a good thing . '' 
Alyosha smiled brightly . 
`` But do you know , Karamazov , you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself , now ... . 
I see it by your eyes . '' 
Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness . 
`` Why ashamed ? '' 
`` Well , why are you blushing ? '' 
`` It was you made me blush , '' laughed Alyosha , and he really did blush .
