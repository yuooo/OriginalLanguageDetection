But he 's gone , Father , he 's gone , and I shall never hear him again . 
Here 's his little sash , but him I shall never see or hear now . '' 
She drew out of her bosom her boy 's little embroidered sash , and as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs , hiding her eyes with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream . 
`` It is Rachel of old , '' said the elder , `` weeping for her children , and will not be comforted because they are not . 
Such is the lot set on earth for you mothers . 
Be not comforted . 
Consolation is not what you need . 
Weep and be not consoled , but weep . 
Only every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God , that he looks down from there at you and sees you , and rejoices at your tears , and points at them to the Lord God ; and a long while yet will you keep that great mother 's grief . 
But it will turn in the end into quiet joy , and your bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it from sin .
