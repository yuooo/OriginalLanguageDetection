Alpatych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him , one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat , and handed him two letters . 
`` To his Honor Baron Asch , from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski , '' he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters . 
A few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly said to him : `` Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing : I acted on the highest instructions -- here ... '' and he handed a paper to Alpatych . 
`` Still , as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow . 
I am just starting myself . 
Inform them ... '' But the Governor did not finish : a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in French . 
The Governor 's face expressed terror . 
`` Go , '' he said , nodding his head to Alpatych , and began questioning the officer . 
Eager , frightened , helpless glances were turned on Alpatych when he came out of the Governor 's room . 
Involuntarily listening now to the firing , which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength , Alpatych hurried to his inn .
