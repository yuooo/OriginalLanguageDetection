The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and thither , sat , stood , met , and separated , some in uniform and some in evening dress , and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans . 
Powdered footmen , in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings , stood at every door anxiously noting visitors ' every movement in order to offer their services . 
Most of those present were elderly , respected men with broad , self-confident faces , fat fingers , and resolute gestures and voices . 
This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups . 
A minority of those present were casual guests -- chiefly young men , among whom were Denisov , Rostov , and Dolokhov -- who was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment . 
The faces of these young people , especially those who were militarymen , bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation , `` We are prepared to respect and honor you , but all the same remember that the future belongs to us . '' 
Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club . 
Pierre , who at his wife 's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles , went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull . 
Here , as elsewhere , he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth , and being in the habit of lording it over these people , he treated them with absent-minded contempt . 
By his age he should have belonged to the younger men , but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored guests , and so he went from one group to another .
