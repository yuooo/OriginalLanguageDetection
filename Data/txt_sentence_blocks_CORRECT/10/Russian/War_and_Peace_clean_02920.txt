At another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the shoulder , saying something to him in a friendly manner , and Kutuzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head . 
`` What were you saying ? '' 
he asked the general , who continuing his report directed the commander in chief 's attention to some standards captured from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment . 
`` Ah , the standards ! ''

Thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him . 
He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment , sighed deeply , and closed his eyes . 
One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them .
