`` Aie ! 
Aie ! '' 
shrieked the old woman , but Mitya had vanished . 
He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived . 
At the moment he reached it , Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe . 
It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure . 
Fenya was sitting with her grandmother , the old cook , Matryona , in the kitchen when `` the captain '' ran in . 
Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him . 
`` You scream ? '' 
roared Mitya , `` where is she ? ''
