`` Why , so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy , '' said Prince Andrew with venomous irony . 
`` It is very sound : one ca n't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding . 
At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us , as they had larger forces . 
But he could not understand this , '' cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily : `` he could not understand that there , for the first time , we were fighting for Russian soil , and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before , that we had held the French for two days , and that that success had increased our strength tenfold . 
He ordered us to retreat , and all our efforts and losses went for nothing . 
He had no thought of betraying us , he tried to do the best he could , he thought out everything , and that is why he is unsuitable . 
He is unsuitable now , just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to . 
How can I explain ? 
... Well , say your father has a German valet , and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father 's requirements better than you could , then it 's all right to let him serve . 
But if your father is mortally sick you 'll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed , awkward hands , and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could .
