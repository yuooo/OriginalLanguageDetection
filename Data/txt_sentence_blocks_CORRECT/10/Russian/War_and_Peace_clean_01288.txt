`` How can people be dissatisfied with anything ? '' 
thought Natasha . 
`` Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov ! '' 
In Natasha 's eyes all the people at the ball alike were good , kind , and splendid people , loving one another ; none of them capable of injuring another -- and so they ought all to be happy . 
Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball , but his mind did not dwell on it long . 
`` Yes , it was a very brilliant ball , '' and then ... `` Yes , that little Rostova is very charming . 
There 's something fresh , original , un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her . '' 
That was all he thought about yesterday 's ball , and after his morning tea he set to work . 
But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work and could get nothing done . 
He kept criticizing his own work , as he often did , and was glad when he heard someone coming .
