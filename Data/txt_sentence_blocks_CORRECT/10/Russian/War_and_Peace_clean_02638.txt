The great thing is to live in harmony ... '' `` But it 's all the same now , '' Pierre could not help saying . 
`` Ah , my dear fellow ! '' 
rejoined Karataev , `` never decline a prison or a beggar 's sack ! '' 
He seated himself more comfortably and coughed , evidently preparing to tell a long story . 
`` Well , my dear fellow , I was still living at home , '' he began . 
`` We had a well-to-do homestead , plenty of land , we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for . 
When Father and we went out mowing there were seven of us . 
We lived well . 
We were real peasants . 
It so happened ... '' And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone 's copse to take wood , how he had been caught by the keeper , had been tried , flogged , and sent to serve as a soldier .
