`` Yes , really I did , '' Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace . 
Both the countess and Sonya understood that , naturally , neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to Natasha . 
The count returned and lay down behind the partition . 
The countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when Natasha was ill , then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish , and finally kissed her . 
`` You are cold . 
You are trembling all over . 
You 'd better lie down , '' said the countess . 
`` Lie down ? 
All right , I will . 
I 'll lie down at once , '' said Natasha .
