was heard on all sides . 
For a moment the crowd stood still , but then it made another rush forward . 
Quite beside himself , Petya , clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously , pushed forward , elbowing his way and shouting `` hurrah ! '' 
as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else , but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted `` hurrah ! '' 
`` So this is what the Emperor is ! '' 
thought Petya . 
`` No , I ca n't petition him myself -- that would be too bold . '' 
But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward , and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it ; but just then the crowd swayed back -- the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession : the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption -- and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness . 
When he came to himself , a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock -- probably a church clerk and chanter -- was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other . 
`` You 've crushed the young gentleman ! ''
