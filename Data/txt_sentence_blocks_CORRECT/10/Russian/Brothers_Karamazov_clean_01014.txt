Oh , it was not that something of the fundamental , elemental , so to speak , faith of his soul had been shaken . 
He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly , though he was suddenly murmuring against Him . 
Yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before , suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his consciousness . 
It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin , crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery , suddenly noticed Alyosha , lying face downwards on the ground under a tree , not moving and apparently asleep . 
He went up and called him by his name . 
`` You here , Alexey ? 
Can you have - '' he began wondering but broke off . 
He had meant to say , `` Can you have come to this ? '' 
Alyosha did not look at him , but from a slight movement Rakitin at once saw that he heard and understood him . 
`` What 's the matter ? ''
