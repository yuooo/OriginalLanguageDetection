`` The vicomte knew the duc personally , '' whispered Anna Pavlovna to of the guests . 
`` The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur , '' said she to another . 
`` How evidently he belongs to the best society , '' said she to a third ; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style , like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish . 
The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile . 
`` Come over here , Helene , dear , '' said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off , the center of another group . 
The princess smiled . 
She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room -- the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman . 
With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy , with a gleam of white shoulders , glossy hair , and sparkling diamonds , she passed between the men who made way for her , not looking at any of them but smiling on all , as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders , back , and bosom -- which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed -- and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna . 
Helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry , but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty . 
She seemed to wish , but to be unable , to diminish its effect .
