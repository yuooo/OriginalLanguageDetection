Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome , plump , white face . 
It was one of the marshals . 
His eye fell on Pierre 's large and striking figure , and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy . 
The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face , whipping up his skinny horse . 
Several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them . 
Their faces all looked excited and worried . 
`` What did he say ? 
What did he say ? '' 
Pierre heard them ask . 
While the marshal was passing , the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd , and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning .
