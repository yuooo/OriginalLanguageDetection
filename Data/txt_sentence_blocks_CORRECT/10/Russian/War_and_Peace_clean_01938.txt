He could not resist looking at them once more . 
Believing their danger past , they sprang from their ambush and , chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts , their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass . 
Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving . 
But not far from Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond . 
It was past one o'clock . 
The sun , a red ball through the dust , burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat . 
The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops . 
There was no wind . 
As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond . 
He longed to get into that water , however dirty it might be , and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter .
