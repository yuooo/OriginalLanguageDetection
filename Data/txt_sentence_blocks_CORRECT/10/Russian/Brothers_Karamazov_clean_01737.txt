`` Voltaire believed in God , though not very much , I think , and I do n't think he loved mankind very much either , '' said Alyosha quietly , gently , and quite naturally , as though he were talking to someone of his own age , or even older . 
Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha 's apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire . 
He seemed to be leaving the question for him , little Kolya , to settle . 
`` Have you read Voltaire ? '' 
Alyosha finished . 
`` No , not to say read ... . 
But I 've read Candide in the Russian translation ... in an absurd , grotesque , old translation . . 
-LRB- At it again ! 
again ! -RRB- '' 
`` And did you understand it ? ''
