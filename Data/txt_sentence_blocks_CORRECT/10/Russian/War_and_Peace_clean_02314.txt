The countess did not sleep at night , or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead . 
After many consultations and conversations , the count at last devised means to tranquillize her . 
He got Petya transferred from Obolenski 's regiment to Bezukhov 's , which was in training near Moscow . 
Though Petya would remain in the service , this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing , and she hoped to arrange matters for her Petya so as not to let him go again , but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle . 
As long as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it ; but when her youngest : the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons , was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody , that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show - when he was thrown amid those big , dreadful , cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it -- then his mother thought she loved him more , much more , than all her other children . 
The nearer the time came for Petya to return , the more uneasy grew the countess . 
She began to think she would never live to see such happiness . 
The presence of Sonya , of her beloved Natasha , or even of her husband irritated her . 
`` What do I want with them ? 
I want no one but Petya , '' she thought .
