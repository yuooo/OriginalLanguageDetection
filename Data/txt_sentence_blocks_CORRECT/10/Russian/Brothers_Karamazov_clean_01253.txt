Never had this woman , who was such a fateful influence in his life , aroused such love in his breast , such new and unknown feeling , surprising even to himself , a feeling tender to devoutness , to self-effacement before her ! 
`` I will efface myself ! '' 
he said , in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy . 
They had been galloping nearly an hour . 
Mitya was silent , and though Andrey was , as a rule , a talkative peasant , he did not utter a word , either . 
He seemed afraid to talk , he only whipped up smartly his three lean , but mettlesome , bay horses . 
Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible anxiety : `` Andrey ! 
What if they 're asleep ? '' 
This thought fell upon him like a blow . 
It had not occurred to him before .
