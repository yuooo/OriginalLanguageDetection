`` Now then , niece ! '' 
he exclaimed , waving to Natasha the hand that had just struck a chord . 
Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders , ran forward to face `` Uncle , '' and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude . 
Where , how , and when had this young countess , educated by an emigree French governess , imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale * would , one would have supposed , long ago have effaced ? 
But the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that `` Uncle '' had expected of her . 
As soon as she had struck her pose , and smiled triumphantly , proudly , and with sly merriment , the fear that had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end , and they were already admiring her . 
* The French shawl dance . 
She did the right thing with such precision , such complete precision , that Anisya Fedorovna , who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance , had tears in her eyes , though she laughed as she watched this slim , graceful countess , reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself , who yet was able to understand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya 's father and mother and aunt , and in every Russian man and woman . 
`` Well , little countess ; that 's it -- come on ! '' 
cried `` Uncle , '' with a joyous laugh , having finished the dance .
