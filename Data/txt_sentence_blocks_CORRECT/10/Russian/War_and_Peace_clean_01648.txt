More than once they had beaten him , and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira , which he loved ; and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia . 
They often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies ' , and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands . 
In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year , and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy . 
But he liked them ; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour , liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian , and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets . 
He liked to hear those wild , tipsy shouts behind him : `` Get on ! 
Get on ! '' 
when it was impossible to go any faster . 
He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who , more dead than alive , was already hurrying out of his way . 
`` Real gentlemen ! '' 
he considered them .
