A man in a general 's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said something in French . 
It was Count Rostopchin . 
He told Kutuzov that he had come because Moscow , the capital , was no more and only the army remained . 
`` Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle ; all this would not have happened , '' he said . 
Kutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if , not grasping what was said to him , he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him . 
Rostopchin grew confused and became silent . 
Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from Rostopchin 's face muttered softly : `` No ! 
I shall not give up Moscow without a battle ! '' 
Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words , or uttered them purposely , knowing them to be meaningless , at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him . 
And strange to say , the Governor of Moscow , the proud Count Rostopchin , took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way .
