The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged Pierre to continue . 
`` Platonic love , clouds ... '' he muttered . 
Whether it was the wine he had drunk , or an impulse of frankness , or the thought that this man did not , and never would , know any of those who played a part in his story , or whether it was all these things together , something loosened Pierre 's tongue . 
Speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes , he told the whole story of his life : his marriage , Natasha 's love for his best friend , her betrayal of him , and all his own simple relations with her . 
Urged on by Ramballe 's questions he also told what he had at first concealed -- his own position and even his name . 
More than anything else in Pierre 's story the captain was impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich , had two mansions in Moscow , and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city , but remained there concealing his name and station . 
When it was late at night they went out together into the street . 
The night was warm and light . 
To the left of the house on the Pokrovka a fire glowed -- the first of those that were beginning in Moscow . 
To the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre 's heart with his love .
