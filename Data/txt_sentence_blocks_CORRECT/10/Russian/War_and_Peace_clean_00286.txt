`` Ah ! 
mon ami , I only pray , and hope that God will hear me . 
Andrew ... '' she said timidly after a moment 's silence , `` I have a great favor to ask of you . '' 
`` What is it , dear ? '' 
`` No -- promise that you will not refuse ! 
It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you , but it will comfort me . 
Promise , Andrusha ! 
... '' said she , putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it , as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted . 
She looked timidly at her brother . 
`` Even if it were a great deal of trouble ... '' answered Prince Andrew , as if guessing what it was about .
