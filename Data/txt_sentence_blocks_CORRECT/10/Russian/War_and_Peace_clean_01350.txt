But not to speak of her alone , that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief . 
Then , at the moment of our loss , these thoughts could not occur to me ; I should then have dismissed them with horror , but now they are very clear and certain . 
I write all this to you , dear friend , only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life : not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will . 
And His will is governed only by infinite love for us , and so whatever befalls us is for our good . 
You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow . 
In spite of my wish to see you , I do not think so and do not want to do so . 
You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte ! 
The case is this : my father 's health is growing noticeably worse , he can not stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable . 
This irritability is , as you know , chiefly directed to political questions . 
He can not endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own , the grandson of the Great Catherine !
