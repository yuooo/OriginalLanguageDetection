Owing to his swollen legs , the old man could hardly walk at all , and was only rarely lifted from his leather armchair , when the old woman supporting him led him up and down the room once or twice . 
He was morose and taciturn even with this old woman . 
When he was informed of the arrival of the `` captain , '' he at once refused to see him . 
But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again . 
Samsonov questioned the lad minutely : What he looked like ? 
Whether he was drunk ? 
Was he going to make a row ? 
The answer he received was : that he was sober , but would n't go away . 
The old man again refused to see him . 
Then Mitya , who had foreseen this , and purposely brought pencil and paper with him , wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words : `` On most important business closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna , '' and sent it up to the old man .
