Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine , but latterly on Mademoiselle Bourienne 's advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him . 
Metivier came to see the prince about twice a week . 
On December 6 -- St. Nicholas ' Day and the prince 's name day -- all Moscow came to the prince 's front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number , a list of whom he gave to Princess Mary . 
Metivier , who came in the morning with his felicitations , considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne , * as he told Princess Mary , and went in to see the prince . 
It happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods . 
He had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself . 
Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness , which generally culminated in a burst of rage , and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion . 
Until the doctor 's arrival the morning had passed off safely . 
After admitting the doctor , Princess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study . 
* To force the guard .
