`` Forgive me ! '' 
he said . 
`` But you are so young , and I have already been through so much in life . 
I am afraid for you , you do not yet know yourself . '' 
Natasha listened with concentrated attention , trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words . 
`` Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be , '' continued Prince Andrew , `` it will give you time to be sure of yourself . 
I ask you to make me happy in a year , but you are free : our engagement shall remain a secret , and should you find that you do not love me , or should you come to love ... '' said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile . 
`` Why do you say that ? '' 
Natasha interrupted him . 
`` You know that from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you , '' she cried , quite convinced that she spoke the truth .
