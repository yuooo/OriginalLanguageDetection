`` Among them ? 
Among whom ? '' 
asked the monk , timidly . 
`` I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year , I have n't been since . 
I saw a devil sitting on one man 's chest hiding under his cassock , only his horns poked out ; another had one peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eyes , he was afraid of me ; another settled in the unclean belly of one , another was hanging round a man 's neck , and so he was carrying him about without seeing him . '' 
`` You - can see spirits ? '' 
the monk inquired . 
`` I tell you I can see , I can see through them . 
When I was coming out from the Superior 's I saw one hiding from me behind the door , and a big one , a yard and a half or more high , with a thick long grey tail , and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the door , pinching his tail in it . 
He squealed and began to struggle , and I made the sign of the cross over him three times .
