He felt that the being before him was quite different from , and better than , anyone he had met before , and above all better than himself . 
Their conversation was very simple and unimportant . 
They spoke of the war , and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it ; they spoke of their last meeting -- Nicholas trying to change the subject -- they talked of the governor 's kind wife , of Nicholas ' relations , and of Princess Mary 's . 
She did not talk about her brother , diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew . 
Evidently she could speak of Russia 's misfortunes with a certain artificiality , but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him . 
Nicholas noticed this , as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary 's character with an observation unusual to him , and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being . 
Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess -LRB- as she did when he was mentioned -RRB- and even when he thought of her , but in her presence he felt quite at ease , and said not at all what he had prepared , but what , quite appropriately , occurred to him at the moment . 
When a pause occurred during his short visit , Nicholas , as is usual when there are children , turned to Prince Andrew 's little son , caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar . 
He took the boy on his knee , played with him , and looked round at Princess Mary . 
With a softened , happy , timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved .
