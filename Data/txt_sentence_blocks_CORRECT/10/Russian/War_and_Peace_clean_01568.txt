We never hear a word but Dolokhov is mentioned . 
They swear by him , they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet . 
Dolokhov and Anatole Kuragin have turned all our ladies ' heads . '' 
A tall , beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck , round which she wore a double string of large pearls , entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place . 
Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck , those shoulders , and pearls and coiffure , and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls . 
While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and , meeting the count 's eyes , nodded to him and smiled . 
She was the Countess Bezukhova , Pierre 's wife , and the count , who knew everyone in society , leaned over and spoke to her . 
`` Have you been here long , Countess ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` I 'll call , I 'll call to kiss your hand .
