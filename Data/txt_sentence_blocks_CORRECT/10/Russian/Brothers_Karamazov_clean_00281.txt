Alyosha made up his mind to wait . 
He felt that , perhaps , indeed , his work lay here . 
Mitya sank into thought for a moment , with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand . 
Both were silent . 
`` Alyosha , '' said Mitya , `` you 're the only one who wo n't laugh . 
I should like to begin - my confession - with Schiller 's Hymn to Joy , An die Freude ! 
I do n't know German , I only know it 's called that . 
Do n't think I 'm talking nonsense because I 'm drunk . 
I 'm not a bit drunk . 
Brandy 's all very well , but I need two bottles to make me drunk : Silenus with his rosy phiz Upon his stumbling ass .
