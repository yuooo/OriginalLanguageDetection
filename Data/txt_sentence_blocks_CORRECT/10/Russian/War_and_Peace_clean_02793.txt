I think I could ? '' 
he returned , inquiringly . 
`` Well , all wight , '' said Denisov . 
And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman 's hut in the forest , and told the officer on the Kirghiz horse -LRB- who performed the duties of an adjutant -RRB- to go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening . 
Denisov himself intended going with the esaul and Petya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo , to have a look at the part of the French bivouac they were to attack next day . 
`` Well , old fellow , '' said he to the peasant guide , `` lead us to Shamshevo . '' 
Denisov , Petya , and the esaul , accompanied by some Cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner , rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest . 
The rain had stopped , and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees . 
Denisov , the esaul , and Petya rode silently , following the peasant in the knitted cap who , stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves , silently led them to the edge of the forest . 
He ascended an incline , stopped , looked about him , and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense .
