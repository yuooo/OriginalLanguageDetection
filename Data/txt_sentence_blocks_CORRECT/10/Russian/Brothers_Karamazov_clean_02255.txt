He would have invented something , he would have told some lie if he had been forced to give information , but he would have been silent about that . 
For , on the other hand , if he had said nothing about the money , but had committed the murder and stolen the money , no one in the world could have charged him with murder for the sake of robbery , since no one but he had seen the money , no one but he knew of its existence in the house . 
Even if he had been accused of the murder , it could only have been thought that he had committed it from some other motive . 
But since no one had observed any such motive in him beforehand , and everyone saw , on the contrary , that his master was fond of him and honoured him with his confidence , he would , of course , have been the last to be suspected . 
People would have suspected first the man who had a motive , a man who had himself declared he had such motives , who had made no secret of it ; they would , in fact , have suspected the son of the murdered man , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
Had Smerdyakov killed and robbed him , and the son been accused of it , that would , of course , have suited Smerdyakov . 
Yet are we to believe that , though plotting the murder , he told that son , Dmitri , about the money , the envelope , and the signals ? 
Is that logical ? 
Is that clear ? 
`` When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came , we have him falling downstairs in a feigned fit - with what object ?
