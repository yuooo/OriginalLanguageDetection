cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went , with the smile of a coquettish girl , which at one time probably came naturally to her , but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face . 
Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts . 
But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold , artificial expression . 
She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking , and again pretended to listen , while waiting till it would be time to leave . 
Her task was accomplished . 
`` And what do you think of this latest comedy , the coronation at Milan ? '' 
asked Anna Pavlovna , `` and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte , and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations ? 
Adorable ! 
It is enough to make one 's head whirl ! 
It is as if the whole world had gone crazy . ''
