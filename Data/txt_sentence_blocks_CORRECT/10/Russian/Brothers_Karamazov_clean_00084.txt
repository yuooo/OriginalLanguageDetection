`` You mean about Diderot ? '' 
`` No , not about Diderot . 
Above all , do n't lie to yourself . 
The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he can not distinguish the truth within him , or around him , and so loses all respect for himself and for others . 
And having no respect he ceases to love , and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures , and sinks to bestiality in his vices , all from continual lying to other men and to himself . 
The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than anyone . 
You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offence , is n't it ? 
A man may know that nobody has insulted him , but that he has invented the insult for himself , has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque , has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill - he knows that himself , yet he will be the first to take offence , and will revel in his resentment till he feels great pleasure in it , and so pass to genuine vindictiveness . 
But get up , sit down , I beg you . 
All this , too , is deceitful posturing ... '' `` Blessed man !
