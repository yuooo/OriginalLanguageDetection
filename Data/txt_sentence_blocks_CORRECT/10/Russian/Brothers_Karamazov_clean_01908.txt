Though I say that Ivan is superior to us , you are my angel . 
It 's your decision will decide it . 
Perhaps it 's you that is superior and not Ivan . 
You see , it 's a question of conscience , question of the higher conscience - the secret is so important that I ca n't settle it myself , and I 've put it off till I could speak to you . 
But anyway it 's too early to decide now , for we must wait for the verdict . 
As soon as the verdict is given , you shall decide my fate . 
Do n't decide it now . 
I 'll tell you now . 
You listen , but do n't decide . 
Stand and keep quiet .
