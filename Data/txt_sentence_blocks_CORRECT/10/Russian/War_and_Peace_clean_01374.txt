Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch . 
There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog . 
Milka , a black-spotted , broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes , got up on seeing her master , stretched her hind legs , lay down like a hare , and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache . 
Another borzoi , a dog , catching sight of his master from the garden path , arched his back and , rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail , began rubbing himself against his legs . 
`` O-hoy ! '' 
came at that moment , that inimitable huntsman 's call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor , and round the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman , a gray , wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead , Ukrainian fashion , a long bent whip in his hand , and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen . 
He doffed his Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully . 
This scorn was not offensive to his master . 
Nicholas knew that this Daniel , disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them , was all the same his serf and huntsman . 
`` Daniel ! ''
