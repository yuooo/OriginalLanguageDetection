`` Brother , I can not stay long , '' Alyosha said , after a pause . 
`` To-morrow will be a great and awful day for you , the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you , you walk about here , talking of I do n't know what ... '' `` No , do n't be amazed at me , '' Mitya broke in warmly . 
`` Am I to talk of that stinking dog ? 
Of the murderer ? 
We 've talked enough of him . 
I do n't want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta ! 
God will kill him , you will see . 
Hush ! '' 
He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him . 
His eyes glowed .
