Prince Andrew 's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly , and nodding to Bolkonski , but not pausing , went into the study , giving instructions to his adjutant as he went . 
The Emperor was following him , and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign . 
Chernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch , where the Emperor , who looked fatigued , was dismounting . 
Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor , with his head bent to the left , was listening with a dissatisfied air . 
The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation , but the flushed and excited Italian , oblivious of decorum , followed him and continued to speak . 
`` And as for the man who advised forming this camp -- the Drissa camp , '' said Paulucci , as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face , `` as to that person , sire ... '' continued Paulucci , desperately , apparently unable to restrain himself , `` the man who advised the Drissa camp -- I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows ! '' 
Without heeding the end of the Italian 's remarks , and as though not hearing them , the Emperor , recognizing Bolkonski , addressed him graciously . 
`` I am very glad to see you ! 
Go in there where they are meeting , and wait for me . '' 
The Emperor went into the study .
