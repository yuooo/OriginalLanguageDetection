He did not know why , but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar 's hand and he felt that he must not give way . 
He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit ; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground -- she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them . 
Petya pushed her hand away with his knee , seized a biscuit , and as if fearing to be too late , again shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
with a voice already hoarse . 
The Emperor went in , and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse . 
`` There ! 
I said if only we waited -- and so it was ! '' 
was being joyfully said by various people . 
Happy as Petya was , he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over . 
He did not go straight home from the Kremlin , but called on his friend Obolenski , who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment .
