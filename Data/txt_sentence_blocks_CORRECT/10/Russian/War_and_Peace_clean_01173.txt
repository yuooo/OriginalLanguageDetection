Rostov stood at that corner for a long time , watching the feast from a distance . 
In his mind , a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion . 
Terrible doubts rose in his soul . 
Now he remembered Denisov with his changed expression , his submission , and the whole hospital , with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease . 
So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from . 
Next he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte , with his small white hand , who was now an Emperor , liked and respected by Alexander . 
Then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men ? 
... Then again he thought of Lazarev rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned . 
He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened .
