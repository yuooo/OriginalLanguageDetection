`` Very well , I will come , '' Alyosha decided , after rapidly scanning the brief , enigmatic note , which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would come , without any sort of explanation .

`` I told mamma you 'd be sure not to go .

How splendid you are I 've always thought you were splendid . 
How glad I am to tell you so ! '' 
`` Lise ! ''
