All that was distressing , and especially all that was humiliating , in her position rose vividly to her mind . 
`` They , the French , would settle in this house : M. le General Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew 's study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of Bogucharovo for him .
