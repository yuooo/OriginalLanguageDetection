Moreover , certain men wrote some books at that time . 
At the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal . 
This caused people all over France to begin to slash at and drown one another . 
They killed the king and many other people . 
At that time there was in France a man of genius -- Napoleon . 
He conquered everybody everywhere -- that is , he killed many people because he was a great genius . 
And for some reason he went to kill Africans , and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to France he ordered everybody to obey him , and they all obeyed him . 
Having become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy , Austria , and Prussia . 
And there too he killed a great many . 
In Russia there was an Emperor , Alexander , who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon .
