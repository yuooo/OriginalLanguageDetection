All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was , however , redeemed by his kindly , simple , and modest expression . 
Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and , with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion , nodded and said : `` I hope to see you again , but I also hope you will change your opinions , my dear Monsieur Pierre . '' 
When she said this , he did not reply and only bowed , but again everybody saw his smile , which said nothing , unless perhaps , `` Opinions are opinions , but you see what a capital , good-natured fellow I am . '' 
And everyone , including Anna Pavlovna , felt this . 
Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall , and , turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak , listened indifferently to his wife 's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall . 
Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty , pregnant princess , and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass . 
`` Go in , Annette , or you will catch cold , '' said the little princess , taking leave of Anna Pavlovna . 
`` It is settled , '' she added in a low voice . 
Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess ' sister-in-law . 
`` I rely on you , my dear , '' said Anna Pavlovna , also in a low tone .
