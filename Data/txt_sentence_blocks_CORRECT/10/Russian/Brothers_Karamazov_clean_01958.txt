`` But if you say yourself that it could n't be guessed , how could I have guessed and stayed at home ? 
You contradict yourself ! '' 
said Ivan , pondering . 
`` You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow . '' 
`` How could I guess it from that ? '' 
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted , and again he was silent for a minute . 
`` You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya , that I wanted to have you nearer , for Moscow 's a long way off , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch , knowing you are not far off , would not be so bold . 
And if anything had happened , you might have come to protect me , too , for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch 's illness , and that I was afraid of having a fit . 
And when I explained those knocks to you , by means of which one could go in to the deceased , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me , I thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do something , and so would n't go to Tchermashnya even , but would stay . '' 
`` He talks very coherently , '' thought Ivan , `` though he does mumble ; what 's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of ? ''
