What a position for the Emperor to be in ! 
Kutuzov was a traitor , and Prince Vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter 's death said of Kutuzov , whom he had formerly praised -LRB- it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said -RRB- , that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man . 
`` I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a man . '' 
As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it , but the next day the following communication was received from Count Rostopchin : Prince Kutuzov 's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road . 
He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow . 
Sire ! 
Kutuzov 's action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire ! 
Russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors ! 
I shall follow the army . 
I have had everything removed , and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland .
