Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back . 
Rostov , picking out one on a gray horse , dashed after him . 
On the way he came upon a bush , his gallant horse cleared it , and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected . 
That Frenchman , by his uniform an officer , was going at a gallop , crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber . 
In another moment Rostov 's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer 's horse , almost knocking it over , and at the same instant Rostov , without knowing why , raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it . 
The instant he had done this , all Rostov 's animation vanished . 
The officer fell , not so much from the blow -- which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow -- as from the shock to his horse and from fright . 
Rostov reined in his horse , and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished . 
The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground , the other being caught in the stirrup . 
His eyes , screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow , gazed up at Rostov with shrinking terror .
