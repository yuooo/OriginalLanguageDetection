A peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her . 
Her life had no external aims -- only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent . 
She had to eat , sleep , think , speak , weep , work , give vent to her anger , and so on , merely because she had a stomach , a brain , muscles , nerves , and a liver . 
She did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do , when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed . 
She talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs . 
She cried as a child does , because her nose had to be cleared , and so on . 
What for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext . 
Thus in the morning -- especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before -- she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext Belova 's deafness . 
She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room . 
`` It seems a little warmer today , my dear , '' she would murmur .
