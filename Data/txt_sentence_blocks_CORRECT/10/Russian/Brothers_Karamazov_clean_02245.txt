I must confess , too , that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe . 
` To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from everyone , ' as he writes in his peculiar language , ' and if they wo n't give it to me , there will be bloodshed . ' '' 
Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya 's efforts to borrow the money . 
He described his visit to Samsonov , his journey to Lyagavy . 
`` Harassed , jeered at , hungry , after selling his watch to pay for the journey -LRB- though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles on him - a likely story -RRB- , tortured by jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town , suspecting that she would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absense , he returned at last to the town , to find , to his joy , that she had not been near his father . 
He accompanied her himself to her protector . 
-LRB- Strange to say , he does n't seem to have been jealous of Samsonov , which is psychologically interesting . -RRB- 
Then he hastens back to his ambush in the back gardens , and then learns that Smerdyakov is in a fit , that the other servant is ill - the coast is clear and he knows the ` signals ' - what a temptation ! 
Still he resists it ; he goes off to a lady who has for some time been residing in the town , and who is highly esteemed among us , Madame Hohlakov . 
That lady , who had long watched his career with compassion , gave him the most judicious advice , to give up his dissipated life , his unseemly love-affair , the waste of his youth and vigour in pot-house debauchery , and to set off to Siberia to the gold mines : ` that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies , your romantic character , your thirst for adventure .
