The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers . 
`` Oh , the coxcombs ! '' 
he muttered reproachfully . 
`` It 's not the soldiers only , but I 've seen peasants today , too ... . 
The peasants -- even they have to go , '' said the soldier behind the cart , addressing Pierre with a sad smile . 
`` No distinctions made nowadays ... . 
They want the whole nation to fall on them -- in a word , it 's Moscow ! 
They want to make an end of it . '' 
In spite of the obscurity of the soldier 's words Pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval . 
The road was clear again ; Pierre descended the hill and drove on .
