By the expression of her father 's face , not sad , not crushed , but angry and working unnaturally , she saw that hanging over her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune , the worst in life , one she had not yet experienced , irreparable and incomprehensible -- the death of one she loved . 
`` Father ! 
Andrew ! '' 
-- said the ungraceful , awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob . 
`` Bad news ! 
He 's not among the prisoners nor among the killed ! 
Kutuzov writes ... '' and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the princess away by that scream ... `` Killed ! '' 
The princess did not fall down or faint . 
She was already pale , but on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her beautiful , radiant eyes . 
It was as if joy -- a supreme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of this world -- overflowed the great grief within her .
