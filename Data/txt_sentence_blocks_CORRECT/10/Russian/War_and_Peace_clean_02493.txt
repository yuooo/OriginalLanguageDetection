Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady , the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband . 
Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind . 
He began to explain that he understood love for a women somewhat differently . 
He said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman , and that she could never be his . 
`` Tiens ! '' 
said the captain . 
Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years , but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young , and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name . 
Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well , placing her far above everything in the world , and especially therefore above himself . 
When he had reached this point , Pierre asked the captain whether he understood that .
