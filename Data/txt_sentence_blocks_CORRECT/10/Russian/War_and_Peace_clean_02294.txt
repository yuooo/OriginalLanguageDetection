Wishing to speak and to attract their attention , he got up , but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare . 
He felt ashamed , and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped . 
For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs , posts , and yard , but now they were all bluish , lit up , and glittering with frost or dew . 
`` It is dawn , '' thought Pierre . 
`` But that 's not what I want . 
I want to hear and understand my benefactor 's words . '' 
Again he covered himself up with his cloak , but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there . 
There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words , thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating . 
Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them , though the impressions of that day had evoked them . 
He had never , it seemed to him , been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake .
