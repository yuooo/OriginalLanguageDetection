But to this day it exists in few monasteries only , and has sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia . 
It flourished especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery . 
When and how it was introduced into our monastery I can not say . 
There had already been three such elders and Zossima was the last of them . 
But he was almost dying of weakness and disease , and they had no one to take his place . 
The question for our monastery was an important one , for it had not been distinguished by anything in particular till then : they had neither relics of saints , nor wonder - working ikons , nor glorious traditions , nor historical exploits . 
It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its elders , to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts . 
What was such an elder ? 
An elder was one who took your soul , your will , into his soul and his will . 
When you choose an elder , you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission , complete self-abnegation .
