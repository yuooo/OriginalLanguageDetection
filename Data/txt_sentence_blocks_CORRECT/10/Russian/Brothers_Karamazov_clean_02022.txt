`` Stop ... I am getting mixed . 
Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him ; you only took the money ? '' 
`` No , he did n't kill him . 
Well , I might as well have told you now that he was the murderer ... . 
But I do n't want to lie to you now because ... because if you really have n't understood till now , as I see for myself , and are not pretending , so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face , you are still responsible for it all , since you knew of the murder and charged me to do it , and went away knowing all about it . 
And so I want to prove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair , and I am not the real murderer , though I did kill him . 
You are the rightful murderer . '' 
`` Why , why , am I a murderer ? 
Oh , God ! '' 
Ivan cried , unable to restrain himself at last , and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself till the end of the conversation .
