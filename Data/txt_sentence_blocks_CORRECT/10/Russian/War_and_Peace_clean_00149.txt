Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself . 
`` And it must seem to you , '' said Boris flushing slightly , but not changing his tone or attitude , `` it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man ? '' 
`` So it does , '' thought Pierre . 
`` But I just wish to say , to avoid misunderstandings , that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people . 
We are very poor , but for my own part at any rate , for the very reason that your father is rich , I do n't regard myself as a relation of his , and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him . '' 
For a long time Pierre could not understand , but when he did , he jumped up from the sofa , seized Boris under the elbow in his quick , clumsy way , and , blushing far more than Boris , began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation . 
`` Well , this is strange ! 
Do you suppose I. . . 
who could think ?
