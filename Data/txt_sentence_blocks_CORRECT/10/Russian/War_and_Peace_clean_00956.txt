`` Oh , those Moscow gossips ! '' 
said Dolokhov , and he took up the cards with a smile . 
`` Aah ! '' 
Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head . 
The seven he needed was lying uppermost , the first card in the pack . 
He had lost more than he could pay . 
`` Still , do n't ruin yourself ! '' 
said Dolokhov with a side glance at Rostov as he continued to deal . 
An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play . 
The whole interest was concentrated on Rostov .
