She was the belle of the balls and picnics , and they got up tableaux vivants in aid of distressed governesses . 
I took no notice , I went on as wildly as before , and one of my exploits at the time set all the town talking . 
I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the battery commander 's , but I did n't go up to her , as though I disdained her acquaintance . 
I did go up and speak to her at an evening party not long after . 
She scarcely looked at me , and compressed her lips scornfully . 
` Wait a bit . 
I 'll have my revenge , ' thought I. I behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time , and I was conscious of it myself . 
What made it worse was that I felt that ` Katenka ' was not an innocent boarding-school miss , but a person of character , proud and really high-principled ; above all , she had education and intellect , and I had neither . 
You think I meant to make her an offer ? 
No , I simply wanted to revenge myself , because I was such a hero and she did n't seem to feel it .
