`` Were n't you asleep ? '' 
`` No , I did not sleep , '' said Princess Mary , shaking her head . 
Unconsciously imitating her father , she now tried to express herself as he did , as much as possible by signs , and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty . 
`` Dear one ... Dearest ... '' Princess Mary could not quite make out what he had said , but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before . 
`` Why did n't you come in ? '' 
`` And I was wishing for his death ! '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
He was silent awhile . 
`` Thank you ... daughter dear ! 
... for all , for all ... forgive !
