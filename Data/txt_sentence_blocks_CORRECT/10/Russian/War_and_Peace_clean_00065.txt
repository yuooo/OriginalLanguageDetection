`` Lise ! '' 
said Prince Andrew dryly , raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted . 
Suddenly the angry , squirrel-like expression of the princess ' pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear . 
Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband 's face , and her own assumed the timid , deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail . 
`` Mon Dieu , mon Dieu ! '' 
she muttered , and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead . 
`` Good night , Lise , '' said he , rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger . 
The friends were silent . 
Neither cared to begin talking . 
Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew ; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand .
