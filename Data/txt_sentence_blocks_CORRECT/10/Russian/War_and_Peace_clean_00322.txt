Kutuzov turned away . 
The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timokhin again flitted over his face . 
He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him , that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted . 
He turned away and went to the carriage . 
The regiment broke up into companies , which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau , where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches . 
`` You wo n't bear me a grudge , Prokhor Ignatych ? '' 
said the regimental commander , overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front . 
-LRB- The regimental commander 's face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight . -RRB- 
`` It 's in the Emperor 's service ... it ca n't be helped ... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade ... I am the first to apologize , you know me ! 
... He was very pleased ! ''
