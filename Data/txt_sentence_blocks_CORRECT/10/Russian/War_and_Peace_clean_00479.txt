Kutuzov went out into the porch with Bagration . 
`` Well , good-by , Prince , '' said he to Bagration . 
`` My blessing , and may Christ be with you in your great endeavor ! ''

With his left hand he drew Bagration toward him , and with his right , on which he wore a ring , he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual , offering his puffy cheek , but Bagration kissed him on the neck instead . 
`` Christ be with you ! ''

`` Get in with me , '' said he to Bolkonski .
