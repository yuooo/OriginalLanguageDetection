There was , however , an element of comedy about it , through the difference of opinion of the doctors . 
The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow , our doctor , Herzenstube , and the young doctor , Varvinsky . 
The two latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution . 
The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube . 
He was a grey and bald old man of seventy , of middle height and sturdy build . 
He was much esteemed and respected by everyone in the town . 
He was a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man , a Hernguter or Moravian brother , I am not quite sure which . 
He had been living amongst us for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity . 
He was a kind-hearted and humane man . 
He treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing , visited them in their slums and huts , and left money for medicine , but he was as obstinate as a mule .
