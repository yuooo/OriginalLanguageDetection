`` Get along with you , Jesuits ! '' 
he cried to the servants . 
`` Go away , Smerdyakov . 
I 'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day , but be off ! 
Do n't cry , Grigory . 
Go to Marfa . 
She 'll comfort you and put you to bed . 
The rascals wo n't let us sit in peace after dinner , '' he snapped peevishly , as the servants promptly withdrew at his word .
