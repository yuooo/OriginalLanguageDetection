I stand and look about me and see that scarcely anyone else cares ; no one troubles his head about it , and I 'm the only one who ca n't stand it .

`` No doubt . 
But there 's no proving it , though you can be convinced of it . '' 
`` By the experience of active love . 
Strive to love your neighbour actively and indefatigably . 
In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul . 
If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbour , then you will believe without doubt , and no doubt can possibly enter your soul . 
This has been tried . 
This is certain . ''
