Princess Mary , pale and with quivering chin , came out from that room and taking Natasha by the arm said something to her . 
Natasha neither saw nor heard her . 
She went in with rapid steps , pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself , and then ran to her mother . 
The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position , stretching out and beating her head against the wall . 
Sonya and the maids were holding her arms . 
`` Natasha ! 
Natasha ! 
... '' cried the countess . 
`` It 's not true ... it 's not true ... He 's lying ... Natasha ! '' 
she shrieked , pushing those around her away .
