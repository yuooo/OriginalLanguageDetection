`` You see , we have come to the elder upon business of our own , '' observed Miusov severely . 
`` That personage has granted us an audience , so to speak , and so , though we thank you for showing us the way , we can not ask you to accompany us . '' 
`` I 've been there . 
I 've been already ; un chevalier parfait , '' and Maximov snapped his fingers in the air . 
`` Who is a chevalier ? '' 
asked Miusov . 
`` The elder , the splendid elder , the elder ! 
The honour and glory of the monastery , Zossima . 
Such an elder ! ''
