Dunyasha , her maid , entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress . 
`` Come to your Papa at once , please ! '' 
said she with a strange , excited look . 
`` A misfortune ... about Peter Ilynich ... a letter , '' she finished with a sob . 
Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family . 
All of them -- her father , mother , and Sonya -- were so near to her , so familiar , so commonplace , that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late , and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility . 
She heard Dunyasha 's words about Peter Ilynich and a misfortune , but did not grasp them . 
`` What misfortune ? 
What misfortune can happen to them ? 
They just live their own old , quiet , and commonplace life , '' thought Natasha .
