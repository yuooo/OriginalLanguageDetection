Kutuzov did not understand what Europe , the balance of power , or Napoleon meant . 
He could not understand it . 
For the representative of the Russian people , after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory , there was nothing left to do as a Russian . 
Nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die , and Kutuzov died . 
As generally happens , Pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over . 
After his liberation he reached Orel , and on the third day there , when preparing to go to Kiev , he fell ill and was laid up for three months . 
He had what the doctors termed `` bilious fever . '' 
But despite the fact that the doctors treated him , bled him , and gave him medicines to drink , he recovered . 
Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre 's mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness . 
He remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy , internal physical distress , and pains in his feet and side .
