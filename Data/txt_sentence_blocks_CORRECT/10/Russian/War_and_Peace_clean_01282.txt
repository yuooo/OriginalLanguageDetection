Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor 's presence , and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance . 
Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm . 
`` You always dance . 
I have a protegee , the young Rostova , here . 
Ask her , '' he said . 
`` Where is she ? '' 
asked Bolkonski . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
he added , turning to the baron , `` we will finish this conversation elsewhere -- at a ball one must dance . '' 
He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated .
