No disgrace to a hero , not even a Caesar ! 
But do n't ever beg her pardon all the same for anything . 
Remember that rule given you by your brother Mitya , who 's come to ruin through women . 
No , I 'd better make it up to Grusha somehow , without begging pardon . 
I worship her , Alexey , worship her . 
Only she does n't see it . 
No , she still thinks I do n't love her enough . 
And she tortures me , tortures me with her love . 
The past was nothing ! 
In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me , but now I 've taken all her soul into my soul and through her I 've become a man myself .
