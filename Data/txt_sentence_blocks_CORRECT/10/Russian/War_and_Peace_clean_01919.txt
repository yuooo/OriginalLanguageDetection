The innkeeper stood at the gate . 
`` What are you staring at ? '' 
he shouted to the cook , who in her red skirt , with sleeves rolled up , swinging her bare elbows , had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said . 
`` What marvels ! '' 
she exclaimed , but hearing her master 's voice she turned back , pulling down her tucked-up skirt . 
Once more something whistled , but this time quite close , swooping downwards like a little bird ; a flame flashed in the middle of the street , something exploded , and the street was shrouded in smoke . 
`` Scoundrel , what are you doing ? ''
