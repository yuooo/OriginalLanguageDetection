Nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come from Petersburg . 
There was no general plan of action . 
The vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month . 
Each of the three armies had its own commander in chief , but there was no supreme commander of all the forces , and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility himself . 
The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody - tired of waiting -- prepare for the war . 
All the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending . 
In June , after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates , by the courtiers , and by the Emperor himself , it occurred to one of the Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp . 
This idea was eagerly received . 
The Emperor gave his consent . 
The aides-de-camp collected money by subscription .
