`` Well , are they feasting ? 
Have they money ? '' 
`` Poor sort of a feast ! 
Nothing to boast of , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Nothing to boast of ? 
And who are the others ? '' 
`` They 're two gentlemen from the town ... . 
They 've come back from Tcherny , and are putting up here . 
One 's quite a young gentleman , a relative of Mr. Miusov he must be , but I 've forgotten his name ... and I expect you know the other , too , a gentleman called Maximov . 
He 's been on a pilgrimage , so he says , to the monastery in the town .
