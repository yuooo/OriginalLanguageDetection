On the contrary , I am very glad to make your acquaintance , '' said Pierre . 
And again , glancing at the stranger 's hands , he looked more closely at the ring , with its skull -- a Masonic sign . 
`` Allow me to ask , '' he said , `` are you a Mason ? '' 
`` Yes , I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons , '' said the stranger , looking deeper and deeper into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` And in their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you . '' 
`` I am afraid , '' said Pierre , smiling , and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs -- `` I am afraid I am very far from understanding -- how am I to put it ? 
-- I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another . '' 
`` I know your outlook , '' said the Mason , `` and the view of life you mention , and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts , is the one held by the majority of people , and is the invariable fruit of pride , indolence , and ignorance . 
Forgive me , my dear sir , but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you . 
Your view of life is a regrettable delusion . ''
