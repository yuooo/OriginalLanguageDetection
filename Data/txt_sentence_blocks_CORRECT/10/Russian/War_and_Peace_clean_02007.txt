After sunset the wind had dropped . 
The night was calm and fresh . 
Toward midnight the voices began to subside , a cock crowed , the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees , a fresh white dewy mist began to rise , and stillness reigned over the village and the house . 
Pictures of the near past -- her father 's illness and last moments - rose one after another to her memory . 
With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images , repelling with horror only the last one , the picture of his death , which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night . 
And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present , now past , and now future . 
She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills , muttering something with his helpless tongue , twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her . 
`` Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died , '' she thought . 
`` He had always thought what he said then . '' 
And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke , when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will .
