You shall black my shoes , Rakitin , that 's the place you are fit for . 
You 'll never get a woman like me ... and he wo n't either , perhaps ... '' `` Wo n't he ? 
Then why are you dressed up like that ? '' 
said Rakitin , with a venomous sneer . 
`` Do n't taunt me with dressing up , Rakitin , you do n't know all that is in my heart ! 
If I choose to tear off my finery , I 'll tear it off at once , this minute , '' she cried in a resonant voice . 
`` You do n't know what that finery is for , Rakitin ! 
Perhaps I shall see him and say : ` Have you ever seen me look like this before ? ' 
He left me a thin , consumptive cry-baby of seventeen . 
I 'll sit by him , fascinate him and work him up .
