She entered with a stern and gloomy face , that looked almost composed , and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
She was very pale , she seemed to be cold , and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl . 
She was suffering from a slight feverish chill - the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night . 
Her grave air , her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favourable impression on everyone . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit `` fascinated . '' 
He admitted himself , when talking about it afterwards , that only then had he seen `` how handsome the woman was , '' for , though he had seen her several times he had always looked upon her as something of a `` provincial hetaira . '' 
`` She has the manners of the best society , '' he said enthusiastically , gossiping about her in a circle of ladies . 
But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies , who immediately called him a `` naughty man , '' to his great satisfaction . 
As she entered the room , Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya , who looked at her uneasily . 
But her face reassured him at once .
