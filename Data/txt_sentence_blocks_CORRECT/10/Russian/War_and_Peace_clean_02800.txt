In Denisov 's party he held a peculiar and exceptional position . 
When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done -- to push a cart out of the mud with one 's shoulders , pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail , skin it , slink in among the French , or walk more than thirty miles in a day -- everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon . 
`` It wo n't hurt that devil -- he 's as strong as a horse ! '' 
they said of him . 
Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back . 
That wound -LRB- which Tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka -RRB- was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment - jokes in which Tikhon readily joined . 
`` Hallo , mate ! 
Never again ? 
Gave you a twist ? '' 
the Cossacks would banter him .
