Government clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms . 
The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French . 
The owners of houses in which much property had been left , brought there from other houses , complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin ; others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different houses into this or that house , it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there . 
They abused the police and bribed them , made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire , and demanded relief . 
And Count Rostopchin wrote proclamations . 
At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned . 
He called on Count Rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow , and he intended to leave for Petersburg two days later . 
Everybody was celebrating the victory , everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city . 
Everyone was pleased to see Pierre , everyone wished to meet him , and everyone questioned him about what he had seen . 
Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all , but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way .
