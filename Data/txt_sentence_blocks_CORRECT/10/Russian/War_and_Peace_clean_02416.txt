This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town , as the army was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond Moscow . 
This was not news to Rostopchin . 
He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever since the battle of Borodino , for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle , and since then the government property had been removed every night , and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchin 's own permission . 
Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count , coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from Kutuzov , and received at night , breaking in on his beauty sleep . 
When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his actions at this time , he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations : to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants . 
If one accepts this twofold aim all Rostopchin 's actions appear irreproachable . 
`` Why were the holy relics , the arms , ammunition , gunpowder , and stores of corn not removed ? 
Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would not be given up -- and thereby ruined ? '' 
`` To presence the tranquillity of the city , '' explains Count Rostopchin . 
`` Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices , and Leppich 's balloon and other articles removed ? ''
