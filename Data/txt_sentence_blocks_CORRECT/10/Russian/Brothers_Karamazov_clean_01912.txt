There 's no one else . 
It 's folly , madness to others , all I 've told you of the hymn . 
They 'll say I 'm out of my mind or a fool . 
I am not out of my mind and I am not a fool . 
Ivan understands about the hymn , too . 
He understands , only he does n't answer - he does n't speak . 
He does n't believe in the hymn . 
Do n't speak , do n't speak . 
I see how you look ! 
You have already decided .
