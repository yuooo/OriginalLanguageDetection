He had very important business of his own before him , something almost mysterious . 
Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya , with whom he could have left the children , would not come back from market . 
He had several times already crossed the passage , opened the door of the lodgers ' room and looked anxiously at `` the kids '' who were sitting over the book , as he had bidden them . 
Every time he opened the door they grinned at him , hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing . 
But Kolya was bothered and did not go in . 
At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind , once for all , that if that `` damned '' Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out without waiting for her , making `` the kids '' promise , of course , to be brave when he was away , not to be naughty , not to cry from fright . 
With this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar , slung his satchel round his shoulder , and , regardless of his mother 's constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold weather , he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on . 
Perezvon , seeing him in his outdoor clothes , began tapping nervously , yet vigorously , on the floor with his tail . 
Twitching all over , he even uttered a plaintive whine .
