It was about that plan of escape . 
He had told me the main idea three days before , and we began quarrelling about it at once and quarrelled for three days . 
We quarrelled because , when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature , I felt furious at once - I ca n't tell you why , I do n't know myself why ... . 
Oh , of course , I was furious then about that creature , and that she , too , should go abroad with Dmitri ! '' 
Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly , her lips quivering with anger . 
`` As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman , he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri . 
That is how our first quarrel began . 
I would not give an explanation , I could not ask forgiveness . 
I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri , that I loved no one but him ! 
It was only resentment against that creature that made me angry with him .
