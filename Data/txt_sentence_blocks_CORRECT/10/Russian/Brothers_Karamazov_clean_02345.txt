You will see , you will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck . 
` How can I endure this mercy ? 
How can I endure so much love ? 
Am I worthy of it ? ' 
That 's what he will exclaim . 
`` Oh , I know , I know that heart , that wild but grateful heart , gentlemen of the jury ! 
It will bow before your mercy ; it thirsts for a great and loving action , it will melt and mount upwards . 
There are souls which , in their limitation , blame the whole world . 
But subdue such a soul with mercy , show it love , and it will curse its past , for there are many good impulses in it . 
Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and just .
