His shot just grazed my cheek and ear . 
`` Thank God , '' I cried , `` no man has been killed , '' and I seized my pistol , turned back and flung it far away into the wood . 
`` That 's the place for you , '' I cried . 
I turned to my adversary . 
`` Forgive me , young fool that I am , sir , '' I said , `` for my unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me . 
I am ten times worse than you and more , maybe . 
Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the world . '' 
I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me . 
`` Upon my word , '' cried my adversary , annoyed , `` if you did not want to fight , why did not you let me alone ? '' 
`` Yesterday I was a fool , to-day I know better , '' I answered him gaily .
