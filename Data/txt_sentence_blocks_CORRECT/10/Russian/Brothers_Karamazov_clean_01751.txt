What an eye you 've got , I say ! 
I bet that was when I was talking about the goose . 
That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off , and for a moment I quite hated you for it , and began talking like a fool . 
Then I fancied - just now , here - when I said that if there were no God He would have to be invented , that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge , especially as I got that phrase out of a book . 
But I swear I was n't showing off out of vanity , though I really do n't know why . 
Because I was so pleased ? 
Yes , I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it 's perfectly disgraceful for anyone to be gushing directly they are pleased , I know that . 
But I am convinced now that you do n't despise me ; it was all my imagination . 
Oh , Karamazov , I am profoundly unhappy . 
I sometimes fancy all sorts of things , that everyone is laughing at me , the whole world , and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things . ''
