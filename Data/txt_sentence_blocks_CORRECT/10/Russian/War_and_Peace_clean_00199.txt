Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess ' room . 
In this room it was almost dark ; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles . 
The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture , whatnots , cupboards , and little tables . 
The quilt of a high , white feather bed was just visible behind a screen . 
A small dog began to bark . 
`` Ah , is it you , cousin ? '' 
She rose and smoothed her hair , which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish . 
`` Has anything happened ? '' 
she asked . 
`` I am so terrified . ''
