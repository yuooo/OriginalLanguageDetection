`` A bayonet wound . 
I remained at the front . 
Remember , your excellency ! '' 
Tushin 's battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagration , still hearing the cannonade in the center , send his orderly staff officer , and later Prince Andrew also , to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible . 
When the supports attached to Tushin 's battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone 's order , the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns . 
On the contrary , the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that here -- in the center - the main Russian forces were concentrated . 
Twice they had attempted to attack this point , but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock . 
Soon after Prince Bagration had left him , Tushin had succeeded in setting fire to Schon Grabern . 
`` Look at them scurrying ! 
It 's burning !
