`` It 's not the fifteen hundred that 's the disgrace , but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand , '' said Mitya firmly . 
`` Why ? '' 
smiled the prosecutor irritably . 
`` What is there disgraceful , to your thinking , in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably , if you prefer , ` disgracefully , ' appropriated ? 
Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it . 
And by the way , why did you do that - why did you set apart that half , for what purpose , for what object did you do it ? 
Can you explain that to us ? '' 
`` Oh , gentlemen , the purpose is the whole point ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I put it aside because I was vile , that is , because I was calculating , and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month . ''
