Brother O. was very eloquent . 
In the evening the admission took place . 
The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle . 
It was Boris Drubetskoy who was admitted . 
I nominated him and was the Rhetor . 
A strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber . 
I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to overcome . 
That is why I should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth , but evil thoughts of him did not leave me . 
It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge .
