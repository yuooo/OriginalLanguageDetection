`` Yes , or no ? '' 
`` My desire is never to leave you , Father , never to separate my life from yours . 
I do n't wish to marry , '' she answered positively , glancing at Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes . 
`` Humbug ! 
Nonsense ! 
Humbug , humbug , humbug ! '' 
cried Prince Bolkonski , frowning and taking his daughter 's hand ; he did not kiss her , but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it , and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry . 
Prince Vasili rose . 
`` My dear , I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never , never forget . 
But , my dear , will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart , so kind and generous ?
