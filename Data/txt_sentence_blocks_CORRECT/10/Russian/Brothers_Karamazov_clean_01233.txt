Enough ! 
Let 's drink to life , dear boy , I propose the toast . 
Why am I pleased with myself ? 
I 'm a scoundrel , but I 'm satisfied with myself . 
And yet I 'm tortured by the thought that I 'm a scoundrel , but satisfied with myself . 
I bless the creation . 
I 'm ready to bless God and His creation directly , but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others ... . 
Let us drink to life , dear brother . 
What can be more precious than life ? 
Nothing !
