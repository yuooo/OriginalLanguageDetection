Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with restraint , but his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable . 
In answer to one question , he sketched his brother 's character as that of a man , violent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions , but at the same time honourable , proud and generous , capable of self-sacrifice , if necessary . 
He admitted , however , that , through his passion for Grushenka and his rivalry with his father , his brother had been of late in an intolerable position . 
But he repelled with indignation the suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain , though he recognised that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession with Mitya ; that upon them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father , and that , indifferent as he was to money as a rule , he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury . 
As for the rivalry of the two `` ladies , '' as the prosecutor expressed it - that is , of Grushenka and Katya - he answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one or two questions altogether . 
`` Did your brother tell you , anyway , that he intended to kill your father ? '' 
asked the prosecutor . 
`` You can refuse to answer if you think necessary , '' he added . 
`` He did not tell me so directly , '' answered Alyosha . 
`` How so ?
