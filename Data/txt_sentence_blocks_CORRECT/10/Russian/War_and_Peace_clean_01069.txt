Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management . 
Some domestic serfs Pierre met , in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived , pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond . 
Anton , a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood , helped Pierre out of his carriage , said that the prince was at home , and showed him into a clean little anteroom . 
Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg . 
He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine , and would have gone farther , but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door . 
`` Well , what is it ? '' 
came a sharp , unpleasant voice . 
`` A visitor , '' answered Anton . 
`` Ask him to wait , '' and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back . 
Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew , who came out frowning and looking old .
