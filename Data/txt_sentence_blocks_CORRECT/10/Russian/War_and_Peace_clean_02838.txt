It was still quite dark outside . 
The rain was over , but drops were still falling from the trees . 
Near the watchman 's hut the black shapes of the Cossacks ' shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen . 
Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible , and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red . 
Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep ; here and there , amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by , could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering . 
Petya came out , peered into the darkness , and went up to the wagons . 
Someone was snoring under them , and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats . 
In the dark Petya recognized his own horse , which he called `` Karabakh '' though it was of Ukranian breed , and went up to it . 
`` Well , Karabakh ! 
We 'll do some service tomorrow , '' said he , sniffing its nostrils and kissing it .
