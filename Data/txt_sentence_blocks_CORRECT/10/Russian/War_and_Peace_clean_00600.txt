`` Oh , take those off ... those ... '' she said , pointing to his spectacles . 
Pierre took them off , and his eyes , besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed , had also a frightened and inquiring look . 
He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it , but with a rapid , almost brutal movement of her head , she intercepted his lips and met them with her own . 
Her face struck Pierre , by its altered , unpleasantly excited expression . 
`` It is too late now , it 's done ; besides I love her , '' thought Pierre . 
`` Je vous aime ! '' 
* he said , remembering what has to be said at such moments : but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself . 
* `` I love you . '' 
Six weeks later he was married , and settled in Count Bezukhov 's large , newly furnished Petersburg house , the happy possessor , as people said , of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money . 
Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili in November , 1805 , announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit .
