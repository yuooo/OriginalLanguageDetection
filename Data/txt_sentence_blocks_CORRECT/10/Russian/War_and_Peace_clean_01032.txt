Remember , dear boy , '' and he drew Pierre 's arm downwards , `` it is simply a misunderstanding . 
I expect you feel it so yourself .

Prince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look . 
`` I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair . 
You know she is very gracious to Helene . '' 
Pierre tried several times to speak , but , on one hand , Prince Vasili did not let him and , on the other , Pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law . 
Moreover , the words of the Masonic statutes , `` be kindly and courteous , '' recurred to him . 
He blinked , went red , got up and sat down again , struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life -- to say an unpleasant thing to a man 's face , to say what the other , whoever he might be , did not expect . 
He was so used to submitting to Prince Vasili 's tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now , but he also felt that on what he said now his future depended -- whether he would follow the same old road , or that new path so attractively shown him by the Masons , on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life .
