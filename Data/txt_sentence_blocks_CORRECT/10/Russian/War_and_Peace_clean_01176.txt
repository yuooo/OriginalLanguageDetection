`` If we are ordered to die , we must die . 
If we 're punished , it means that we have deserved it , it 's not for us to judge . 
If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him , it means that that is the right thing to do . 
If once we begin judging and arguing about everything , nothing sacred will be left ! 
That way we shall be saying there is no God -- nothing ! '' 
shouted Nicholas , banging the table -- very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners , but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts . 
`` Our business is to do our duty , to fight and not to think ! 
That 's all ... '' said he . 
`` And to drink , '' said one of the officers , not wishing to quarrel . 
`` Yes , and to drink , '' assented Nicholas .
