Here as at Tarutino they went after plunder , leaving the men . 
Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape . 
When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself in the midst of his army , it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest , familiar road . 
Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint , not feeling his former agility and boldness , and under the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued orders -- as the historians tell us -- to retreat by the Smolensk road . 
That Napoleon agreed with Mouton , and that the army retreated , does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat , but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk -LRB- that is , the Smolensk -RRB- road acted simultaneously on him also . 
A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion . 
To be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles . 
One must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move . 
The promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow , during their retreat it was their native land . 
But that native land was too far off , and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself : `` Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and spend the night , '' and during the first day 's journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires .
