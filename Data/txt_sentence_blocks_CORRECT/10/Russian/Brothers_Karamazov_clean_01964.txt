`` Well , '' and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation , struck by Smerdyakov 's last argument . 
`` I do n't suspect you at all , and I think it 's absurd , indeed , to suspect you . 
On the contrary , I am grateful to you for setting my mind at rest . 
Now I am going , but I 'll come again . 
Meanwhile , good-bye . 
Get well . 
Is there anything you want ? '' 
`` I am very thankful for everything . 
Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me , and provides me anything I want , according to her kindness . 
Good people visit me every day . ''
