`` Now , remember , '' said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at parting , `` if you have been lying I 'll have you hanged like a dog ; but if it 's true you shall have a hundred gold pieces ! '' 
Without replying , the sergeant , with a resolute air , mounted and rode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled . 
They disappeared into the forest , and Count Orlov-Denisov , having seen Grekov off , returned , shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility , and began looking at the enemy camp , now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires . 
Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right . 
He looked in that direction , but though the columns would have been visible quite far off , they were not to be seen . 
It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French camp , and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this . 
`` Oh , it is really too late , '' said Count Orlov , looking at the camp . 
As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes , it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor , that he had lied , and that the whole Russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments , which he would lead away heaven only knew where . 
How could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops ! 
`` I am sure that rascal was lying , '' said the count .
