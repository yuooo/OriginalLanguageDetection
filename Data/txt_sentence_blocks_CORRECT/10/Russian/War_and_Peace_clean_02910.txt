A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them ; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other 's presence . 
Sometimes they were silent for hours ; sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning . 
They spoke most of what was long past . 
Princess Mary spoke of her childhood , of her mother , her father , and her daydreams ; and Natasha , who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion , submission , and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice , now feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection , learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her . 
She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life , for she was accustomed to seek other joys , but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues . 
For Princess Mary , listening to Natasha 's tales of childhood and early youth , there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life : belief in life and its enjoyment . 
Just as before , they never mentioned him so as not to lower -LRB- as they thought -RRB- their exalted feelings by words ; but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it . 
Natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health , and this pleased her . 
But sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness , weakness , and loss of good looks , and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully , surprised at its thinness , and in the morning noticed her drawn and , as it seemed to her , piteous face in her glass . 
It seemed to her that things must be so , and yet it was dreadfully sad .
