`` How has his whole illness gone ? 
Is it long since he grew worse ? 
When did this happen ? '' 
Princess Mary inquired . 
Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered , but at Troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene . 
That danger had also passed . 
When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester -LRB- Natasha knew all about such things as festering -RRB- and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course . 
Then fever set in , but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious . 
`` But two days ago this suddenly happened , '' said Natasha , struggling with her sobs . 
`` I do n't know why , but you will see what he is like . ''
