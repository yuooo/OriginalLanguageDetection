`` Yes , my dear Monsieur Pierre , I owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac ... . 
You see , I have bullets enough in my body already . 
Here is one I got at Wagram '' -LRB- he touched his side -RRB- `` and a second at Smolensk '' -- he showed a scar on his cheek -- `` and this leg which as you see does not want to march , I got that on the seventh at the great battle of la Moskowa . 
Sacre Dieu ! 
It was splendid ! 
That deluge of fire was worth seeing . 
It was a tough job you set us there , my word ! 
You may be proud of it ! 
And on my honor , in spite of the cough I caught there , I should be ready to begin again . 
I pity those who did not see it . ''
