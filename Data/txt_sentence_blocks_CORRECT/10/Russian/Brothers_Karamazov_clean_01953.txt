`` No , I have n't yet , but I certainly shall . 
You must explain a great deal to me , my man ; and let me tell you , I am not going to let you play with me ! '' 
`` Why should I play with you , when I put my whole trust in you , as in God Almighty ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with the same composure , only for a moment closing his eyes . 
`` In the first place , '' began Ivan , `` I know that epileptic fits ca n't be told beforehand . 
I 've inquired ; do n't try and take me in . 
You ca n't foretell the day and the hour . 
How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand , and about the cellar , too ? 
How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit , if you did n't sham a fit on purpose ? '' 
`` I had to go to the cellar anyway , several times a day , indeed , '' Smerdyakov drawled deliberately .
