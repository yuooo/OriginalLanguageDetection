`` It 's no use your going to the commander in chief . 
He would say a lot of pleasant things , ask you to dinner '' -LRB- `` That would not be bad as regards the unwritten code , '' thought Boris -RRB- , `` but nothing more would come of it . 
There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants ! 
But this is what we 'll do : I have a good friend , an adjutant general and an excellent fellow , Prince Dolgorukov ; and though you may not know it , the fact is that now Kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing . 
Everything is now centered round the Emperor . 
So we will go to Dolgorukov ; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you . 
We shall see whether he can not attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun . '' 
Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success . 
Under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another , which from pride he would never accept for himself , he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him . 
He very readily took up Boris ' cause and went with him to Dolgorukov .
