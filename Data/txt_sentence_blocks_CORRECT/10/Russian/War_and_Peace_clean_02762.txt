He did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad . 
That did not interest him . 
He regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else . 
There was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well , but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it , but must only attend to one 's own work . 
And he did his work , giving his whole strength to the task . 
Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn , like Dokhturov , seems to have been included merely for propriety 's sake in the list of the so-called heroes of 1812 -- the Barclays , Raevskis , Ermolovs , Platovs , and Miloradoviches . 
Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information , and like Dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult . 
Since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open , giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up . 
In battle he was always under fire , so that Kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front , and like Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that , without clatter or noise , constitute the most essential part of the machine . 
Coming out of the hut into the damp , dark night Konovnitsyn frowned - partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him , of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news , especially Bennigsen , who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers drawn with Kutuzov ; and how they would make suggestions , quarrel , issue orders , and rescind them .
