I am not a bit afraid of that - it 's something else I am afraid of now : that that new man may leave me . 
Even there , in the mines , underground , I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side , and I may make friends with him , for even there one may live and love and suffer . 
One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict , one may wait upon him for years , and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul , a feeling , suffering creature ; one may bring forth an angel , create a hero ! 
There are so many of them , hundreds of them , and we are all to blame for them . 
Why was it I dreamed of that ` babe ' at such a moment ? 
` Why is the babe so poor ? ' 
That was a sign to me at that moment . 
It 's for the babe I 'm going . 
Because we are all responsible for all . 
For all the ` babes , ' for there are big children as well as little children All are ` babes . '
