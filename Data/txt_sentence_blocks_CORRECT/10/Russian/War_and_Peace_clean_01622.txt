Natasha , I do n't believe you , you 're joking ! 
In three days to forget everything and so ... '' `` Three days ? '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It seems to me I 've loved him a hundred years . 
It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before . 
You ca n't understand it ... . 
Sonya , wait a bit , sit here , '' and Natasha embraced and kissed her . 
`` I had heard that it happens like this , and you must have heard it too , but it 's only now that I feel such love . 
It 's not the same as before . 
As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave , and that I could not help loving him .
