Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important . 
It did not now occur to him to think of Russia , or the war , or politics , or Napoleon . 
It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his , and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so . 
`` Russia and summer weather are not bound together , '' he thought , repeating words of Karataev 's which he found strangely consoling . 
His intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous . 
His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing . 
What concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred ? 
What did it matter to anybody , and especially to him , whether or not they found out that their prisoner 's name was Count Bezukhov ? 
He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with him , though he understood Prince Andrew 's thoughts somewhat differently . 
Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative , but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied .
