Boris , hearing a strange voice in the anteroom , came out to meet him . 
An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostov . 
`` Ah , it 's you ? 
Very glad , very glad to see you , '' he said , however , coming toward him with a smile . 
But Rostov had noticed his first impulse . 
`` I 've come at a bad time I think . 
I should not have come , but I have business , '' he said coldly . 
`` No , I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment . 
Dans un moment je suis a vous , '' * he said , answering someone who called him . 
* `` In a minute I shall be at your disposal . ''
