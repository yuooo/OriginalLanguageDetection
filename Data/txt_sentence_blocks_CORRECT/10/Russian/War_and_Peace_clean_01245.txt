Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had had not seen the Rostovs . 
He had been in Moscow several times , and had passed near Otradnoe , but had never been to see them . 
Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he not wish to see her , and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him . 
`` Nowadays old friends are not remembered , '' the countess would say when Boris was mentioned . 
Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently , seemed to hold herself with particular dignity , and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered . 
When the Rostovs came to Petersburg Boris called on them . 
He drove to their house in some agitation . 
The memory of Natasha was his most poetic recollection . 
But he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and Natasha could not be binding either on her or on him . 
He had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezukhova , a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed , and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in Petersburg , plans which might very easily be realized .
