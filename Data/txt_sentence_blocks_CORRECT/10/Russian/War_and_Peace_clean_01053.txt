Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity , and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms , he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely Russian . 
Bilibin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him , and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army . 
The letter was old , having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau . 
`` Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz , '' wrote Bilibin , `` as you know , my dear prince , I never leave headquarters . 
I have certainly acquired a taste for war , and it is just as well for me ; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible . 
`` I begin ab ovo . 
` The enemy of the human race , ' as you know , attacks the Prussians . 
The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years . 
We take up their cause , but it turns out that ` the enemy of the human race ' pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun , and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam . '' ' 
I most ardently desire , ' writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte , ` that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself , and in so far as circumstances allowed , I have hastened to take all steps to that end .
