It was not what he had read that vexed him , but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him . 
He shut his eyes , rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read , and listened to what was passing in the nursery . 
Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door . 
He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter . 
He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it . 
Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot . 
`` My dear , '' he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him . 
As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety , he was seized by an unreasoning panic -- it occurred to him that the child was dead . 
All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror . 
`` All is over , '' he thought , and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead .
