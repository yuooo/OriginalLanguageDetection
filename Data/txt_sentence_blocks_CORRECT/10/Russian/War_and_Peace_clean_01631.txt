Natasha , how glad I am you 're not angry with me ! 
Tell me everything -- the whole truth . 
What did he say ? '' 
Natasha became thoughtful . 
`` Oh , Sonya , if you knew him as I do ! 
He said ... He asked me what I had promised Bolkonski . 
He was glad I was free to refuse him . '' 
Sonya sighed sorrowfully . 
`` But you have n't refused Bolkonski ? '' 
said she .
