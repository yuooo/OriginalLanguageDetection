Mitya confirmed it , saying that he had been pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast , just below the neck , and that that was , of course , the disgrace , `` A disgrace I can not deny , the most shameful act of my whole life , '' cried Mitya . 
`` I might have repaid it and did n't repay it . 
I preferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back . 
And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I should n't give it back ! 
You are right , Alyosha ! 
Thanks , Alyosha ! '' 
So Alyosha 's cross-examination ended . 
What was important and striking about it was that one fact at least had been found , and even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence , a mere hint at evidence , it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were `` his own . '' 
Alyosha was glad . 
With a flushed face he moved away to the seat assigned to him .
