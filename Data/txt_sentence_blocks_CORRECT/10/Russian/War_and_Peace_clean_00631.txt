`` Now the fun begins , '' thought Anatole , sitting down with a smile beside the old prince . 
`` Well , my dear boy , I hear you 've been educated abroad , not taught to read and write by the deacon , like your father and me . 
Now tell me , my dear boy , are you serving in the Horse Guards ? '' 
asked the old man , scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently . 
`` No , I have been transferred to the line , '' said Anatole , hardly able to restrain his laughter . 
`` Ah ! 
That 's a good thing . 
So , my dear boy , you wish to serve the Tsar and the country ? 
It is wartime . 
Such a fine fellow must serve .
