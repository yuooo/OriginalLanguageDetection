`` Mamma , you 'll be the death of me . 
Your Herzenstube will come and say that he can make nothing of it ! 
Water , water ! 
Mamma , for goodness ' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia , she is such a slowcoach and never can come quickly ! 
Make haste , mamma , or I shall die . '' 
`` Why , it 's nothing much , '' cried Alyosha , frightened at this alarm . 
Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it . 
`` Some lint , mamma , for mercy 's sake , bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds , what 's it called ? 
We 've got some . 
You know where the bottle is , mamma ; it 's in your bedroom in the right-hand cupboard , there 's a big bottle of it there with the lint . ''
