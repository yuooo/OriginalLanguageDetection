Ivan cried again . 
`` No , you are not a fool , you are far cleverer than I thought ... '' He got up , obviously intending to walk across the room . 
He was in terrible distress . 
But as the table blocked his way , and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall , he only turned round where he stood and sat down again . 
Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him , as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before . 
`` Listen , you miserable , contemptible creature ! 
Do n't you understand that if I have n't killed you , it 's simply because I am keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial . 
God sees , '' Ivan raised his hand , `` perhaps I , too , was guilty ; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father 's ... death , but I swear I was not as guilty as you think , and perhaps I did n't urge you on at all . 
No , no , I did n't urge you on ! 
But no matter , I will give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial .
