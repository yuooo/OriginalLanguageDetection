Nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them . 
He could already see how these men , who looked so small at the foot of the hill , jostled and overtook one another , waving their arms and their sabers in the air . 
Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt . 
He felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now , the latter could not withstand them , but if a charge was to be made it must be done now , at that very moment , or it would be too late . 
He looked around . 
A captain , standing beside him , was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them . 
`` Andrew Sevastyanych ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` You know , we could crush them ... '' `` A fine thing too ! '' 
replied the captain , `` and really ... '' Rostov , without waiting to hear him out , touched his horse , galloped to the front of his squadron , and before he had time to finish giving the word of command , the whole squadron , sharing his feeling , was following him .
