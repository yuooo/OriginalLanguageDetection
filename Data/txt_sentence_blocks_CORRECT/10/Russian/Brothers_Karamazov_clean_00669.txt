`` Let us , Lise ; I am ready . 
Though I am not altogether ready in myself . 
I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I do n't see things . 
It 's different with you . '' 
`` Ah , I do n't believe it ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , how happy I am ! '' 
`` I am so glad you say so , Lise . '' 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , you are wonderfully good , but you are sometimes sort of formal ... . 
And yet you are not a bit formal really . 
Go to the door , open it gently , and see whether mamma is listening , '' said Lise , in a nervous , hurried whisper .
