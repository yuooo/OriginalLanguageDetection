Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the prince 's indisposition . 
Natasha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence , and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say , the greater grew their antipathy to one another . 
When the count returned , Natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened to get away : at that moment she hated the stiff , elderly princess , who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew . 
`` I could n't begin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman , '' thought Natasha . 
The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary . 
She knew what she ought to have said to Natasha , but she had been unable to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way , and because , without knowing why , she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage . 
When the count was already leaving the room , Princess Mary went up hurriedly to Natasha , took her by the hand , and said with a deep sigh : `` Wait , I must ... '' Natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why . 
`` Dear Natalie , '' said Princess Mary , `` I want you to know that I am glad my brother has found happiness ... '' She paused , feeling that she was not telling the truth . 
Natasha noticed this and guessed its reason . 
`` I think , Princess , it is not convenient to speak of that now , '' she said with external dignity and coldness , though she felt the tears choking her .
