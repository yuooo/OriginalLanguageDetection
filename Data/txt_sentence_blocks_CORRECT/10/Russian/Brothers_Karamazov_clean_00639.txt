` Yes , Ilusha , ' I said , ` it is n't a very nice town . ' 
` Father , let us move into another town , a nice one , ' he said , ` where people do n't know about us . ' 
` We will move , we will , Ilusha , ' said I , ` only I must save up for it . ' 
I was glad to be able to turn his mind from painful thoughts , and we began to dream of how we would move to another town , how we would buy a horse and cart . 
` We will put mamma and your sisters inside , we will cover them up and we 'll walk , you shall have a lift now and then , and I 'll walk beside , for we must take care of our horse , we ca n't all ride . 
That 's how we 'll go . ' 
He was enchanted at that , most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving him . 
For of course a Russian boy is born among horses . 
We chattered a long while . 
Thank God , I thought , I have diverted his mind and comforted him .
