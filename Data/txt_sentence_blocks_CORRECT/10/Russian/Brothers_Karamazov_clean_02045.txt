The snowstorm was still raging . 
He walked the first few steps boldly , but suddenly began staggering . 
`` It 's something physical , '' he thought with a grin . 
Something like joy was springing up in his heart . 
He was conscious of unbounded resolution ; he would make an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late . 
His determination was taken , `` and now it will not be changed , '' he thought with relief . 
At that moment he stumbled against something and almost fell down . 
Stopping short , he made out at his feet the peasant he had knocked down , still lying senseless and motionless . 
The snow had almost covered his face . 
Ivan seized him and lifted him in his arms .
