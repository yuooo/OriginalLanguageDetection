Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon , they expected him from every side , and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other 's proposals . 
Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory . 
But besides this feeling of respect , Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew . 
From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor , but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel 's own expressions , it was clear that the others knew , and Pfuel himself felt , that his fall was at hand . 
And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable , with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind . 
Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt , he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him . 
The discussions continued a long time , and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes , culminating in shouts and personalities , and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said . 
Prince Andrew , listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises , plans , refutations , and shouts , felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying . 
A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities -- the idea that there is not and can not be any science of war , and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius -- now appeared to him an obvious truth . 
`` What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and can not be defined , especially when the strength of the acting forces can not be ascertained ?
