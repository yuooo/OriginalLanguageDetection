`` Why are you silent ? '' 
`` What do I think about it ? 
I am listening to you . 
It 's all very well ... . 
You say : join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life , the destiny of man , and the laws which govern the world . 
But who are we ? 
Men . 
How is it you know everything ? 
Why do I alone not see what you see ? 
You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth , but I do n't see it . ''
