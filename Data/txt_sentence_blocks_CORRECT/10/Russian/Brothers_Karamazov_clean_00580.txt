`` Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow - perhaps to-morrow - and to leave you for a long time - and , unluckily , it 's unavoidable , '' Ivan said suddenly . 
`` To-morrow - to Moscow ! '' 
her face was suddenly contorted ; `` but - but , dear me , how fortunate ! '' 
she cried in a voice suddenly changed . 
In one instant there was no trace left of her tears . 
She underwent an instantaneous transformation , which amazed Alyosha . 
Instead of a poor , insulted girl , weeping in a sort of `` laceration , '' he saw a woman completely self-possessed and even exceedingly pleased , as though something agreeable had just happened . 
`` Oh , not fortunate that I am losing you , of course not , '' she collected herself suddenly , with a charming society smile . 
`` Such a friend as you are could not suppose that . 
I am only too unhappy at losing you . ''
