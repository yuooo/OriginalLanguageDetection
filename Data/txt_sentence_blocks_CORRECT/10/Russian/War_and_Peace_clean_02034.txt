When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears , and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her : did she love him ? 
On the rest of the way to Moscow , though the princess ' position was not a cheerful one , Dunyasha , who went with her in the carriage , more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow . 
`` Well , supposing I do love him ? '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her , she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if , without ever speaking of it to anyone , she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life . 
Sometimes when she recalled his looks , his sympathy , and his words , happiness did not appear impossible to her . 
It was at those moments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window . 
`` Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo , and at that very moment ? '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
`` And that caused his sister to refuse my brother ? ''
