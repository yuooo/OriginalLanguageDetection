* `` Moscow , the Asiatic capital of this great empire , the sacred city of Alexander 's people , Moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Napoleon . 
`` One of Platov 's Cossacks says that Platov 's corps is joining up with the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief . 
He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow . '' 
Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him . 
He wished to talk to him himself . 
Several adjutants galloped off , and an hour later , Lavrushka , the serf Denisov had handed over to Rostov , rode up to Napoleon in an orderly 's jacket and on a French cavalry saddle , with a merry , and tipsy face . 
Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him . 
`` You are a Cossack ? ''
