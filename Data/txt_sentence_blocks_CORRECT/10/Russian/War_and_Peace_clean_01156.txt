Rostov almost shouted , not looking Boris in the face . 
Boris smiled . 
`` On the contrary , I will do what I can . 
Only I thought ... '' At that moment Zhilinski 's voice was heard calling Boris . 
`` Well then , go , go , go ... '' said Rostov , and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room , he walked up and down for a long time , hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room . 
Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on Denisov 's behalf . 
He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so , and Boris , even had he wished to , could not have done so on the following day . 
On that day , June 27 , the preliminaries of peace were signed . 
The Emperors exchanged decorations : Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree , and a dinner had been arranged for the evening , given by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion . 
The Emperors were to be present at that banquet .
