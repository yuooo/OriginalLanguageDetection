In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman , the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife , a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate , good-natured fellow . 
But a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in Pierre 's soul , revealing much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys . 
Pierre went on with his diary , and this is what he wrote in it during that time : 24th November Got up at eight , read the Scriptures , then went to my duties .

Returned home for dinner and dined alone -- the countess had many visitors I do not like . 
I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers . 
In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about B. , and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it . 
I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind . 
Great God , help me to walk in Thy paths , -LRB- 1 -RRB- to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation , -LRB- 2 -RRB- to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion , -LRB- 3 -RRB- to withdraw from worldliness , but not avoid -LRB- a -RRB- the service of the state , -LRB- b -RRB- family duties , -LRB- c -RRB- relations with my friends , and the management of my affairs . 
27th November I got up late .
