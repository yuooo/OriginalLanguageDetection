It was the same this time . 
After dinner he walked into the middle of the room , with a paper in his hand - a formal declaration to the chief of his department who was present . 
This declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly . 
It contained a full account of the crime , in every detail . 
`` I cut myself off from men as a monster . 
God has visited me , '' he said in conclusion . 
`` I want to suffer for my sin ! '' 
Then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been keeping for fourteen years , that he thought would prove his crime , the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert suspicion , a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her betrothed in the locket , her notebook and two letters ; one from her betrothed , telling her that he would soon be with her , and her unfinished answer left on the table to be sent off next day . 
He carried off these two letters - what for ? 
Why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of destroying them as evidence against him ?
