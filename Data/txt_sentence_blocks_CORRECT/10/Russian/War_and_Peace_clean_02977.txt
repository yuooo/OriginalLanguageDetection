`` Yes , sir , '' said the man . 
`` Please step into the portrait gallery . '' 
A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles , who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment . 
In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black .

The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand . 
`` Yes , '' she said , looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand , `` so this is how we meet again . 
He spoke of you even at the very last , '' she went on , turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant . 
`` I was so glad to hear of your safety .
