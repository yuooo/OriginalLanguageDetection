The story told about him at Count Rostov 's was true . 
Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear . 
He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father 's house . 
Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father - who were never favorably disposed toward him -- would have used it to turn the count against him , he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father 's part of the house . 
Entering the drawing room , where the princesses spent most of their time , he greeted the ladies , two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud . 
It was the eldest who was reading -- the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna . 
The two younger ones were embroidering : both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier . 
Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper . 
The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes ; the second assumed precisely the same expression ; while the youngest , the one with the mole , who was of a cheerful and lively disposition , bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw . 
She drew her wool down through the canvas and , scarcely able to refrain from laughing , stooped as if trying to make out the pattern .
