Bilibin was a man of thirty-five , a bachelor , and of the same circle as Prince Andrew . 
They had known each other previously in Petersburg , but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutuzov . 
Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession , so to an even greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career . 
He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat , as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen , had been in Paris and Copenhagen , and now held a rather important post in Vienna . 
Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him . 
He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities , avoid doing certain things , and speak French . 
He was one of those , who , liking work , knew how to do it , and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table . 
He worked well whatever the import of his work . 
It was not the question `` What for ? ''
