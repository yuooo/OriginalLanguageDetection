`` To be sure , I 'll stay with them , we are Christians , too . '' 
The old woman wept as she said it . 
They had not far to carry the coffin to the church , not more than three hundred paces . 
It was a still , clear day , with a slight frost . 
The church bells were still ringing . 
Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the coffin , in his short old summer overcoat , with his head bare and his soft , old , wide-brimmed hat in his hand . 
He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety . 
At one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and only hindered the bearers , at another he ran alongside and tried to find a place for himself there . 
A flower fell on the snow and he rushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the loss of that flower . 
`` And the crust of bread , we 've forgotten the crust ! ''
