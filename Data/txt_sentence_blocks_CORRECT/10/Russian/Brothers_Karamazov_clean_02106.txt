What 's the time ? '' 
`` Nearly twelve '' `` No , no , no ! '' 
Ivan cried suddenly . 
`` It was not a dream . 
He was here ; he was sitting here , on that sofa . 
When you knocked at the window , I threw a glass at him ... this one . 
Wait a minute . 
I was asleep last time , but this dream was not a dream . 
It has happened before . 
I have dreams now , Alyosha ... yet they are not dreams , but reality .
