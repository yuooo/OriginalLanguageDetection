He was the first to see him come in . 
Krassotkin 's entrance made a general sensation ; the boys moved away and stood on each side of the bed , so that he could get a full view of Ilusha . 
The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya . 
`` Please come in ... you are welcome ! '' 
he said hurriedly . 
`` Ilusha , Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you ! 
But Krassotkin , shaking hands with him hurriedly , instantly showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society . 
He turned first to the captain 's wife sitting in her armchair , who was very ill-humoured at the moment , and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha 's bed and did not let her see the new puppy . 
With the greatest courtesy he made her a bow , scraping his foot , and turning to Nina , he made her , as the only other lady present , a similar bow . 
This polite behaviour made an extremely favourable impression on the deranged lady .
