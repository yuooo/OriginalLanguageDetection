The doctor entered . 
Prince Andrew went out and , meeting Princess Mary , again joined her . 
They began talking in whispers , but their talk broke off at every moment . 
They waited and listened . 
`` Go , dear , '' said Princess Mary .

A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw Prince Andrew . 
He covered his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes . 
Piteous , helpless , animal moans came through the door .
