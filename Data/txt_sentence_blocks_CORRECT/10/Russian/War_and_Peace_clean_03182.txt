People ceased to kill one another , and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power , resistance to Europe , and so on . 
Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men , and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France , the baseness of England , and so on . 
History shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory , as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights , and the killing of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England . 
But these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day . 
These justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility . 
These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front : they clear men 's moral responsibilities from their path . 
Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event . 
How is it that millions of men commit collective crimes -- make war , commit murder , and so on ? 
With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe can any event that is not prescribed , decreed , or ordered by monarchs , ministers , parliaments , or newspapers be imagined ? 
Is there any collective action which can not find its justification in political unity , in patriotism , in the balance of power , or in civilization ?
