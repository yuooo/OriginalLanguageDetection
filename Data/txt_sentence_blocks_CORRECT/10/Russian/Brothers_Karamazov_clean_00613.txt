I asked him what I had done to him . 
And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly , I do n't know why . '' 
`` I 'll thrash him , sir , at once - this minute ! '' 
The captain jumped up from his seat . 
`` But I am not complaining at all , I am simply telling you ... . 
I do n't want him to be thrashed . 
Besides , he seems to be ill . '' 
`` And do you suppose I 'd thrash him ? 
That I 'd take my Ilusha and thrash him before you for your satisfaction ? 
Would you like it done at once , sir ? ''
