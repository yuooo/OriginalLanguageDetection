`` Would you like three thousand ? 
Take it and go your way . '' 
The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya , with a searching look . 
`` Three thousand , panie ? '' 
He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky . 
`` Three , panovie , three ! 
Listen , panie , I see you 're a sensible man . 
Take three thousand and go to the devil , and Vrublevsky with you d'you hear ? 
But , at once , this very minute , and for ever . 
You understand that , panie , for ever .
