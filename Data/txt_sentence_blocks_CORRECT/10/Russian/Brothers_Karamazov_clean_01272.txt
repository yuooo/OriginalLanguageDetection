And he pulled out his roll of notes , and held them up before the innkeeper 's nose . 
Now , listen and remember . 
In an hour 's time the wine will arrive , savouries , pies , and sweets - bring them all up at once . 
That box Andrey has got is to be brought up at once , too . 
Open it , and hand champagne immediately . 
And the girls , we must have the girls , Marya especially . '' 
He turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols . 
`` Here , Andrey , let 's settle . 
Here 's fifteen roubles for the drive , and fifty for vodka ... for your readiness , for your love ... . 
Remember Karamazov ! ''
