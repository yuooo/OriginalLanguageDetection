Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections . 
Yet , though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles , Dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them , including Anatole himself , respected him more than they did Anatole . 
Dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won . 
However much he drank , he never lost his clearheadedness . 
Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg . 
The bottle of rum was brought . 
The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen , who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around . 
Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window . 
He wanted to smash something . 
Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame , but could not move it .
