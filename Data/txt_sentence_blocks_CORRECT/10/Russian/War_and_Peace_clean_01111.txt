Very glad ! 
Kiss me , '' he said , having learned who the young stranger was . 
The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre . 
Before supper , Prince Andrew , coming back to his father 's study , found him disputing hotly with his visitor . 
Pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars . 
The old prince disputed it chaffingly , but without getting angry . 
`` Drain the blood from men 's veins and put in water instead , then there will be no more war ! 
Old women 's nonsense -- old women 's nonsense ! '' 
he repeated , but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder , and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew , evidently not wishing to join in the conversation , was looking over the papers his father had brought from town . 
The old prince went up to him and began to talk business .
