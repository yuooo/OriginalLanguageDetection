`` It 's all this mania for opposition , '' he went on . 
`` And who for ? 
It is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites , '' Prince Vasili continued , forgetting for a moment that though at Helene 's one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm , at Anna Pavlovna 's one had to be ecstatic about it . 
But he retrieved his mistake at once . 
`` Now , is it suitable that Count Kutuzov , the oldest general in Russia , should preside at that tribunal ? 
He will get nothing for his pains ! 
How could they make a man commander in chief who can not mount a horse , who drops asleep at a council , and has the very worst morals ! 
A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest ! 
I do n't speak of his capacity as a general , but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit , blind old man , positively blind ? 
A fine idea to have a blind general !
