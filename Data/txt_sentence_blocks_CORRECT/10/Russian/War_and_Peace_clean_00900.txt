Because I like his company ? 
If you were cleverer and more agreeable , I should prefer yours . '' 
`` Do n't speak to me ... I beg you , '' muttered Pierre hoarsely . 
`` Why should n't I speak ? 
I can speak as I like , and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers -LRB- des amants -RRB- , but I have not done so , '' said she . 
Pierre wished to say something , looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she did not understand , and lay down again . 
He was suffering physically at that moment , there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe . 
He knew that he must do something to put an end to this suffering , but what he wanted to do was too terrible .
