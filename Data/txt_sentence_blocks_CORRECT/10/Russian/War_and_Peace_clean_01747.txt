`` On the contrary , Your Majesty , '' said Balashev , hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty , `` the troops are burning with eagerness ... '' `` I know everything ! '' 
Napoleon interrupted him . 
`` I know everything . 
I know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own .
