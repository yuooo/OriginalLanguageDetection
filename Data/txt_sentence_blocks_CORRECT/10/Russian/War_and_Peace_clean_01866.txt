On all these faces , as on the faces of the crowd Petya had seen in the Square , there was a striking contradiction : the general expectation of a solemn event , and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party , Peter the cook , Zinaida Dmitrievna 's health , and so on . 
Pierre was there too , buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman 's uniform that had become too tight for him . 
He was agitated ; this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class -- les etats generaux -LRB- States-General -RRB- -- evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul : thoughts of the Contrat social and the French Revolution . 
The words that had struck him in the Emperor 's appeal - that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people -- strengthened this idea . 
And imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near , he strolled about watching and listening to conversations , but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him . 
The Emperor 's manifesto was read , evoking enthusiasm , and then all moved about discussing it . 
Besides the ordinary topics of conversation , Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered , when a ball should be given in the Emperor 's honor , whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces ... and so on ; but as soon as the war was touched on , or what the nobility had been convened for , the talk became undecided and indefinite . 
Then all preferred listening to speaking . 
A middle-aged man , handsome and virile , in the uniform of a retired naval officer , was speaking in one of the rooms , and a small crowd was pressing round him . 
Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened .
