She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying , and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else . 
But she had to force herself to attend , for what he was saying did not interest her at all . 
She looked at him and did not think , but felt , about something different . 
She felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood , and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness . 
Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband 's plans , thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind . 
She thought of her nephew . 
Her husband 's account of the boy 's agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly , and various traits of his gentle , sensitive character recurred to her mind ; and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children . 
She did not compare them with him , but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him , and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas . 
Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages , but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible - in this life to love her husband , her children , little Nicholas , and all her neighbors , as Christ loved mankind . 
Countess Mary 's soul always strove toward the infinite , the eternal , and the absolute , and could therefore never be at peace .
