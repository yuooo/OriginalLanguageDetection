More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention , but Pierre did not hear him . 
`` Is the cabman to be discharged , your honor ? '' 
`` Oh yes ! '' 
said Pierre , rousing himself and rising hurriedly . 
`` Look here , '' he added , taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist , shining , and ecstatic eyes , `` I say , do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow ? '' 
`` We heard so , '' replied the man . 
`` I beg you not to tell anyone who I am , and to do what I ask you . '' 
`` Yes , your excellency , '' replied Gerasim . 
`` Will you have something to eat ? '' 
`` No , but I want something else .
