`` You , who have suffered so from the French , do not even feel animosity toward them . '' 
Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing . 
During the last days of Pierre 's stay in Orel his old Masonic acquaintance Count Willarski , who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807 , came to see him . 
Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a large estate in Orel province , and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town . 
Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel , Willarski , though they had never been intimate , came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another . 
Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and , as he supposed , of similar interests . 
But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much behind the times , and had sunk , as he expressed it to himself , into apathy and egotism . 
`` You are letting yourself go , my dear fellow , '' he said . 
But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with Pierre , and came to see him every day . 
To Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski , it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before .
