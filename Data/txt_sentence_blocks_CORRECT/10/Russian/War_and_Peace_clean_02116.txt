Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses . 
When Pierre had left Kutuzov , Dolokhov came up to him and took his hand . 
`` I am very glad to meet you here , Count , '' he said aloud , regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone . 
`` On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive , I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me . 
I beg you to forgive me . '' 
Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile , not knowing what to say to him . 
With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him . 
Boris said a few words to his general , and Count Bennigsen turned to Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line . 
`` It will interest you , '' said he . 
`` Yes , very much , '' replied Pierre .
