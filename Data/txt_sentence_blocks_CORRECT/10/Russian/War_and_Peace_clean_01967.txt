`` My mind , my mind aches ? '' 
questioned Princess Mary . 
He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this , took her hand , and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it . 
`` Always thoughts ... about you ... thoughts ... '' he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before , now that he was sure of being understood . 
Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand , trying to hide her sobs and tears . 
He moved his hand over her hair . 
`` I have been calling you all night ... '' he brought out . 
`` If only I had known ... '' she said through her tears . 
`` I was afraid to come in . '' 
He pressed her hand .
