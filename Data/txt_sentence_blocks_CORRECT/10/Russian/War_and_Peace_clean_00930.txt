`` Let them ! 
I do n't care a straw about anyone but those I love ; but those I love , I love so that I would give my life for them , and the others I 'd throttle if they stood in my way . 
I have an adored , a priceless mother , and two or three friends -- you among them -- and as for the rest I only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful . 
And most of them are harmful , especially the women . 
Yes , dear boy , '' he continued , `` I have met loving , noble , high-minded men , but I have not yet met any women -- countesses or cooks -- who were not venal . 
I have not yet met that divine purity and devotion I look for in women . 
If I found such a one I 'd give my life for her ! 
But those ! 
... '' and he made a gesture of contempt . 
`` And believe me , if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature , who will regenerate , purify , and elevate me .
