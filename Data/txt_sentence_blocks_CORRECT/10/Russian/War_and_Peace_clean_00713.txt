`` There ! 
They are bringing another ! '' 
cried one of the officers , indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks . 
One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the prisoner . 
`` Sell us that horse ! '' 
Denisov called out to the Cossacks . 
`` If you like , your honor ! '' 
The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner . 
The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent . 
He was breathless with agitation , his face was red , and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers , addressing first one , then another .
