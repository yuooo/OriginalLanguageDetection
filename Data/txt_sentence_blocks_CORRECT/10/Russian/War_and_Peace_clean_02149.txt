De Beausset 's hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the Empress , on two chairs directly in front of the entrance . 
But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise . 
Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready . 
He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise , so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to him , listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca , at the other end of Europe , with but one thought -- to be worthy of their Emperor -- and but one fear -- to fail to please him . 
The result of that battle had been deplorable . 
Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier 's account , as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence . 
`` I must make up for that in Moscow , '' said Napoleon . 
`` I 'll see you later , '' he added , and summoned de Beausset , who by that time had prepared the surprise , having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth . 
De Beausset bowed low , with that courtly French bow which only the old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make , and approached him , presenting an envelope . 
Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear .
