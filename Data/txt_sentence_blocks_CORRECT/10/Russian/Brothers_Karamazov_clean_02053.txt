`` Listen , '' Ivan suddenly got up from the table . 
`` I seem to be delirious ... I am delirious , in fact , talk any nonsense you like , I do n't care ! 
You wo n't drive me to fury , as you did last time . 
But I feel somehow ashamed ... I want to walk about the room ... . 
I sometimes do n't see you and do n't even hear your voice as I did last time , but I always guess what you are prating , for it 's I , I myself speaking , not you . 
Only I do n't know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you . 
I 'll wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you 'll vanish into air . '' 
Ivan went into the corner , took a towel , and did as he said , and with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room . 
`` I am so glad you treat me so familiarly , '' the visitor began . 
`` Fool , '' laughed Ivan , `` do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you ?
