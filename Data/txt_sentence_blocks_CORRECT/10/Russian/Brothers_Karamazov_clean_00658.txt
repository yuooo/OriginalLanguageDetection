And you know she is laughing at me every minute . 
But this time she was in earnest She thinks a great deal of your opinion , Alexey Fyodorovitch , and do n't take offence or be wounded by her if you can help it . 
I am never hard upon her , for she 's such a clever little thing . 
Would you believe it ? 
She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood , ` the greatest friend of her childhood ' - just think of that - ` greatest friend ' - and what about me ? 
She has very strong feelings and memories , and , what 's more , she uses these phrases , most unexpected words , which come out all of a sudden when you least expect them . 
She spoke lately about a pine-tree , for instance : there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early childhood . 
Very likely it 's standing there still ; so there 's no need to speak in the past tense . 
Pine-trees are not like people , Alexey Fyodorovitch , they do n't change quickly . 
` Mamma , ' she said , ' I remember this pine tree as in a dream , ' only she said something so original about it that I ca n't repeat it .
