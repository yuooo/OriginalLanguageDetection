Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it . 
He acted as he did when hunting , without reflecting or considering . 
He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder ; he knew they could not withstand an attack -- knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return . 
The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself . 
He touched his horse , gave the word of command , and immediately , hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron , rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons . 
Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop , which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after them . 
The dragoons were now close at hand . 
On seeing the hussars , the foremost began to turn , while those behind began to halt . 
With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf , Rostov gave rein to his Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons ' disordered lines . 
One Uhlan stopped , another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over , and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars .
