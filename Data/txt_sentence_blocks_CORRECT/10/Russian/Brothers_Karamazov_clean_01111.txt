And , indeed , it 's a struggle of three in this business , for it 's fate - that 's a fearful thing , Kuzma Kuzmitch ! 
A tragedy , Kuzma Kuzmitch , a tragedy ! 
And as you 've dropped out long ago , it 's a tug-of-war between two . 
I 'm expressing it awkwardly , perhaps , but I 'm not a literary man . 
You see , I 'm on the one side , and that monster on the other . 
So you must choose . 
It 's either I or the monster . 
It all lies in your hands - . 
the fate of three lives , and the happiness of two ... . 
Excuse me , I 'm making a mess of it , but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that you understand ... and if you do n't understand , I 'm done for ... so you see ! ''
