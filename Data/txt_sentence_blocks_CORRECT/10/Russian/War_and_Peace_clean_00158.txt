`` Send Dmitri to me ! '' 
Dmitri , a man of good family who had been brought up in the count 's house and now managed all his affairs , stepped softly into the room . 
`` This is what I want , my dear fellow , '' said the count to the deferential young man who had entered . 
`` Bring me ... '' he reflected a moment , `` yes , bring me seven hundred rubles , yes ! 
But mind , do n't bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time , but nice clean ones for the countess . '' 
`` Yes , Dmitri , clean ones , please , '' said the countess , sighing deeply . 
`` When would you like them , your excellency ? '' 
asked Dmitri . 
`` Allow me to inform you ... But , do n't be uneasy , '' he added , noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger . 
`` I was forgetting ... Do you wish it brought at once ? ''
