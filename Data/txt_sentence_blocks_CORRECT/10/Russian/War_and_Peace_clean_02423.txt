The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion , the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel , and suddenly the administrator , instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power , becomes an insignificant , useless , feeble man . 
Rostopchin felt this , and it was this which exasperated him . 
The superintendent of police , whom the crowd had stopped , went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed . 
They were both pale , and the superintendent of police , after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received , informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him . 
Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light , luxurious drawing room , went to the balcony door , took hold of the handle , let it go again , and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd . 
The tall lad was standing in front , flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look . 
The blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face . 
A drone of voices was audible through the closed window . 
`` Is my carriage ready ? '' 
asked Rostopchin , stepping back from the window .
