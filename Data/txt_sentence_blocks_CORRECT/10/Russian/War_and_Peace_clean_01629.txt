`` I do n't want anyone , I do n't love anyone but him . 
How dare you say he is dishonorable ? 
Do n't you know that I love him ? '' 
screamed Natasha . 
`` Go away , Sonya ! 
I do n't want to quarrel with you , but go , for God 's sake go ! 
You see how I am suffering ! '' 
Natasha cried angrily , in a voice of despair and repressed irritation . 
Sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room . 
Natasha went to the table and without a moment 's reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning .
