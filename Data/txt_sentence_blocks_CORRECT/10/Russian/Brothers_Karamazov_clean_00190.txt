Alyosha 's face again betrayed strong emotion . 
The corners of his mouth quivered . 
`` What is it again ? '' 
Father Zossima asked , smiling gently . 
`` The worldly may follow the dead with tears , but here we rejoice over the father who is departing . 
We rejoice and pray for him . 
Leave me , I must pray . 
Go , and make haste . 
Be near your brothers . 
And not near one only , but near both . ''
