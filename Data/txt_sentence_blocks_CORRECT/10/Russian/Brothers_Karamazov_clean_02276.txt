` Of that bloodshed I am guilty , but who has killed my father , gentlemen , who has killed him ? 
Who can have killed him , if not I ? '

Do you hear that uttered with such premature haste - ` if not I ' - the animal cunning , the naivete the Karamazov impatience of it ? '

I wanted to kill him , gentlemen , I wanted to kill him , ' he hastens to admit -LRB- he was in a hurry , in a terrible hurry -RRB- , ` but still I am not guilty , it is not I murdered him . '
