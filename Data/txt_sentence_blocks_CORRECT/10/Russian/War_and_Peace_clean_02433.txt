cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise , looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him . 
A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd . 
`` O Lord ! '' 
exclaimed a sorrowful voice . 
But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain , and that cry was fatal . 
The barrier of human feeling , strained to the utmost , that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke . 
The crime had begun and must now be completed . 
The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd . 
Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship , that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks , carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all . 
The dragoon was about to repeat his blow .
