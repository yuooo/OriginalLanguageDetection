But what is there to wonder at , what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us ? 
We are so accustomed to such crimes ! 
That 's what 's so horrible , that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us . 
What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it , and not this or that isolated crime . 
What are the causes of our indifference , our lukewarm attitude to such deeds , to such signs of the times , ominous of an unenviable future ? 
Is it our cynicism , is it the premature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay , in spite of its youth ? 
Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their foundations , or is it , perhaps , a complete lack of such principles among us ? 
I can not answer such questions ; nevertheless they are disturbing , and every citizen not only must , but ought to be harassed by them . 
Our newborn and still timid press has done good service to the public already , for without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press , not merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present reign , but to everyone . 
And what do we read almost daily ?
