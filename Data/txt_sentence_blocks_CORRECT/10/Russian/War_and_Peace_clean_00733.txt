But one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements . 
Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who , with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading , gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait . 
In the middle of one of the longest sentences , he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox , raised his head , and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother , wishing to say something . 
But the Austrian general , continuing to read , frowned angrily and jerked his elbows , as if to say : `` You can tell me your views later , but now be so good as to look at the map and listen . '' 
Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity , turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an explanation , but meeting the latter 's impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox . 
`` A geography lesson ! '' 
he muttered as if to himself , but loud enough to be heard . 
Przebyszewski , with respectful but dignified politeness , held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother , with the air of a man absorbed in attention . 
Dohkturov , a little man , sat opposite Weyrother , with an assiduous and modest mien , and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality . 
He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages .
