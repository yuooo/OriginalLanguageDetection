`` What for ? 
I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life . '' 
`` Do n't be anxious about my nature , '' Kolya interrupted , not without complacency . 
`` But it 's true that I am stupidly sensitive , crudely sensitive . 
You smiled just now , and I fancied you seemed to - '' `` Oh , my smile meant something quite different . 
I 'll tell you why I smiled . 
Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia , on our students and schoolboys of to-day . 
` Show a Russian schoolboy , ' he writes , ' a map of the stars , which he knows nothing about , and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it . ' 
No knowledge and unbounded conceit - that 's what the German meant to say about the Russian schoolboy . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perfectly right , '' Kolya laughed suddenly , `` exactly so !
