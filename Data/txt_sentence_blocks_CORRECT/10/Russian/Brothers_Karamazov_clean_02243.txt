You yourselves heard that young lady 's exclamation , ` It is the plan , the programme of the murder ! ' 
That is how she defined that miserable , drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner . 
And , in fact , from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was premeditated . 
It was written two days before , and so we know now for a fact that , forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible design , the prisoner swore that , if he could not get money next day , he would murder his father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his pillow , as soon as Ivan had left . 
` As soon as Ivan had gone away ' - you hear that ; so he had thought everything out , weighing every circumstance , and he carried it all out just as he had written it . 
The proof of premeditation is conclusive ; the crime must have been committed for the sake of the money , that is stated clearly , that is written and signed . 
The prisoner does not deny his signature . 
`` I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it . 
But that does not diminish the value of the letter , quite the contrary ; he wrote when drunk what he had planned when sober . 
Had he not planned it when sober , he would not have written it when drunk .
