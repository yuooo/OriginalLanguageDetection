This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew , he knew not why . 
He was unpleasantly struck , too , by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in Speranski , and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions . 
He made use of every kind of mental device , except analogy , and passed too boldly , it seemed to Prince Andrew , from one to another . 
Now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers ; now that of a satirist , and laugh ironically at his opponents ; now grow severely logical , or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics .

He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights , pass on to definitions of space , time , and thought , and , having deduced the refutation he needed , would again descend to the level of the original discussion . 
In general the trait of Speranski 's mentality which struck Prince Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason . 
It was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural , namely , that it is after all impossible to express all one thinks ; and that he had never felt the doubt , `` Is not all I think and believe nonsense ? '' 
And it was just this peculiarity of Speranski 's mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew . 
During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for Bonaparte .
