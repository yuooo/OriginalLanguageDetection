`` You go to sleep , but I ca n't , '' said the first voice , coming nearer to the window . 
She was evidently leaning right out , for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard .

`` Sonya ! 
Sonya ! '' 
he again heard the first speaker . 
`` Oh , how can you sleep ? 
Only look how glorious it is !
