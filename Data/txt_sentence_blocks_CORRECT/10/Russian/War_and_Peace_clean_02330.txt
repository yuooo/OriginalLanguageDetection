remarked the major-domo . 
But Natasha would not give in . 
She turned everything out and began quickly repacking , deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all . 
When everything had been taken out of the cases , they recommenced packing , and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected , the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases . 
Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down . 
A few more things might have been taken out , but Natasha insisted on having her own way . 
She packed , repacked , pressed , made the butler 's assistant and Petya -- whom she had drawn into the business of packing -- press on the lid , and made desperate efforts herself . 
`` That 's enough , Natasha , '' said Sonya . 
`` I see you were right , but just take out the top one . '' 
`` I wo n't ! ''
