Among these folk , too , there are good men as well as bad , '' said he , and still speaking , he turned on his knees with a supple movement , got up , coughed , and went off to another part of the shed . 
`` Eh , you rascal ! '' 
Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed . 
`` So you 've come , you rascal ? 
She remembers ... Now , now , that 'll do ! '' 
And the soldier , pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him , returned to his place and sat down . 
In his hands he had something wrapped in a rag . 
`` Here , eat a bit , sir , '' said he , resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes . 
`` We had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand ! '' 
Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him .
