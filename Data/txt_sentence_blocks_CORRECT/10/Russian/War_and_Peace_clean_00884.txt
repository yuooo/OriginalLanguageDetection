he shouted angrily and stepped aside . 
The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks , nearer and nearer to one another , beginning to see one another through the mist . 
They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier . 
Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol , looking intently with his bright , sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist 's face . 
His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile . 
`` So I can fire when I like ! '' 
said Pierre , and at the word `` three , '' he went quickly forward , missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow . 
He held the pistol in his right hand at arm 's length , apparently afraid of shooting himself with it . 
His left hand he held carefully back , because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so .
