`` Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment , '' said Rostopchin . 
`` I am straight from the palace . 
Seeing the position we are in , I think there is little need for discussion .

Millions will pour forth from there '' -- he pointed to the merchants ' hall -- `` but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves ... That is the least we can do ! '' 
A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table . 
The whole consultation passed more than quietly . 
After all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another , `` I agree , '' or for variety , `` I too am of that opinion , '' and so on had even a mournful effect .
