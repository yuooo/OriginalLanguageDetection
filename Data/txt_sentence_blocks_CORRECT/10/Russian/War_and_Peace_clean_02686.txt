The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him ; but whether he was still alive , whether he was strong and merely lying low , the hunter did not know . 
Suddenly the beast was heard to moan . 
The moan of that wounded beast -LRB- the French army -RRB- which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov 's camp with overtures for peace . 
Napoleon , with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right , wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him , though they were meaningless . 
MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV : I am sending one of my adjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you . 
I beg your Highness to credit what he says to you , especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your person . 
This letter having no other object , I pray God , monsieur le Prince Koutouzov , to keep you in His holy and gracious protection ! 
NAPOLEON MOSCOW , OCTOBER 30 , 1812 Kutuzov replied : `` I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort . 
Such is the present spirit of my nation . '' 
But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking .
