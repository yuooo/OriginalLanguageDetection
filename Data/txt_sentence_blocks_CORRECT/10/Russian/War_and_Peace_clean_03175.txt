Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person ? 
On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people . 
That is , power is power : in other words , power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand . 
If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning , then having subjected to criticism the explanation of `` power '' that juridical science gives us , humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence . 
But to understand phenomena man has , besides abstract reasoning , experience by which he verifies his reflections . 
And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon . 
Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power , the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events . 
Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear , by whose will the event seems to have taken place . 
Napoleon III issues a decree and the French go to Mexico . 
The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an army enters Bohemia .
