Half the street was in shadow , the other half brightly lit by the sun . 
Alpatych looked out of the window and went to the door . 
Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was heard , followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling . 
He went out into the street : two men were running past toward the bridge . 
From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town . 
But these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants . 
The town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after four o'clock . 
The people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment . 
At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity . 
Ferapontov 's wife , who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed , became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate , listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people .
