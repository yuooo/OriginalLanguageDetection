The column moved forward without knowing where and unable , from the masses around them , the smoke and the increasing fog , to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going . 
A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship . 
However far he has walked , whatever strange , unknown , and dangerous places he reaches , just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks , masts , and rigging of his ship , so the soldier always has around him the same comrades , the same ranks , the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich , the same company dog Jack , and the same commanders . 
The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing , but on the day of battle -- heaven knows how and whence -- a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army , announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn , and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity . 
On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment , they listen intently , look about , and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them . 
The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead . 
Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes . 
Anywhere , on any side , one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off . 
But the columns advanced for a long time , always in the same fog , descending and ascending hills , avoiding gardens and enclosures , going over new and unknown ground , and nowhere encountering the enemy . 
On the contrary , the soldiers became aware that in front , behind , and on all sides , other Russian columns were moving in the same direction .
