Could the old man have been laughing at me ? '' 
exclaimed Mitya , as he strode towards his lodging . 
He could , of course , imagine nothing but that the advice was practical `` from such a business man '' with an understanding of the business , with an understanding of this Lyagavy -LRB- curious surname ! -RRB- . 
Or - the old man was laughing at him . 
Alas ! 
The second alternative was the correct one . 
Long afterwards , when the catastrophe had happened , old Samsonov himself confessed , laughing , that he had made a fool of the `` captain . '' 
He was a cold , spiteful and sarcastic man , liable to violent antipathies . 
Whether it was the `` captain 's '' excited face , or the foolish conviction of the `` rake and spendthrift , '' that he , Samsonov , could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his scheme , or his jealousy of Grushenka , in whose name this `` scapegrace '' had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man , I ca n't tell . 
But at the instant when Mitya stood before him , feeling his legs grow weak under him , and frantically exclaiming that he was ruined , at that moment the old man looked at him with intense spite , and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him .
