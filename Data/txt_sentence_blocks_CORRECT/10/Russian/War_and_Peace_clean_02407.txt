`` What have you killed a man for , you thief ? '' 
The tall lad , standing in the porch , turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now . 
`` Murderer ! '' 
he shouted suddenly to the publican . 
`` Bind him , lads ! '' 
`` I daresay you would like to bind me ! '' 
shouted the publican , pushing away the men advancing on him , and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground . 
As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance , the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision . 
`` I know the law very well , mates ! 
I 'll take the matter to the captain of police .
