This is how it happened . 
When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his interview with Count Rostopchin , he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him . 
When he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife , the Countess Helene , he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb . 
He felt that everything was now at an end , all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces , that nobody was right or wrong , the future held nothing , and there was no escape from this position . 
Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself , he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair , then rose , went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack , returned flourishing his arms , and took up a book . 
His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute , and that someone from Bazdeev 's widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband 's books , as she herself was leaving for the country .
