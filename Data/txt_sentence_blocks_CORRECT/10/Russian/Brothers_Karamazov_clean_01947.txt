He used violent language , accused Smerdyakov , and was fearfully muddled . 
He talked principally about the three thousand roubles , which he said had been `` stolen '' from him by his father . 
`` The money was mine , it was my money , '' Mitya kept repeating . 
`` Even if I had stolen it , I should have had the right . '' 
He hardly contested the evidence against him , and if he tried to turn a fact to his advantage , it was in an absurd and incoherent way . 
He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or anyone else . 
Quite the contrary , he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him ; he was continually firing up and abusing everyone . 
He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory 's evidence about the open door , and declared that it was `` the devil that opened it . '' 
But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact . 
He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview , telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that `` everything was lawful , '' to suspect and question him .
