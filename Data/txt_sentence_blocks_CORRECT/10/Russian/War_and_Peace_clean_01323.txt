Prince Andrew seemed , and really was , quite a different , quite a new man . 
Where was his spleen , his contempt for life , his disillusionment ? 
Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly ; and to him he told all that was in his soul . 
Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future , said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father 's caprice , and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her , or would do without his consent ; then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange , apart from and independent of himself . 
`` I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of such love , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` It is not at all the same feeling that I knew in the past . 
The whole world is now for me divided into two halves : one half is she , and there all is joy , hope , light : the other half is everything where she is not , and there is all gloom and darkness ... '' `` Darkness and gloom , '' reiterated Pierre : `` yes , yes , I understand that . '' 
`` I can not help loving the light , it is not my fault . 
And I am very happy ! 
You understand me ?
