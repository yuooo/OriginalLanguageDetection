Really I have some , '' Rostov repeated . 
`` No , I tell you . '' 
And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow . 
`` Where have you put it , Wostov ? '' 
`` Under the lower pillow . '' 
`` It 's not there . '' 
Denisov threw both pillows on the floor . 
The purse was not there . 
`` That 's a miwacle . '' 
`` Wait , have n't you dropped it ? ''
