Our court is the best hall in the town - spacious , lofty , and good for sound . 
On the right of the judges , who were on a raised platform , a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury . 
On the left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defence . 
In the middle of the court , near the judges , was a table with the `` material proofs . '' 
On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch 's white silk dressing-gown , stained with blood ; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been committed ; Mitya 's shirt , with a blood-stained sleeve ; his coat , stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put his handkerchief ; the handkerchief itself , stiff with blood and by now quite yellow ; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin 's with a view to suicide , and taken from him on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borrissovitch ; the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for Grushenka , the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied , and many other articles I do n't remember . 
In the body of the hall , at some distance , came the seats for the public . 
But in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence . 
At ten o'clock the three judges arrived - the President , one honorary justice of the peace , and one other . 
The prosecutor , of course , entered immediately after . 
The President was a short , stout , thick-set man of fifty , with a dyspeptic complexion , dark hair turning grey and cut short , and a red ribbon , of what Order I do n't remember .
