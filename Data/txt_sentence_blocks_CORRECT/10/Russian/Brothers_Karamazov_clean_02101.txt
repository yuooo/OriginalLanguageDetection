`` I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall . '' 
On Alyosha 's inquiring whether she had informed the police , she answered that she had told no one , `` but I flew straight to you , I 've run all the way . '' 
She seemed perfectly crazy , Alyosha reported , and was shaking like a leaf . 
When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage , he found Smerdyakov still hanging . 
On the table lay a note : `` I destroy my life of my own will and desire , so as to throw no blame on anyone . '' 
Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told him all about it . 
`` And from him I 've come straight to you , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , looking intently into Ivan 's face . 
He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story , as though struck by something in his expression . 
`` Brother , '' he cried suddenly , `` you must be terribly ill . 
You look and do n't seem to understand what I tell you . ''
