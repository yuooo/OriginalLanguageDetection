`` I get there , '' began Denisov . '' 
` Now then , where 's your chief 's quarters ? ' 
They were pointed out . 
` Please to wait . ' 
` I 've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait . 
Announce me . ' 
Vewy well , so out comes their head chief -- also took it into his head to lecture me : ` It 's wobbewy ! ' 
-- ` Wobbewy , ' I say , ` is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers , but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets ! ' 
` Will you please be silent ? ' 
` Vewy good ! '
