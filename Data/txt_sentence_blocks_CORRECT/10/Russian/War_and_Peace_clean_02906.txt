Petya 's death had torn from her half her life . 
When the news of Petya 's death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty , but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life . 
But the same blow that almost killed the countess , this second blow , restored Natasha to life . 
A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and , strange as it may seem , just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join , physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within . 
Natasha 's wound healed in that way . 
She thought her life was ended , but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life -- love -- was still active within her . 
Love awoke and so did life . 
Prince Andrew 's last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha together ; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another . 
Princess Mary put off her departure , and for three weeks looked after Natasha as if she had been a sick child . 
The last weeks passed in her mother 's bedroom had strained Natasha 's physical strength .
