Do n't be bashful , child . 
I 'm sorry I did n't stay to dinner at the Superior 's and tell the monks about the girls at Mokroe . 
Alyosha , do n't be angry that I offended your Superior this morning . 
I lost my temper . 
If there is a God , if He exists , then , of course , I 'm to blame , and I shall have to answer for it . 
But if there is n't a God at all , what do they deserve , your fathers ? 
It 's not enough to cut their heads off , for they keep back progress . 
Would you believe it , Ivan , that that lacerates my sentiments ? 
No , you do n't believe it as I see from your eyes . 
You believe what people say , that I 'm nothing but a buffoon .
