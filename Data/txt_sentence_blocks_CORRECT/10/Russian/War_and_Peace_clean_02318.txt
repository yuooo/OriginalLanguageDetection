Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet , their cries , and their spontaneous laughter . 
They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh , but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them . 
Petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned -LRB- as everybody told him -RRB- a fine young man , because he was at home , because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days , and chiefly because Natasha , whose lead he always followed , was in high spirits . 
Natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness , and because she was feeling well . 
She was also happy because she had someone to adore her : the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely -- and Petya adored her . 
Above all , they were gay because there was a war near Moscow , there would be fighting at the town gates , arms were being given out , everybody was escaping -- going away somewhere , and in general something extraordinary was happening , and that is always exciting , especially to the young . 
On Saturday , the thirty-first of August , everything in the Rostovs ' house seemed topsy-turvy . 
All the doors were open , all the furniture was being carried out or moved about , and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down . 
There were trunks in the rooms , and hay , wrapping paper , and ropes were scattered about . 
The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors .
