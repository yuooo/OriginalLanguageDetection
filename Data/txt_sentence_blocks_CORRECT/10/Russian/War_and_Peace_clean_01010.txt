`` In that case we can go , '' said Willarski . 
`` My carriage is at your service . '' 
Willarski was silent throughout the drive . 
To Pierre 's inquiries as to what he must do and how he should answer , Willarski only replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to tell the truth . 
Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its headquarters , and having ascended a dark staircase , they entered a small well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a servant . 
From there they passed into another room . 
A man in strange attire appeared at the door . 
Willarski , stepping toward him , said something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before . 
Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard , Willarski bound Pierre 's eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind , catching some hairs painfully in the knot . 
Then he drew his face down , kissed him , and taking him by the hand led him forward .
