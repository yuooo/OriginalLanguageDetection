Pierre had been educated abroad , and this reception at Anna Pavlovna 's was the first he had attended in Russia . 
He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and , like a child in a toyshop , did not know which way to look , afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard . 
Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound . 
At last he came up to Morio . 
Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views , as young people are fond of doing . 
Anna Pavlovna 's reception was in full swing . 
The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides . 
With the exception of the aunt , beside whom sat only one elderly lady , who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society , the whole company had settled into three groups . 
One , chiefly masculine , had formed round the abbe . 
Another , of young people , was grouped round the beautiful Princess Helene , Prince Vasili 's daughter , and the little Princess Bolkonskaya , very pretty and rosy , though rather too plump for her age .
