`` Ah , children , ah , dear friends , do n't be afraid of life ! 
How good life is when one does something good and just ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' the boys repeated enthusiastically . 
`` Karamazov , we love you ! '' 
a voice , probably Kartashov 's , cried impulsively . 
`` We love you , we love you ! '' 
they all caught it up . 
There were tears in the eyes of many of them . 
`` Hurrah for Karamazov ! ''
