That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible , still wet with the night 's rain ; the drooping branches of the birches , also wet , swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side . 
The soldiers ' faces were more and more clearly visible . 
Rostov , always closely followed by Ilyin , rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees . 
When campaigning , Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse . 
A judge of horses and a sportsman , he had lately procured himself a large , fine , mettlesome , Donets horse , dun-colored , with light mane and tail , and when he rode it no one could outgallop him . 
To ride this horse was a pleasure to him , and he thought of the horse , of the morning , of the doctor 's wife , but not once of the impending danger . 
Formerly , when going into action , Rostov had felt afraid ; now he had not the least feeling of fear . 
He was fearless , not because he had grown used to being under fire -LRB- one can not grow used to danger -RRB- , but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger . 
He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him -- the impending danger . 
During the first period of his service , hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice , he had not been able to do this , but with time it had come of itself .
