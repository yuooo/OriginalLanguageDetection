`` To be sure , we all have to die . 
I 'm not against the commune , '' said Dron . 
`` That 's it -- not against it !

As soon as Rostov , followed by Ilyin , Lavrushka , and Alpatych , came up to the crowd , Karp , thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little , walked to the front . 
Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together . 
`` Who is your Elder here ?

shouted Rostov , coming up to the crowd with quick steps .
