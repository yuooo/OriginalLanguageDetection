Natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk , especially by the French , which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries , should not neglect her accomplishments , should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried , and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband . 
Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery , of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part . 
She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive . 
She took no pains with her manners or with of speech , or with her toilet , or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes , or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting . 
She acted in contradiction to all those rules . 
She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband , to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely -- that is , with her whole soul , leaving no corner of it hidden from him . 
She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her , but by something else -- indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul . 
To fluff out her curls , put on fashionable dresses , and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself . 
To adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable -- she did not know -- but she had no time at all for it . 
The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing , to dress , or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things .
