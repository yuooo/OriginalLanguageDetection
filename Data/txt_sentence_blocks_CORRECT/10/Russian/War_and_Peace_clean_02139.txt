Since they are my foes they can not be my friends , whatever may have been said at Tilsit . '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' muttered Pierre , looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew . 
`` I quite agree with you ! '' 
The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved . 
He now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle . 
All he had seen that day , all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing , were lit up for him by a new light . 
He understood that latent heat -LRB- as they say in physics -RRB- of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen , and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly , and as it were lightheartedly . 
`` Not take prisoners , '' Prince Andrew continued : `` That by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel . 
As it is we have played at war -- that 's what 's vile ! 
We play at magnanimity and all that stuff .
