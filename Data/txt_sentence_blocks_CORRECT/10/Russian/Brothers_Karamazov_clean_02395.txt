`` As soon as I arrive there with Grusha , we will set to work at once on the land , in solitude , somewhere very remote , with wild bears . 
There must be some remote parts even there . 
I am told there are still Redskins there , somewhere , on the edge of the horizon . 
So to the country of the Last of the Mohicans , and there we 'll tackle the grammar at once , Grusha and I. Work and grammar - that 's how we 'll spend three years . 
And by that time we shall speak English like any Englishman . 
And as soon as we 've learnt it - good-bye to America ! 
We 'll run here to Russia as American citizens . 
Do n't be uneasy - we would not come to this little town . 
We 'd hide somewhere , a long way off , in the north or in the south . 
I shall be changed by that time , and she will , too , in America .
