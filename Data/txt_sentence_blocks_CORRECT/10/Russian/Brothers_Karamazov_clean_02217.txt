- that was the question . 
No , she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya despised her for her bowing down to him ! 
She believed it herself . 
She had been firmly convinced , perhaps ever since that bow , that the simplehearted Mitya , who even then adored her , was laughing at her and despising her . 
She had loved him with an hysterical , `` lacerated '' love only from pride , from wounded pride , and that love was not like love , but more like revenge . 
Oh ! 
perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love , perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that , but Mitya 's faithlessness had wounded her to the bottom of her heart , and her heart could not forgive him . 
The moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly , and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended woman 's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly . 
She betrayed Mitya , but she betrayed herself , too . 
And no sooner had she given full expression to her feelings than the tension of course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame .
