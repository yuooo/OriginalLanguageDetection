Here 's Berg coming to see us , '' said she , looking out of the window . 
Berg , the Rostovs ' son-in-law , was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vladimir and Anna , and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army . 
On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army . 
He had nothing to do in Moscow , but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there . 
So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons . 
Berg drove up to his father-in-law 's house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans , exactly like those of a certain prince . 
He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it . 
From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room , where he embraced the count , kissed the hands of Natasha and Sonya , and hastened to inquire after `` Mamma 's '' health . 
`` Health , at a time like this ? '' 
said the count .
