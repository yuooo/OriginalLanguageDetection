On returning home Petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away . 
And next day , Count Ilya Rostov -- though he had not yet quite yielded -- went to inquire how he could arrange for Petya to serve where there would be least danger . 
Two days later , on the fifteenth of July , an immense number of carriages were standing outside the Sloboda Palace . 
The great halls were full . 
In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms , in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals . 
In the noblemen 's hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices . 
The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor , but most of the gentry were strolling about the room . 
All these nobles , whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own houses , were in uniform -- some in that of Catherine 's day , others in that of Emperor Paul , others again in the new uniforms of Alexander 's time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility , and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities , both old and young . 
The old men , dim-eyed , toothless , bald , sallow , and bloated , or gaunt and wrinkled , were especially striking . 
For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent , or , if they walked about and talked , attached themselves to someone younger .
