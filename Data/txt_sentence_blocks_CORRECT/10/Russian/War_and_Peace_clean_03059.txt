He kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible , not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households . 
He was hard alike on the lazy , the depraved , and the weak , and tried to get them expelled from the commune . 
He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants ' hay and corn as of his own , and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well , or got so good a return , as did Nicholas . 
He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs -- the `` drones '' as he called them -- and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity . 
When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf , especially if one had to be punished , he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house ; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation . 
He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants . 
He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions . 
He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man , or to make things easy for or reward anyone , merely because he felt inclined to do so . 
He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do , but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind . 
Often , speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity , he would say : `` What can one do with our Russian peasants ? ''
