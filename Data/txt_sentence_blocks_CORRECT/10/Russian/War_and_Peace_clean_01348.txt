The princess never thought of that proud word `` justice . '' 
All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law -- the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God . 
What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people ? 
She had to endure and love , and that she did . 
During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay , gentle , and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long time past . 
She felt that something had happened to him , but he said nothing to her about his love . 
Before he left he had a long talk with his father about something , and Princess Mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another . 
Soon after Prince Andrew had gone , Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Karagina in Petersburg , whom she had dreamed -LRB- as all girls dream -RRB- of marrying to her brother , and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother , killed in Turkey . 
Sorrow , it seems , is our common lot , my dear , tender friend Julie . 
Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a special providence of God who , loving you , wishes to try you and your excellent mother .
