After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov 's , the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion , at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father , Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance . 
`` Had the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her former lover , nothing would have happened . 
But she lost her head , she could only swear and protest her ignorance , and if the prisoner did not kill her on the spot , it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false mistress . 
`` But note , frantic as he was , he took with him a brass pestle . 
Why that ? 
Why not some other weapon ? 
But since he had been contemplating his plan and preparing himself for it for a whole month , he would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his eye . 
He had realised for a month past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon , so he instantly , without hesitation , recognised that it would serve his purpose . 
So it was by no means unconsciously , by no means involuntarily , that he snatched up that fatal pestle . 
And then we find him in his father 's garden - the coast is clear , there are no witnesses , darkness and jealousy .
