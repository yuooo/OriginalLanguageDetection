The lunatic 's solemn , gloomy face was thin and yellow , with its beard growing in uneven tufts . 
His black , agate pupils with saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids . 
`` Stop ! 
Pull up , I tell you ! '' 
he cried in a piercing voice , and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures . 
Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it . 
`` Thrice have they slain me , thrice have I risen from the dead . 
They stoned me , crucified me ... I shall rise ... shall rise ... shall rise . 
They have torn my body . 
The kingdom of God will be overthrown ... Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it ! ''
