Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha 's arrival . 
Alyosha `` pierced his heart '' by `` living with him , seeing everything and blaming nothing . '' 
Moreover , Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known before : a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable kindness , a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little . 
All this was a complete surprise to the old profligate , who had dropped all family ties . 
It was a new and surprising experience for him , who had till then loved nothing but `` evil . '' 
When Alyosha had left him , he confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to learn . 
I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaida Ivanovna , the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri , and that he had , on the contrary , protected Sofya Ivanovna , the poor `` crazy woman , '' against his master and anyone who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her . 
His sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him , so that even now , twenty years after , he could not bear a slighting allusion to her from anyone , and would at once check the offender . 
Externally , Grigory was cold , dignified and taciturn , and spoke , weighing his words , without frivolity . 
It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he loved his meek , obedient wife ; but he really did love her , and she knew it .
