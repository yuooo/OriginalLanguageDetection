`` The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home , '' said the valet . 
But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send , the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair -LRB- two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet -RRB- entered the room , calm and majestic , except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow . 
With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet . 
She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it . 
She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room . 
Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles , and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies , he tried to continue reading . 
But feeling this to be senseless and impossible , he again glanced timidly at her . 
She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile , waiting for the valet to go . 
`` Well , what 's this now ? 
What have you been up to now , I should like to know ? ''
