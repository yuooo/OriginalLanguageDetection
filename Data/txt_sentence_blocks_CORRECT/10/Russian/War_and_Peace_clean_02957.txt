To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man , the natural method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign -- to transfer the authority to the Emperor himself , thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chief 's feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change . 
With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the Emperor . 
Toll , Konovnitsyn , and Ermolov received fresh appointments . 
Everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal 's great weakness and failing health . 
His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another . 
And in fact his health was poor . 
So naturally , simply , and gradually -- just as he had come from Turkey to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia , and then to the army when he was needed there -- now when his part was played out , Kutuzov 's place was taken by a new and necessary performer . 
The war 1812 , besides its national significance dear to every Russian heart , was now to assume another , a European , significance . 
The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west , and for this fresh war another leader was necessary , having qualities and views differing from Kutuzov 's and animated by different motives . 
Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of Russia .
