For some time he engrossed the general attention , and Anna Pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors . 
The greatest attention of all to Boris ' narrative was shown by Helene . 
She asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army . 
As soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile . 
`` You absolutely must come and see me , '' she said in a tone that implied that , for certain considerations he could not know of , this was absolutely necessary . 
`` On Tuesday between eight and nine . 
It will give me great pleasure . '' 
Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation with her , when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt wished to hear him . 
`` You know her husband , of course ? '' 
said Anna Pavlovna , closing her eyes and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture .
