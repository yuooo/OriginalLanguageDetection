Prince Vasili 's son , Hippolyte , had come with Mortemart , whom he introduced . 
The Abbe Morio and many others had also come . 
* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg . 
To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said , `` You have not yet seen my aunt , '' or `` You do not know my aunt ? '' 
and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady , wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap , who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive ; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt , Anna Pavlovna mentioned each one 's name and then left them . 
Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew , not one of them wanted to know , and not one of them cared about ; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval . 
The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words , about their health and her own , and the health of Her Majesty , `` who , thank God , was better today . '' 
And each visitor , though politeness prevented his showing impatience , left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening . 
The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag .
