`` Your excellency ... '' `` Well , your excellency , what ? 
Your excellency ! 
But what about your excellency ? 
... nobody knows . '' 
`` Your excellency , it 's the officer Dolokhov , who has been reduced to the ranks , '' said the captain softly . 
`` Well ? 
Has he been degraded into a field marshal , or into a soldier ? 
If a soldier , he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others . '' 
`` Your excellency , you gave him leave yourself , on the march . ''
