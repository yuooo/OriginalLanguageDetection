And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it . 
He ordered his horse at once and , coldly taking leave of Boris , rode home . 
Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant , or really let the matter drop , was the question that worried him all the way . 
He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol , and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated .

The two Emperors , the Russian with his heir the Tsarevich , and the Austrian with the Archduke , inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men . 
From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move , forming up on the field before the fortress .
