His face was depressed and gloomy . 
He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem . 
The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess , his cousin , at Moscow , concerning Dolokhov 's intimacy with his wife , and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning , which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles , but that his wife 's connection with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself . 
Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess ' hints and the letter , but he feared now to look at Dolokhov , who was sitting opposite him . 
Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov 's handsome insolent eyes , Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away . 
Involuntarily recalling his wife 's past and her relations with Dolokhov , Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true , or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife . 
He involuntarily remembered how Dolokhov , who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign , had returned to Petersburg and come to him . 
Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion , Dolokhov had come straight to his house , and Pierre had put him up and lent him money . 
Pierre recalled how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov 's living at their house , and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife 's beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day . 
`` Yes , he is very handsome , '' thought Pierre , `` and I know him .
