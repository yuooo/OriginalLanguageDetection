Lazarev sat in the place of honor . 
Russian and French officers embraced him , congratulated him , and pressed his hands . 
Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him . 
A rumble of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square . 
Two officers with flushed faces , looking cheerful and happy , passed by Rostov . 
`` What d'you think of the treat ? 
All on silver plate , '' one of them was saying . 
`` Have you seen Lazarev ? '' 
`` I have . '' 
`` Tomorrow , I hear , the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner . ''
