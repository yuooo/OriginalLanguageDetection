Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov , he could not help taking notice of the soldier . 
`` Your excellency , here are two trophies , '' said Dolokhov , pointing to the French sword and pouch . 
`` I have taken an officer prisoner . 
I stopped the company . '' 
Dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences . 
`` The whole company can bear witness . 
I beg you will remember this , your excellency ! '' 
`` All right , all right , '' replied the commander , and turned to Major Ekonomov . 
But Dolokhov did not go away ; he untied the handkerchief around his head , pulled it off , and showed the blood congealed on his hair .
