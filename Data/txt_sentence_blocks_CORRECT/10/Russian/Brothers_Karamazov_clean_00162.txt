Saying this , Dmitri bowed once more . 
Then , turning suddenly towards his father , made him , too , a similarly low and respectful bow . 
He had evidently considered it beforehand , and made this bow in all seriousness , thinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions . 
Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares , he was equal to the occasion . 
In response to Dmitri 's bow he jumped up from his chair and made his son a bow as low in return . 
His face was suddenly solemn and impressive , which gave him a positively malignant look . 
Dmitri bowed generally to all present , and without a word walked to the window with his long , resolute stride , sat down on the only empty chair , near Father Paissy , and , bending forward , prepared to listen to the conversation he had interrupted . 
Dmitri 's entrance had taken no more than two minutes , and the conversation was resumed . 
But this time Miusov thought it unnecessary to reply to Father Paissy 's persistent and almost irritable question . 
`` Allow me to withdraw from this discussion , '' he observed with a certain well-bred nonchalance .
