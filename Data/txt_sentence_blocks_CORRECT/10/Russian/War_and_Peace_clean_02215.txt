But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army . 
When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk , Kutuzov , guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin 's looks that the news was bad , rose as if to stretch his legs and , taking Scherbinin 's arm , led him aside . 
`` Go , my dear fellow , '' he said to Ermolov , `` and see whether something ca n't be done . '' 
Kutuzov was in Gorki , near the center of the Russian position . 
The attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed . 
In the center the French had not got beyond Borodino , and on their left flank Uvarov 's cavalry had put the French to flight . 
Toward three o'clock the French attacks ceased . 
On the faces of all who came from the field of battle , and of those who stood around him , Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension . 
He was satisfied with the day 's success -- a success exceeding his expectations , but the old man 's strength was failing him . 
Several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off .
