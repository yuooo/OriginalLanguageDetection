Mitya broke off his clumsy speech with that , `` so you see ! '' 
and jumping up from his seat , awaited the answer to his foolish proposal . 
At the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen flat , above all , that he had been talking utter nonsense . 
`` How strange it is !

The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind . 
All the while he had been talking , the old man sat motionless , watching him with an icy expression in his eyes . 
After keeping him for a moment in suspense , Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone : `` Excuse me , we do n't undertake such business . '' 
Mitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him . 
`` What am I to do now , Kuzma Kuzmitch ? ''
