`` Do you know , Alyosha , do you know , I should like - Alyosha , save me ! '' 
She suddenly jumped from the couch , rushed to him and seized him with both hands . 
`` Save me ! '' 
she almost groaned . 
`` Is there anyone in the world I could tell what I 've told you ? 
I 've told you the truth , the truth . 
I shall kill myself , because I loathe everything ! 
I do n't want to live , because I loathe everything ! 
I loathe everything , everything . 
Alyosha , why do n't you love me in the least ? ''
