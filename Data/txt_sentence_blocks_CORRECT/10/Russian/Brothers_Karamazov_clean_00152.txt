Consequently the security of society is not preserved , for , although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight , another criminal always comes to take his place at once , and often two of them . 
If anything does preserve society , even in our time , and does regenerate and transform the criminal , it is only the law of Christ speaking in his conscience . 
It is only by recognising his wrongdoing as a son of a Christian society - that is , of the Church - that he recognises his sin against society - that is , against the Church . 
So that it is only against the Church , and not against the State , that the criminal of to-day can recognise that he has sinned . 
If society , as a Church , had jurisdiction , then it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to itself . 
Now the Church having no real jurisdiction , but only the power of moral condemnation , withdraws of her own accord from punishing the criminal actively . 
She does not excommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of him . 
What is more , the Church even tries to preserve all Christian communion with the criminal . 
She admits him to church services , to the holy sacrament , gives him alms , and treats him more a captive than as a convict . 
And what would become of the criminal , O Lord , if even the Christian society - that is , the Church - were to reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off ?
