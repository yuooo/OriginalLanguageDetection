cried Rostov . 
`` He told me I lied , and I told him he lied . 
And there it rests . 
He may keep me on duty every day , or may place me under arrest , but no one can make me apologize , because if he , as commander of this regiment , thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction , then ... '' `` You just wait a moment , my dear fellow , and listen , '' interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass , calmly stroking his long mustache . 
`` You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen ... '' `` I 'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers . 
Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them , but I am not a diplomatist . 
That 's why I joined the hussars , thinking that here one would not need finesse ; and he tells me that I am lying -- so let him give me satisfaction ... '' `` That 's all right . 
No one thinks you a coward , but that 's not the point . 
Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander ? '' 
Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation , evidently with no wish to take part in it .
