And the fire of corruption is spreading visibly , hourly , working from above downwards . 
The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too . 
Money-lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up . 
Already the merchant grows more and more eager for rank , and strives to show himself cultured though he has not a trace of culture , and to this end meanly despises his old traditions , and is even ashamed of the faith of his fathers . 
He visits princes , though he is only a peasant corrupted . 
The peasants are rotting in drunkenness and can not shake off the habit . 
And what cruelty to their wives , to their children even ! 
All from drunkenness ! 
I 've seen in the factories children of nine years old , frail , rickety , bent and already depraved . 
The stuffy workshop , the din of machinery , work all day long , the vile language and the drink , the drink - is that what a little child 's heart needs ?
