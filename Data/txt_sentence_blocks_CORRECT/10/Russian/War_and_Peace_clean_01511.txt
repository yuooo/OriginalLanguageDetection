He was always conscious of some aspect of that skein , as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read . 
But under the influence of wine he said to himself : `` It does n't matter . 
I 'll get it unraveled . 
I have a solution ready , but have no time now -- I 'll think it all out later on ! '' 
But the later on never came . 
In the morning , on an empty stomach , all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever , and Pierre hastily picked up a book , and if anyone came to see him he was glad . 
Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the enemy 's fire , if they have nothing to do , try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger . 
To Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers , seeking refuge from life : some in ambition , some in cards , some in framing laws , some in women , some in toys , some in horses , some in politics , some in sport , some in wine , and some in governmental affairs . 
`` Nothing is trivial , and nothing is important , it 's all the same -- only to save oneself from it as best one can , '' thought Pierre . 
`` Only not to see it , that dreadful it ! ''
