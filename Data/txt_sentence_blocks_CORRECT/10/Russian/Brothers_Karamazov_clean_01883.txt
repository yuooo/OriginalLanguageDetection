` On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my affections ' - he thought of that for a title . 
He 's a waggish fellow . 
A captivating little foot , Though swollen and red and tender ! 
The doctors come and plasters put , But still they can not mend her . 
Yet , 't is not for her foot I dread - A theme for Pushkin 's muse more fit - It 's not her foot , it is her head : I tremble for her loss of wit ! 
For as her foot swells , strange to say , Her intellect is on the wane - Oh , for some remedy I pray That may restore both foot and brain ! 
He is a pig , a regular pig , but he 's very arch , the rascal ! 
And he really has put in a progressive idea . 
And was n't he angry when she kicked him out ! 
He was gnashing his teeth ! ''
