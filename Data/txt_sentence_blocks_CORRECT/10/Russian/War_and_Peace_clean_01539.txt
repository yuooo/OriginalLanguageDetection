Only a few of these young men , among them Boris , entered more deeply into Julie 's melancholy , and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things , and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches , maxims , and verses . 
To Boris , Julie was particularly gracious : she regretted his early disillusionment with life , offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render , and showed him her album . 
Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote : `` Rustic trees , your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me . '' 
On another page he drew a tomb , and wrote : La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille . 
Ah ! 
contre les douleurs il n ' y a pas d'autre asile . 
* * Death gives relief and death is peaceful . 
Ah ! 
from suffering there is no other refuge . 
Julia said this was charming `` There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy , '' she said to Boris , repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book .
