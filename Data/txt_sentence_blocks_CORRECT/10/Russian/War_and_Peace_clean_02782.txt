On August 24 Davydov 's first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized . 
The further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became . 
The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal . 
They gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree - the French army -- and sometimes shook that tree itself . 
By October , when the French were fleeing toward Smolensk , there were hundreds of such companies , of various sizes and characters . 
There were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry , artillery , staffs , and the comforts of life . 
Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry . 
There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse , and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown . 
A sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month ; and there was Vasilisa , the wife of a village elder , who slew hundreds of the French . 
The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of October .
