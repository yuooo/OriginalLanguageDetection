Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition . 
A lump of snow can not be melted instantaneously . 
There is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow .

When the flight of the French army along the Smolensk road became well defined , what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began to occur .

Kutuzov alone used all his power -LRB- and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief -RRB- to prevent an attack . 
He could not tell them what we say now : `` Why fight , why block the road , losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches ? 
What is the use of that , when a third of their army has melted away on the road from Moscow to Vyazma without any battle ? ''
