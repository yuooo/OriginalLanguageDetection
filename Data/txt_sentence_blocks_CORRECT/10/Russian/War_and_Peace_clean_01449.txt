There an old footman and two young ones were playing cards . 
They broke off and rose as she entered . 
`` What can I do with them ? '' 
thought Natasha . 
`` Oh , Nikita , please go ... where can I send him ? 
... Yes , go to the yard and fetch a fowl , please , a cock , and you , Misha , bring me some oats . '' 
`` Just a few oats ? '' 
said Misha , cheerfully and readily . 
`` Go , go quickly , '' the old man urged him . 
`` And you , Theodore , get me a piece of chalk . ''
