I wanted to prove what he was , and what happened ? 
He took it , he took it , and squandered it with that creature in one night ... . 
But he knew , he knew that I knew all about it . 
I assure you he understood , too , that I gave him that money to test him , to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honour as to take it from me . 
I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine , and he understood it all and he took it - he carried off my money ! 
`` That 's true , Katya , '' Mitya roared suddenly , `` I looked into your eyes and I knew that you were dishonouring me , and yet I took your money . 
Despise me as a scoundrel , despise me , all of you ! 
I 've deserved it ! ''
