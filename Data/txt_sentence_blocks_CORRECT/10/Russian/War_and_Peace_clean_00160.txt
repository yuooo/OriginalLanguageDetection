`` You , my little countess , are a notorious spendthrift , '' said the count , and having kissed his wife 's hand he went back to his study . 
When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov 's the money , all in clean notes , was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess ' little table , and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her . 
`` Well , my dear ? '' 
asked the countess . 
`` Oh , what a terrible state he is in ! 
One would not know him , he is so ill ! 
I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word ... '' `` Annette , for heaven 's sake do n't refuse me , '' the countess began , with a blush that looked very strange on her thin , dignified , elderly face , and she took the money from under the handkerchief . 
Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment . 
`` This is for Boris from me , for his outfit . '' 
Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping .
