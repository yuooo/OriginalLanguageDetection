What troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner , there is not a single one certain and irrefutable . 
And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation of these facts . 
Yes , the accumulated effect is awful : the blood , the blood dripping from his fingers , the bloodstained shirt , the dark night resounding with the shout ` Parricide ! ' 
and the old man falling with a broken head . 
And then the mass of phrases , statements , gestures , shouts ! 
Oh ! 
this has so much influence , it can so bias the mind ; but , gentlemen of the jury , can it bias your minds ? 
Remember , you have been given absolute power to bind and to loose , but the greater the power , the more terrible its responsibility . 
`` I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now , but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had stained his hands with his father 's blood . 
This is only hypothesis , I repeat ; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence .
