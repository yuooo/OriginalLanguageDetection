`` All that is only momentary , I know him , I know his heart only too well . 
You may be sure he will consent to escape . 
It 's not as though it would be immediately ; he will have time to make up his mind to it .

Do n't be anxious ; he will consent to run away . 
He has agreed already : do you suppose he would give up that creature ? 
And they wo n't let her go to him , so he is bound to escape . 
It 's you he 's most afraid of , he is afraid you wo n't approve of his escape on moral grounds . 
But you must generously allow it , if your sanction is so necessary , '' Katya added viciously . 
She paused and smiled .
