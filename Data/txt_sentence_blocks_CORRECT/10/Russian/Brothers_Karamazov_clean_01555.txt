`` Yes , what you said just now , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , looking at him surprise , `` that is , that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her ... . 
I assure you , that 's a very important piece of evidence for us , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you , particularly important for you . '' 
`` Have mercy , gentlemen ! '' 
Mitya flung up his hands . 
`` Do n't write that , anyway ; have some shame .

Oh , my God ! ''
