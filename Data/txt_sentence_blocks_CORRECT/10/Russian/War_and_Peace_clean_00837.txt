A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls ' voices came from the adjoining room . 
The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue , of ribbons , black hair , and merry faces . 
It was Natasha , Sonya , and Petya , who had come to see whether they were getting up . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Get up ! '' 
Natasha 's voice was again heard at the door . 
`` Directly ! '' 
Meanwhile , Petya , having found and seized the sabers in the outer room , with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother , and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed , opened the bedroom door . 
`` Is this your saber ? '' 
he shouted .
