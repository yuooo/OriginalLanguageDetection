The captain returned to the room , limping slightly and whistling a tune . 
The Frenchman 's chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled him . 
The tune he was whistling , his gait , and the gesture with which he twirled his mustache , all now seemed offensive . 
`` I will go away immediately . 
I wo n't say another word to him , '' thought Pierre . 
He thought this , but still sat in the same place . 
A strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot ; he wished to get up and go away , but could not do so . 
The captain , on the other hand , seemed very cheerful . 
He paced up and down the room twice . 
His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought .
