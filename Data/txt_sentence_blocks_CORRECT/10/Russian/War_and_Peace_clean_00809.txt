Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall . 
Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions , they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph , generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds , and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved . 
`` Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost ? 
No , certainly I must not approach him , I must not intrude on his reflections . 
Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him , '' Rostov decided ; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away , continually looking back at the Tsar , who still remained in the same attitude of indecision . 
While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away , Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot , and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him , offered his services , and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot . 
The Emperor , wishing to rest and feeling unwell , sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him . 
Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor , evidently weeping , covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll 's hand . 
`` And I might have been in his place ! '' 
thought Rostov , and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor , he rode on in utter despair , not knowing where to or why he was now riding .
