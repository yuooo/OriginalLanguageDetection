`` It 's a good thing you came , '' said Ivan , as though brooding , and not hearing Alyosha 's exclamation . 
`` I knew he had hanged himself . '' 
`` From whom ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
But I knew . 
Did I know ? 
Yes , he told me . 
He told me so just now . '' 
Ivan stood in the middle of the room , and still spoke in the same brooding tone , looking at the ground . 
`` Who is he ? ''
