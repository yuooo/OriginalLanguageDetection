Well , whatever it may be ... '' And shouting to his horses , he began to pass the first sleigh . 
Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face , which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows . 
Nicholas gave the horses the rein , and Zakhar , stretching out his arms , clucked his tongue and let his horses go . 
`` Now , look out , master ! '' 
he cried . 
Faster still the two troykas flew side by side , and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses . 
Nicholas began to draw ahead . 
Zakhar , while still keeping his arms extended , raised one hand with the reins . 
`` No you wo n't , master ! '' 
he shouted .
