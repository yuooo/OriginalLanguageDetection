A carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole . 
Several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides : some beat the carriage horses on their heads , turning them aside , others fought among themselves , and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head by a sword . 
It seemed that all these men , now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening , experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start . 
Once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going , and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey . 
During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start . 
It was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration . 
From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners , in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations . 
This spite increased still more when , on calling over the roll of prisoners , it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian soldier , who had pretended to suffer from colic , had escaped . 
Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road , and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the Russian . 
To the noncommissioned officer 's excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk , the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind .
