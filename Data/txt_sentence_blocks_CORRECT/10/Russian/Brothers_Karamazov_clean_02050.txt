The visitor 's check trousers were of excellent cut , but were too light in colour and too tight for the present fashion . 
His soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season . 
* Fiftyish . 
In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means . 
It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom . 
He had unmistakably been , at some time , in good and fashionable society , had once had good connections , had possibly preserved them indeed , but , after a gay youth , becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom , he had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best class , wandering from one good old friend to another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating disposition and as being , after all , a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with anyone , though , of course , not in a place of honour . 
Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position , who can tell a story , take a hand at cards , and who have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon them , are usually solitary creatures , either bachelors or widowers . 
Sometimes they have children , but if so , the children are always being brought up at a distance , at some aunt 's , to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society , seeming ashamed of the relationship . 
They gradually lose sight of their children altogether , though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it . 
The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured , as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might arise .
