`` Yes , I saw him , and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement , '' repeated Dolgorukov , evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon . 
`` If he were n't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview ? 
Why negotiate , and above all why retreat , when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war ? 
Believe me , he is afraid , afraid of a general battle . 
His hour has come ! 
Mark my words ! '' 
`` But tell me , what is he like , eh ? '' 
said Prince Andrew again . 
`` He is a man in a gray overcoat , very anxious that I should call him ` Your Majesty , ' but who , to his chagrin , got no title from me ! 
That 's the sort of man he is , and nothing more , '' replied Dolgorukov , looking round at Bilibin with a smile .
