A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners . 
From all sides came shouts of command , and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses , passing the prisoners at a trot . 
The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority . 
The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road . 
The convoy formed up . 
`` The Emperor ! 
The Emperor ! 
The Marshal ! 
The Duke ! '' 
and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed , before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by .
