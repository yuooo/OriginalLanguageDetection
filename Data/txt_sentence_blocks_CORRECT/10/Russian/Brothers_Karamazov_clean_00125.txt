God will not take you from us . 
You will live a long , long time yet , '' cried the lady . 
`` And in what way are you ill ? 
You look so well , so gay and happy . '' 
`` I am extraordinarily better to-day . 
But I know that it 's only for a moment . 
I understand my disease now thoroughly . 
If I seem so happy to you , you could never say anything that would please me so much . 
For men are made for happiness , and anyone who is completely happy has a right to say to himself , ' I am doing God 's will on earth . ' 
All the righteous , all the saints , all the holy martyrs were happy . ''
