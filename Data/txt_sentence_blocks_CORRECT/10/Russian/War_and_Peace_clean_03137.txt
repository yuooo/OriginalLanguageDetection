-- from that moment this conversation began , contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time . 
This simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another . 
Just as in a dream when all is uncertain , unreasoning , and contradictory , except the feeling that guides the dream , so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason , the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them . 
Natasha spoke to Pierre about her brother 's life and doings , of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence , and of how she was fonder than ever of Mary , and how Mary was in every way better than herself . 
In saying this Natasha was sincere in acknowledging Mary 's superiority , but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on Pierre that he should , all the same , prefer her to Mary and to all other women , and that now , especially after having seen many women in Petersburg , he should tell her so afresh . 
Pierre , answering Natasha 's words , told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg . 
`` I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies , '' he said . 
`` It was simply dull . 
Besides , I was very busy . '' 
Natasha looked intently at him and went on : `` Mary is so splendid , '' she said .
