The chief steward , who considered the young count 's attempts almost insane -- unprofitable to himself , to the count , and to the serfs -- made some concessions . 
Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable , he arranged for the erection of large buildings -- schools , hospitals , and asylums -- on all the estates before the master arrived . 
Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes -LRB- which he knew Pierre would not like -RRB- , but for just such gratefully religious ones , with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality , as , according to his understanding of his master , would touch and delude him . 
The southern spring , the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage , and the solitude of the road , all had a gladdening effect on Pierre . 
The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other ; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them . 
Everywhere were receptions , which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart . 
In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul , asking permission , as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them , to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul , his patron saints . 
In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work . 
On a third estate the priest , bearing a cross , came to meet him surrounded by children whom , by the count 's generosity , he was instructing in reading , writing , and religion . 
On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection , all on one plan , for hospitals , schools , and almshouses , which were soon to be opened .
