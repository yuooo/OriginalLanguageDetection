Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares , but he continued to speak , surprising them by empty witticisms . 
Gradually , unnoticed , all these persons began to disappear and a single question , that of the closed door , superseded all else . 
He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it . 
Everything depended on whether he was , or was not , in time to lock it . 
He went , and tried to hurry , but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers . 
He was seized by an agonizing fear . 
And that fear was the fear of death . 
It stood behind the door . 
But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door , that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in . 
Something not human -- death -- was breaking in through that door , and had to be kept out .
