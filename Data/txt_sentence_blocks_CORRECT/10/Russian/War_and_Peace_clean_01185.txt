It was hot in the room , the inside shutters of which were closed . 
He was cross with the stupid old man -LRB- as he called Rostov -RRB- , who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town , and he was vexed with himself for having stayed . 
He got up and went to the window to open it . 
As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight , as if it had long been watching for this , burst into the room . 
He opened the casement . 
The night was fresh , bright , and very still . 
Just before the window was a row of pollard trees , looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other . 
Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush , wet , bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there . 
Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew , to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches , and above it shone the moon , nearly at its full , in a pale , almost starless , spring sky . 
Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky .
