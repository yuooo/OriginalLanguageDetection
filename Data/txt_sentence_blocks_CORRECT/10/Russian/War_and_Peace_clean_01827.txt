On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late , and particularly so on this bright , hot summer day in town . 
`` It 's Sunday again -- another week past , '' she thought , recalling that she had been here the Sunday before , `` and always the same life that is no life , and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live . 
I 'm pretty , I 'm young , and I know that now I am good . 
I used to be bad , but now I know I am good , '' she thought , `` but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone . '' 
She stood by her mother 's side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her . 
From habit she scrutinized the ladies ' dresses , condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner , and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others , and suddenly , at the sound of the service , she felt horrified at her own vileness , horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her . 
A comely , fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers . 
The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed , the curtain was slowly drawn , and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words . 
Tears , the cause of which she herself did not understand , made Natasha 's breast heave , and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her . 
`` Teach me what I should do , how to live my life , how I may grow good forever , forever ! ''
