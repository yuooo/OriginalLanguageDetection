Look there ! '' 
one soldier was saying to another , pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier . 
`` Hark to him jabbering ! 
Fine , is n't it ? 
It 's all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him . 
There now , Sidorov ! '' 
`` Wait a bit and listen . 
It 's fine ! '' 
answered Sidorov , who was considered an adept at French . 
The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov .
