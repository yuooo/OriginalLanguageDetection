His mother was mistaken ; he was very fond of her . 
He only disliked `` sheepish sentimentality , '' as he expressed it in his schoolboy language . 
There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his father 's . 
Kolya was fond of reading , and had read several of them by himself . 
His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play . 
And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age . 
Though the boy , as a rule , knew where to draw the line in his mischief , he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm . 
It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did , but a wild mad recklessness . 
It happened that July , during the summer holidays , that the mother and son went to another district , forty-five miles away , to spend a week with a distant relation , whose husband was an official at the railway station -LRB- the very station , the nearest one to our town , from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow -RRB- . 
There Kolya began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways , knowing that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge .
