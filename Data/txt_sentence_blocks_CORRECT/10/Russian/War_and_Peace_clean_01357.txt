he asked his daughter . 
`` She 'll make a splendid princess ! '' 
And latterly , to her surprise and bewilderment , Princess Mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the Frenchwoman . 
She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his letter , but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea . 
Little Nicholas and his education , her brother Andrew , and religion were Princess Mary 's joys and consolations ; but besides that , since everyone must have personal hopes , Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life . 
This comforting dream and hope were given her by God 's folk -- the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the prince 's knowledge . 
The longer she lived , the more experience and observation she had of life , the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth : toiling , suffering , struggling , and harming one another , to obtain that impossible , visionary , sinful happiness . 
Prince Andrew had loved his wife , she died , but that was not enough : he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman . 
Her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew . 
And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls , their eternal souls , for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant .
