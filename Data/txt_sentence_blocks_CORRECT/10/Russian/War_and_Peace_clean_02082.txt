-LRB- This was the battle of Shevardino . -RRB- 
He was told that there in Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing , but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won . 
At dawn next day Pierre was approaching Mozhaysk . 
Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it , and at the hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had . 
It was full of officers . 
Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it , troops were stationed or on the march . 
Cossacks , foot and horse soldiers , wagons , caissons , and cannon were everywhere . 
Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could , and the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before . 
It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the Sloboda Palace during the Emperor 's visit -- a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something . 
He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men 's happiness -- the comforts of life , wealth , even life itself -- is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away , compared with something ... With what ?
