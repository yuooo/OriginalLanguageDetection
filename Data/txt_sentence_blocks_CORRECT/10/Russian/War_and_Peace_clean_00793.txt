He could see nothing more , for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything . 
At that moment , as the Horse Guards , having passed him , disappeared in the smoke , Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent . 
This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves . 
Rostov was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men , of all those brilliant , rich youths , officers and cadets , who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses , only eighteen were left after the charge . 
`` Why should I envy them ? 
My chance is not lost , and maybe I shall see the Emperor immediately ! '' 
thought Rostov and galloped on . 
When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying , of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers ' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers . 
Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a voice calling him by name .
