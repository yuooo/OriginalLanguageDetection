Coming at twenty to his father 's house , which was a very sink of filthy debauchery , he , chaste and pure as he was , simply withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable , but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation . 
His father , who had once been in a dependent position , and so was sensitive and ready to take offence , met him at first with distrust and sullenness . 
`` He does not say much , '' he used to say , `` and thinks the more . '' 
But soon , within a fortnight indeed , he took to embracing him and kissing him terribly often , with drunken tears , with sottish sentimentality , yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him , such as he had never been capable of feeling for anyone before . 
Everyone , indeed , loved this young man wherever he went , and it was so from his earliest childhood . 
When he entered the household of his patron and benefactor , Yefim Petrovitch Polenov , he gained the hearts of all the family , so that they looked on him quite as their own child . 
Yet he entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning affection . 
So that the gift of making himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him , in his very nature , so to speak . 
It was the same at school , though he seemed to be just one of those children who are distrusted , sometimes ridiculed , and even disliked by their schoolfellows . 
He was dreamy , for instance , and rather solitary .
