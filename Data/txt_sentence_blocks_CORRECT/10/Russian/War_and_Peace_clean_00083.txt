`` Oh ! 
Oh ! 
Oh ! '' 
he muttered , looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement . 
`` Shut up ! '' 
cried Dolokhov , pushing him away from the window . 
The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room , tripping over his spurs . 
Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily , Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs . 
Pressing against both sides of the window , he adjusted himself on his seat , lowered his hands , moved a little to the right and then to the left , and took up the bottle . 
Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill , though it was already quite light .
