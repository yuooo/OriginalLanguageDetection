Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked . 
He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class , and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid . 
The whole summer , from spring sowing to harvest , he was busy with the work on his farm . 
In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness -- leaving home for a month , or even two , with his hunt . 
In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading . 
The books he read were chiefly historical , and on these he spent a certain sum every year . 
He was collecting , as he said , a serious library , and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought . 
He would sit in his study with a grave air , reading -- a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty , but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters . 
In winter , except for business excursions , he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children 's relations with their mother . 
The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her .
