`` Where did this cart come from in such a hurry ? '' 
he asked Mitya . 
`` I met Andrey as I ran to you , and told him to drive straight here to the shop . 
There 's no time to lose . 
Last time I drove with Timofey , but Timofey now has gone on before me with the witch . 
Shall we be very late , Andrey ? '' 
`` They 'll only get there an hour at most before us , not even that maybe . 
I got Timofey ready to start . 
I know how he 'll go . 
Their pace wo n't be ours , Dmitri Fyodorovitch .
