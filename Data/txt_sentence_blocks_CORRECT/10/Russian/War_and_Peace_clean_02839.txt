`` Why are n't you asleep , sir ? '' 
said a Cossack who was sitting under a wagon . 
`` No , ah ... Likhachev -- is n't that your name ? 
Do you know I have only just come back ! 
We 've been into the French camp . '' 
And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object , and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act `` just anyhow . '' 
`` Well , you should get some sleep now , '' said the Cossack . 
`` No , I am used to this , '' said Petya . 
`` I say , are n't the flints in your pistols worn out ? 
I brought some with me .
