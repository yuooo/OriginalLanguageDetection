He had to be led up , pushed on , excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the idea of deceit . 
The truly jealous man is not like that . 
It is impossible to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without a qualm of conscience . 
And yet it 's not as though the jealous were all vulgar and base souls . 
On the contrary , a man of lofty feelings , whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice , may yet hide under tables , bribe the vilest people , and be familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping . 
Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness - not incapable of forgiving it , but of making up his mind to it - though his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe 's . 
It is not so with the really jealous man . 
It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook , and what they can forgive ! 
The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive , and all women know it . 
The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly -LRB- though , of course , after a violent scene -RRB- , and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved , the very kisses and embraces he has seen , if only he can somehow be convinced that it has all been `` for the last time , '' and that his rival will vanish from that day forward , will depart to the ends of the earth , or that he himself will carry her away somewhere , where that dreaded rival will not get near her .
