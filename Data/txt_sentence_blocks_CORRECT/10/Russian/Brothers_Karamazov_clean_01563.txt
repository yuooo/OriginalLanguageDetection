I believe I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady 's . '' 
`` In your landlady 's cap ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I took it from her . '' 
`` How did you get it ? '' 
`` You see , I remember once taking a cap for a rag , perhaps to wipe my pen on . 
I took it without asking , because it was a worthless rag . 
I tore it up , and I took the notes and sewed them up in it . 
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them . 
An old piece of calico , washed a thousand times . ''
