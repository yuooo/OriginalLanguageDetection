On seeing Rostov , Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting , he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust . 
`` Ugh ! 
I do n't like that fellow , '' he said , regardless of the quartermaster 's presence . 
Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say : `` Nor do I , but what 's one to do ? '' 
and , having given his order , he returned to Telyanin . 
Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left him , rubbing his small white hands . 
`` Well there certainly are disgusting people , '' thought Rostov as he entered . 
`` Have you told them to bring the horse ? '' 
asked Telyanin , getting up and looking carelessly about him . 
`` I have . ''
