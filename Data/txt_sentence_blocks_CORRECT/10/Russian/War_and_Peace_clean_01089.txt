What about ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew with surprise . 
`` About life , about man 's destiny . 
It ca n't be so . 
I myself thought like that , and do you know what saved me ? 
Freemasonry ! 
No , do n't smile . 
Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect , as I thought it was : Freemasonry is the best expression of the best , the eternal , aspects of humanity . '' 
And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew . 
He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church , a teaching of equality , brotherhood , and love .
