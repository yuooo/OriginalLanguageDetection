In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever . 
Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house , disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public . 
One of two relations who lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court , the other remained . 
But if both had gone away , Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution , and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night . 
Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him . 
The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow , refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of the illness . 
Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha , it was evident that they could not yet give them positive hopes of recovery . 
Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day . 
But this time he had specially urgent business , and he foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject , yet he was in great haste . 
He had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning , and there was need of haste .
