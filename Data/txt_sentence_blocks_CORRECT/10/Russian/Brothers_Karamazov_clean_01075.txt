Grushenka cried angrily at him ; `` you never said such words to me as he has come to say . '' 
`` What has he said to you so special ? ''

`` I ca n't say , I do n't know . 
I do n't know what he said to me , it went straight to my heart ; he has wrung my heart ... . 
He is the first , the only one who has pitied me , that 's what it is . 
Why did you not come before , you angel ? '' 
She fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy . 
`` I 've been waiting all my life for someone like you , I knew that someone like you would come and forgive me .
