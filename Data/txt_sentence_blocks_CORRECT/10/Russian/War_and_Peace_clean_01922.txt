Several of them ran into Ferapontov 's yard before Alpatych 's eyes . 
Alpatych went out to the gate . 
A retreating regiment , thronging and hurrying , blocked the street . 
Noticing him , an officer said : `` The town is being abandoned . 
Get away , get away ! '' 
and then , turning to the soldiers , shouted : `` I 'll teach you to run into the yards ! '' 
Alpatych went back to the house , called the coachman , and told him to set off . 
Ferapontov 's whole household came out too , following Alpatych and the coachman . 
The women , who had been silent till then , suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires -- the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight -- and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street . 
Inside the shed Alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands .
