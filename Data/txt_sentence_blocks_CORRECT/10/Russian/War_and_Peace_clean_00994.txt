Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles . 
`` I have heard of you , my dear sir , '' continued the stranger , `` and of your misfortune . '' 
He seemed to emphasize the last word , as if to say -- `` Yes , misfortune ! 
Call it what you please , I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune . '' 
-- `` I regret it very much , my dear sir . '' 
Pierre flushed and , hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed , bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile . 
`` I have not referred to this out of curiosity , my dear sir , but for greater reasons . '' 
He paused , his gaze still on Pierre , and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him . 
Pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man , but , submitting to him involuntarily , came up and sat down beside him . 
`` You are unhappy , my dear sir , '' the stranger continued .
