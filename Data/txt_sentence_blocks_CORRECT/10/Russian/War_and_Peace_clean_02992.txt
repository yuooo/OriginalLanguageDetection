`` No , not once ! 
Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being Napoleon 's guest . 
Not only did I never see him but I heard nothing about him -- I was in much lower company ! '' 
Supper was over , and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so . 
`` But it 's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon ? '' 
Natasha asked with a slight smile . 
`` I guessed it then when we met at the Sukharev tower , do you remember ? '' 
Pierre admitted that it was true , and from that was gradually led by Princess Mary 's questions and especially by Natasha 's into giving a detailed account of his adventures . 
At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself , but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through . 
Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at Natasha .
