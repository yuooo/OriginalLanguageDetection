I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him . 
He was driven home in my carriage . 
And on the top of it all , you and this letter ! 
It 's true nothing can happen for a year and a half . 
In the name of all that 's holy , in the name of your dying elder , show me that letter , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
I 'm her mother . 
Hold it in your hand , if you like , and I will read it so . '' 
`` No , I wo n't show it to you . 
Even if she sanctioned it , I would n't . 
I am coming to-morrow , and if you like , we can talk over many things , but now good-bye ! ''
