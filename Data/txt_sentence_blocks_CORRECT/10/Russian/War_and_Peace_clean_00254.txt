I have written to my poor mother , '' said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly , in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r 's . 
She brought into Princess Mary 's strenuous , mournful , and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere , careless , lighthearted , and self-satisfied . 
`` Princess , I must warn you , '' she added , lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure , and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement , `` the prince has been scolding Michael Ivanovich . 
He is in a very bad humor , very morose . 
Be prepared . '' 
`` Ah , dear friend , '' replied Princess Mary , `` I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in . 
I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so . '' 
The princess glanced at her watch and , seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord , went into the sitting room with a look of alarm . 
Between twelve and two o'clock , as the day was mapped out , the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord . 
The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince , who was in his large study .
