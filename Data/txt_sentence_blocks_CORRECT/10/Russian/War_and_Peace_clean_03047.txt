But remembering her relations with Nicholas in Voronezh she was shy about doing so . 
Making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow . 
Nicholas was the first to meet her , as the countess ' room could only be reached through his . 
But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected , at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold , stiff , proud expression she had not seen on it before . 
He inquired about her health , led the way to his mother , and having sat there for five minutes left the room . 
When the princess came out of the countess ' room Nicholas met her again , and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom . 
To her remarks about his mother 's health he made no reply . 
`` What 's that to you ? 
Leave me in peace , '' his looks seemed to say . 
`` Why does she come prowling here ?
