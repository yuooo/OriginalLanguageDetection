They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee , for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou hast caused , laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems . '' 
` So that , in truth , Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of Thy kingdom , and no one is more to blame for it . 
Yet what was offered Thee ? 
There are three powers , three powers alone , able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness those forces are miracle , mystery and authority . 
Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing so . 
When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee , `` If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself down , for it is written : the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself , and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father . '' 
But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down . 
Oh , of course , Thou didst proudly and well , like God ; but the weak , unruly race of men , are they gods ? 
Oh , Thou didst know then that in taking one step , in making one movement to cast Thyself down , Thou wouldst be tempting God and have lost all Thy faith in Him , and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which Thou didst come to save . 
And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced .
