So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns the direct road from there to Moscow passed . 
Balashev , who was on the alert all through the dinner , replied that just as `` all roads lead to Rome , '' so all roads lead to Moscow : there were many roads , and `` among them the road through Poltava , which Charles XII chose . '' 
Balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply , but hardly had he uttered the word Poltava before Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences . 
After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon 's study , which four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander . 
Napoleon sat down , toying with his Sevres coffee cup , and motioned Balashev to a chair beside him . 
Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which , more than any reasoned cause , makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend . 
It seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him : and he felt convinced that , after his dinner , Balashev too was his friend and worshiper . 
Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant , though slightly ironic , smile . 
`` They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied ?
