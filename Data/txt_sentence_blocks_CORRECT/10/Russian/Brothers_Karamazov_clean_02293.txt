`` That is what has happened to me in the present case , '' he explained . 
`` From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner 's favour . 
What interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice , but rarely , I think , in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case . 
I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech , but I will do so at the very beginning , for it is my weakness to go to work directly , not keeping my effects in reserve and economising my material . 
That may be imprudent on my part , but at least it 's sincere . 
What I have in my mind is this : there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner , and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism , if it is examined separately . 
As I followed the case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed , and I suddenly received from the prisoner 's relatives a request to undertake his defence . 
I at once hurried here , and here I became completely convinced . 
It was to break down this terrible chain of facts , and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic , that I undertook the case . '' 
So Fetyukovitch began .
