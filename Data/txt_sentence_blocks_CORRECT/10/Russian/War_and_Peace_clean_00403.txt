There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers . 
An empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them . 
The enemy ceased firing , and that stern , threatening , inaccessible , and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt . 
`` One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty , suffering , and death . 
And what is there ? 
Who is there ? 
-- there beyond that field , that tree , that roof lit up by the sun ? 
No one knows , but one wants to know . 
You fear and yet long to cross that line , and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there , just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death . 
But you are strong , healthy , cheerful , and excited , and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men . ''
