They began a third game , and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away . 
But by the end of the third game , Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for billiards ; he laid down the cue , and without having supper as he had intended , he walked out of the tavern . 
When he reached the market-place he stood still in perplexity , wondering at himself . 
He realised that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's and find out if anything had happened there . 
`` On account of some stupid nonsense as it 's sure to turn out - am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal ? 
Fooh ! 
damn it , is it my business to look after them ? '' 
In a very bad humour he went straight home , and suddenly remembered Fenya . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I ought to have questioned her just now , '' he thought with vexation , `` I should have heard everything . ''
