`` Do n't worry yourself so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' observed the prosecutor , `` everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards , and what you do n't agree to we 'll alter as you like . 
But now I 'll ask you one little question for the second time . 
Has no one , absolutely no one , heard from you of that money you sewed up ? 
That , I must tell you , is almost impossible to believe . '' 
`` No one , no one , I told you so before , or you 've not understood anything !

And now , too , when you got hold of the money you had yesterday , you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you . '' 
`` You 've got not dozens , but hundreds of witnesses , two hundred witnesses , two hundred have heard it , thousands have heard it ! ''
