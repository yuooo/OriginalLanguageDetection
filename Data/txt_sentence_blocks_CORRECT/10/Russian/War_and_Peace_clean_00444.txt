cried Prince Andrew . 
`` That would be too base . '' 
`` If we live we shall see , '' replied Bilibin , his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end . 
When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows , he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far , far away from him . 
The alliance with Prussia , Austria 's treachery , Bonaparte 's new triumph , tomorrow 's levee and parade , and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts . 
He closed his eyes , and immediately a sound of cannonading , of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears , and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill , the French were firing , and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around , and he experienced tenfold the joy of living , as he had not done since childhood . 
He woke up ... `` Yes , that all happened ! '' 
he said , and , smiling happily to himself like a child , he fell into a deep , youthful slumber . 
Next day he woke late . 
Recalling his recent impressions , the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis ; he remembered the Minister of War , the polite Austrian adjutant , Bilibin , and last night 's conversation .
