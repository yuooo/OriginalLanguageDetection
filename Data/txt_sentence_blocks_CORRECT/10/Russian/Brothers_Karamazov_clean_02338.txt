Would anyone venture to give her the sacred name of mother ? 
Let us be bold , gentlemen , let us be audacious even : it 's our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovsky 's play , who are scared at the sound of certain words . 
No , let us prove that the progress of the last few years has touched even us , and let us say plainly , the father is not merely he who begets the child , but he who begets it and does his duty by it . 
`` Oh , of course , there is the other meaning , there is the other interpretation of the word ` father , ' which insists that any father , even though he be a monster , even though he be the enemy of his children , still remains my father simply because he begot me . 
But this is , so to say , the mystical meaning which I can not comprehend with my intellect , but can only accept by faith , or , better to say , on faith , like many other things which I do not understand , but which religion bids me believe . 
But in that case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life . 
In the sphere of actual life , which has , indeed , its own rights , but also lays upon us great duties and obligations , in that sphere , if we want to be humane - Christian , in fact - we must , or ought to , act only upon convictions justified by reason and experience , which have been passed through the crucible of analysis ; in a word , we must act rationally , and not as though in dream and delirium , that we may not do harm , that we may not ill-treat and ruin a man . 
Then it will be real Christian work , not only mystic , but rational and philanthropic ... '' There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court , but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him finish without interruption . 
The court relapsed into silence at once . 
The orator went on .
