`` I 'll be back directly , I have forgotten my purse . '' 
And I ran back alone , to Afanasy 's little room . 
`` Afanasy , '' I said , `` I gave you two blows on the face yesterday , forgive me , '' I said . 
He started as though he were frightened , and looked at me ; and I saw that it was not enough , and on the spot , in my full officer 's uniform , I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground . 
`` Forgive me , '' I said . 
Then he was completely aghast . 
`` Your honour ... sir , what are you doing ? 
Am I worth it ? '' 
And he burst out crying as I had done before , hid his face in his hands , turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs . 
I flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage .
