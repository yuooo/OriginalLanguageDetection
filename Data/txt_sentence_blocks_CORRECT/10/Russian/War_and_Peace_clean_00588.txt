Into the insignificant , trifling , and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another . 
And this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter . 
Jests fell flat , news was not interesting , and the animation was evidently forced .

Pierre felt that he was the center of it all , and this both pleased and embarrassed him . 
He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation . 
He did not see , hear , or understand anything clearly . 
Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind . 
`` So it is all finished ! ''
