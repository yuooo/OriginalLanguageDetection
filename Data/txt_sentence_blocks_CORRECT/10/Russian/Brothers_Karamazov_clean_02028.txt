` Where is she ? ' 
he fairly gasped , but could n't believe it . 
` She 's standing there , ' said I. ` Open . ' 
He looked out of the window at me , half believing and half distrustful , but afraid to open . 
` Why , he is afraid of me now , ' I thought . 
And it was funny . 
I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we 'd agreed upon as a signal that Grushenka had come , in his presence , before his eyes . 
He did n't seem to believe my word , but as soon as he heard the taps , he ran at once to open the door . 
He opened it . 
I would have gone in , but he stood in the way to prevent me passing .
