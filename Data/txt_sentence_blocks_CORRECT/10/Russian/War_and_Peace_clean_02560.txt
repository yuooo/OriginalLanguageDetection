`` What force ! 
What a style ! '' 
was uttered in approval both of reader and of author . 
Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna 's guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days . 
`` You will see , '' said Anna Pavlovna , `` that tomorrow , on the Emperor 's birthday , we shall receive news . 
I have a favorable presentiment ! '' 
Anna Pavlovna 's presentiment was in fact fulfilled . 
Next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor 's birthday , Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from Prince Kutuzov . 
It was Kutuzov 's report , written from Tatarinova on the day of the battle . 
Kutuzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a step , that the French losses were much heavier than ours , and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information .
