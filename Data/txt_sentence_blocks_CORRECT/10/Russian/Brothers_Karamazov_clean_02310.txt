Why , why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov , given so genuinely and sincerely , so spontaneously and convincingly ? 
And why , on the contrary , does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice , in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho ? 
`` The same evening , after his talk with his brother , the prisoner wrote that fatal letter , and that letter is the chief , the most stupendous proof of the prisoner having committed robbery ! ' 
I shall beg from everyone , and if I do n't get it I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as Ivan has gone . ' 
A full programme of the murder , we are told , so it must have been he . 
` It has all been done as he wrote , ' cries the prosecutor . 
`` But in the first place , it 's the letter of a drunken man and written in great irritation ; secondly , he writes of the envelope from what he has heard from Smerdyakov again , for he has not seen the envelope himself ; and thirdly , he wrote it indeed , but how can you prove that he did it ? 
Did the prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow , did he find the money , did that money exist indeed ? 
And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off , if you remember ? 
He ran off post-haste not to steal , but to find out where she was , the woman who had crushed him .
