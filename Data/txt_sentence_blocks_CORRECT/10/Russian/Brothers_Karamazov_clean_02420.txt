he muttered anxiously . 
One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to someone to hold for a time . 
But he would not do this and seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers , as though they wanted to take them from him altogether . 
And after looking at the grave , and as it were , satisfying himself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled , he suddenly , to the surprise of everyone , turned , quite composedly even , and made his way homewards . 
But his steps became more and more hurried , he almost ran . 
The boys and Alyosha kept up with him . 
`` The flowers are for mamma , the flowers are for mamma ! 
I was unkind to mamma , '' he began exclaiming suddenly . 
Someone called to him to put on his hat as it was cold . 
But he flung the hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating , `` I wo n't have the hat , I wo n't have the hat . ''
