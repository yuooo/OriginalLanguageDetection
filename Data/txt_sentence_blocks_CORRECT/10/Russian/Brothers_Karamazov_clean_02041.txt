`` You used to say yourself that everything was lawful , so now why are you so upset , too ? 
You even want to go and give evidence against yourself ... . 
Only there 'll be nothing of the sort ! 
You wo n't go to give evidence , '' Smerdyakov decided with conviction . 
`` You 'll see , '' said Ivan . 
`` It is n't possible . 
You are very clever . 
You are fond of money , I know that . 
You like to be respected , too , for you 're very proud ; you are far too fond of female charms , too , and you mind most of all about living in undisturbed comfort , without having to depend on anyone - that 's what you care most about . 
You wo n't want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself .
