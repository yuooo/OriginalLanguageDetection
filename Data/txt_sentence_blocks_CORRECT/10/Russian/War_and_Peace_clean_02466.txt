`` Board them ! '' 
yelled the tipsy man , trying to press the trigger . 
Hearing the yell the officer turned round , and at the same moment Pierre threw himself on the drunkard . 
Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger , there was a deafening report , and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke . 
The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door . 
Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French , Pierre , snatching away the pistol and throwing it down , ran up to the officer and addressed him in French . 
`` You are not wounded ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I think not , '' answered the Frenchman , feeling himself over . 
`` But I have had a lucky escape this time , '' he added , pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall .
