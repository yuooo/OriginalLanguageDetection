But you do n't understand it . '' 
`` Oh , yes , I quite understand , '' answered Rostov , who was under his new friend 's influence . 
In the autumn the Rostovs returned to Moscow . 
Early in the winter Denisov also came back and stayed with them . 
The first half of the winter of 1806 , which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow , was one of the happiest , merriest times for him and the whole family . 
Nicholas brought many young men to his parents ' house . 
Vera was a handsome girl of twenty ; Sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower ; Natasha , half grown up and half child , was now childishly amusing , now girlishly enchanting . 
At that time in the Rostovs ' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming girls . 
Every young man who came to the house -- seeing those impressionable , smiling young faces -LRB- smiling probably at their own happiness -RRB- , feeling the eager bustle around him , and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of hope - experienced the same feeling ; sharing with the young folk of the Rostovs ' household a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness . 
Among the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first was Dolokhov , whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha .
