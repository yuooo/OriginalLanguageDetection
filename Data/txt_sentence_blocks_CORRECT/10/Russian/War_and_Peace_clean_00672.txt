That day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris , telling him that the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him . 
Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops , after their active service , were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares . 
The Pavlograds held feast after feast , celebrating awards they had received for the campaign , and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian , who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses . 
Rostov , who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisov 's horse , Bedouin , was in debt all round , to his comrades and the sutlers . 
On receiving Boris ' letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz , dined there , drank a bottle of wine , and then set off alone to the Guards ' camp to find his old playmate . 
Rostov had not yet had time to get his uniform . 
He had on a shabby cadet jacket , decorated with a soldier 's cross , equally shabby cadet 's riding breeches lined with worn leather , and an officer 's saber with a sword knot . 
The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign , and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head . 
As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance -- that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire . 
The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip , parading their cleanliness and discipline .
