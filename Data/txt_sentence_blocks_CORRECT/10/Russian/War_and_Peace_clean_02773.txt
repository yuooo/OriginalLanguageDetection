And the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd . 
For the French retreating along the old Smolensk road , the final goal -- their native land -- was too remote , and their immediate goal was Smolensk , toward which all their desires and hopes , enormously intensified in the mass , urged them on . 
It was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk , nor that they were told so -LRB- on the contrary their superior officers , and Napoleon himself , knew that provisions were scarce there -RRB- , but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations . 
So both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves , and pushed on to Smolensk as to a promised land . 
Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on . 
Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy , there was another cause binding them together -- their great numbers . 
As with the physical law of gravity , their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself . 
In their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation . 
Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery ; but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to Smolensk , their goal , drew each of them in the same direction ; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company , and though the French availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext , such pretexts did not always occur . 
Their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement , to which the French were directing all their energies .
