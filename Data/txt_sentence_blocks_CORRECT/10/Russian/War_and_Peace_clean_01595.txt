But in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in Marya Dmitrievna 's broad , stern face , which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity . 
After Mass , when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture , a servant announced that the carriage was ready , and Marya Dmitrievna rose with a stern air . 
She wore her holiday shawl , in which she paid calls , and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkonski to have an explanation with him about Natasha . 
After she had gone , a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on the Rostovs , and Natasha , very glad of this diversion , having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room , occupied herself trying on the new dresses . 
Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together , and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted , she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father 's voice and another 's -- a woman 's - that made her flush . 
It was Helene . 
Natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and Countess Bezukhova , dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar , came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles . 
`` Oh , my enchantress ! '' 
she cried to the blushing Natasha . 
`` Charming !
