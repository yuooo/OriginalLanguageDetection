I may remark that many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment . 
She spoke softly but clearly , so that she was heard all over the court . 
She expressed herself with composure , or at least tried to appear composed . 
The President began his examination discreetly and very respectfully , as though afraid to touch on `` certain chords , '' and showing consideration for her great unhappiness . 
But in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner , `` until he left me of his own accord ... '' she added quietly . 
When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations , she said firmly , `` I did n't give him the money simply to send it off . 
I felt at the time that he was in great need of money ... . 
I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to . 
There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards . '' 
I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail .
