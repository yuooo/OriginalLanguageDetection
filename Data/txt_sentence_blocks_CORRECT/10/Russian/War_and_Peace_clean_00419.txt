There was no one to hew down -LRB- as he had always imagined battles to himself -RRB- , nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers . 
He stood looking about him , when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt , and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan . 
Rostov ran up to him with the others . 
Again someone shouted , `` Stretchers ! '' 
Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him . 
`` Oooh ! 
For Christ 's sake let me alone ! '' 
cried the wounded man , but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher . 
Nicholas Rostov turned away and , as if searching for something , gazed into the distance , at the waters of the Danube , at the sky , and at the sun . 
How beautiful the sky looked ; how blue , how calm , and how deep !
