`` I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not come and brought his pupil with him '' -LRB- for some reason Prince Bolkonski referred to Anatole as a `` pupil '' -RRB- `` for the sake of my beautiful eyes . 
Last night a proposition was made me on your account and , as you know my principles , I refer it to you . '' 
`` How am I to understand you , mon pere ? '' 
said the princess , growing pale and then blushing . 
`` How understand me ! '' 
cried her father angrily . 
`` Prince Vasili finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil 's behalf . 
That 's how it 's to be understood ! 
` How understand it ' ! 
... And I ask you ! ''
