A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove . 
A board was found , fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth , a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum , and having asked Mary Hendrikhovna to preside , they all crowded round her . 
One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands , another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp , another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft , and yet another waved the flies off her husband 's face , lest he should wake up . 
`` Leave him alone , '' said Mary Hendrikhovna , smiling timidly and happily . 
`` He is sleeping well as it is , after a sleepless night . '' 
`` Oh , no , Mary Hendrikhovna , '' replied the officer , `` one must look after the doctor . 
Perhaps he 'll take pity on me someday , when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me . '' 
There were only three tumblers , the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak , and the samovar held only six tumblers of water , but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive one 's tumbler from Mary Hendrikhovna 's plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails . 
All the officers appeared to be , and really were , in love with her that evening . 
Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar , yielding to the general mood of courting Mary Hendrikhovna .
