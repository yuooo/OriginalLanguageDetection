`` But , devil take you , I have n't slept because of you ! 
Well , thank God . 
Now lie down . 
We can still get a nap before morning . '' 
`` But ... no , '' said Petya , `` I do n't want to sleep yet . 
Besides I know myself , if I fall asleep it 's finished . 
And then I am used to not sleeping before a battle . '' 
He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day . 
Then , noticing that Denisov was asleep , he rose and went out of doors .
