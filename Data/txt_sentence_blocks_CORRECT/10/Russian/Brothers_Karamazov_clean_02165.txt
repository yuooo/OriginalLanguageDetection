He went on , passing his hand before his eyes , `` Oh , yes , spazieren . '' 
* * Promenading . 
`` Wandering ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , wandering , that 's what I say . 
Well , his wits went wandering and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself . 
And yet he was a grateful and sensitive boy . 
Oh , I remember him very well , a little chap so high , left neglected by his father in the back yard , when he ran about without boots on his feet , and his little breeches hanging by one button . '' 
A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man 's voice .
