`` And you do n't even suspect him ? '' 
`` Why , do you suspect him ? '' 
`` He is suspected , too . '' 
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor . 
`` Joking apart , '' he brought out gloomily . 
`` Listen . 
From the very beginning , almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain , I 've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind . 
I 've been sitting here , shouting that I 'm innocent and thinking all the time ` Smerdyakov ! ' 
I ca n't get Smerdyakov out of my head .
