`` It 's lucky for him that he escaped me ; but I 'll find him ! '' 
she said in her rough voice . 
`` Do you hear what I am saying or not ? '' 
she added . 
She put her large hand under Natasha 's face and turned it toward her .

Her eyes were dry and glistening , her lips compressed , her cheeks sunken . 
`` Let me be ! 
... What is it to me ? 
... I shall die ! ''
