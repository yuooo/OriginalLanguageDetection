`` What is your conception of Freemasonry ? '' 
`` I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims , '' said Pierre , feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment , as he spoke . 
`` I imagine ... '' `` Good ! '' 
said the Rhetor quickly , apparently satisfied with this answer .
