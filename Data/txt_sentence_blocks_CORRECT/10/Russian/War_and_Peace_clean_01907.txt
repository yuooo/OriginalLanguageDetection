`` Just what I think , Yakov Alpatych . 
What I say is : orders have been given not to let them in , so that must be right . 
And the peasants are asking three rubles for carting -- it is n't Christian ! '' 
Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding . 
He asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses , and when he had had his tea he went to bed . 
All night long troops were moving past the inn . 
Next morning Alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business . 
It was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already hot . 
`` A good day for harvesting , '' thought Alpatych . 
From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning .
