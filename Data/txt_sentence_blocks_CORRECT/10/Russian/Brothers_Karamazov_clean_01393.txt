He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital fact , that is , that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for Grushenka , he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar , and that when he returned , the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with blood . 
`` And the blood was simply flowing , dripping from him , dripping ! '' 
Fenya kept exclaiming . 
This horrible detail was simply the product of her disordered imagination . 
But although not `` dripping , '' Pyotr Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood , and had helped to wash them . 
Moreover , the question he had to decide was , not how soon the blood had dried , but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle , or rather , whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's , and how he could satisfactorily ascertain . 
Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point , and though he found out nothing conclusive , yet he carried away a conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his father 's house , and that , therefore , something must have happened there . 
`` And when he came back , '' Fenya added with excitement . 
`` I told him the whole story , and then I began asking him , ` Why have you got blood on your hands , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? ' 
and he answered that that was human blood , and that he had just killed someone .
