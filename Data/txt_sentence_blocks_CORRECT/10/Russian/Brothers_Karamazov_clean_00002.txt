Indeed , if this precipice , a chosen and favourite spot of hers , had been less picturesque , if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place , most likely the suicide would never have taken place . 
This is a fact , and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three generations . 
Adelaida Ivanovna Miusov 's action was similarly , no doubt , an echo of other people 's ideas , and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom . 
She wanted , perhaps , to show her feminine independence , to override class distinctions and the despotism of her family . 
And a pliable imagination persuaded her , we must suppose , for a brief moment , that Fyodor Pavlovitch , in spite of his parasitic position , was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch , though he was , in fact , an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more . 
What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement , and this greatly captivated Adelaida Ivanovna 's fancy . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch 's position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise , for he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another . 
To attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect . 
As for mutual love it did not exist apparently , either in the bride or in him , in spite of Adelaida Ivanovna 's beauty . 
This was , perhaps , a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch , who was always of a voluptuous temper , and ready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement .
