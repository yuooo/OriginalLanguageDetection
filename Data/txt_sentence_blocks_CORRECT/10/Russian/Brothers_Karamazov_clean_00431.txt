Both Together ALYOSHA left his father 's house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it . 
His mind too seemed shattered and unhinged , while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonising and conflicting experiences of the day . 
He felt something bordering upon despair , which he had never known till then . 
Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal , insoluble question : How would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman ? 
Now he had himself been a witness of it , he had been present and seen them face to face . 
Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy , terribly , completely unhappy : there was trouble awaiting him . 
It appeared too that there were other people concerned , far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before . 
There was something positively mysterious in it , too . 
Ivan had made a step towards him , which was what Alyosha had been long desiring . 
Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it .
