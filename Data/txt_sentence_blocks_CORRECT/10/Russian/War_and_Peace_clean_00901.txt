`` Separate ?

`` Separate !

Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her . 
`` I 'll kill you ! '' 
he shouted , and seizing the marble top of a table with a strength he had never before felt , he made a step toward her brandishing the slab . 
Helene 's face became terrible , she shrieked and sprang aside . 
His father 's nature showed itself in Pierre .
