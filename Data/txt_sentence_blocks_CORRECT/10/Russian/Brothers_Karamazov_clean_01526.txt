... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night ! 
... And should I have been like this on this night , and at this moment , sitting with you , could I have talked like this , could I have moved like this , could I have looked at you and at the world like this , if I had really been the murderer of my father , when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night - not from fear - oh , not simply from fear of your punishment ! 
The disgrace of it ! 
And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you , who see nothing and believe in nothing , blind moles and scoffers , and to tell you another nasty thing I 've done , another disgrace , even if that would save me from your accusation ! 
No , better Siberia ! 
The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door , he killed him , he robbed him .
