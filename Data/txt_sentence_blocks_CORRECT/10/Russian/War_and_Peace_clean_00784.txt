groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around ... `` Bolkonski ! '' 
he whispered , his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age , `` Bolkonski ! '' 
he whispered , pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy , `` what 's that ? '' 
But before he had finished speaking , Prince Andrew , feeling tears of shame and anger choking him , had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard . 
`` Forward , lads ! '' 
he shouted in a voice piercing as a child 's . 
`` Here it is ! '' 
thought he , seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him . 
Several soldiers fell . 
`` Hurrah ! ''
