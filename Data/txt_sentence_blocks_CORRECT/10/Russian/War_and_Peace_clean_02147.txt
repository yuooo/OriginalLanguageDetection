Donning his court uniform , M. de Beausset ordered a box he had brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of Napoleon 's tent , where he began opening the box while conversing with Napoleon 's aides-de-camp who surrounded him . 
Fabvier , not entering the tent , remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance . 
The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet . 
Slightly snorting and grunting , he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down . 
Another valet , with his finger over the mouth of a bottle , was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor 's pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled . 
Napoleon 's short hair was wet and matted on the forehead , but his face , though puffy and yellow , expressed physical satisfaction . 
`` Go on , harder , go on ! '' 
he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him , slightly twitching and grunting . 
An aide-de-camp , who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday 's action , was standing by the door after delivering his message , awaiting permission to withdraw . 
Napoleon , frowning , looked at him from under his brows .
