The locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army . 
His own strategic plan , which obviously could not now be carried out , was forgotten . 
Now , entering into Weyrother 's plan , Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision . 
To the left down below in the mist , the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard . 
It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would concentrate . 
`` There we shall encounter difficulties , and there , '' thought he , `` I shall be sent with a brigade or division , and there , standard in hand , I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me . '' 
He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions . 
Seeing them he kept thinking , `` That may be the very standard with which I shall lead the army . '' 
In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew , but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white sea . 
Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing .
