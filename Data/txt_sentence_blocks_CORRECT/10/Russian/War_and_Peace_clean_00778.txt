Kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers . 
When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary , deserted house that had probably once been an inn , where two roads parted . 
Both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both . 
The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights . 
Down below , on the left , the firing became more distinct . 
Kutuzov had stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general . 
Prince Andrew , who was a little behind looking at them , turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass . 
`` Look , look ! '' 
said this adjutant , looking not at the troops in the distance , but down the hill before him . 
`` It 's the French ! ''
