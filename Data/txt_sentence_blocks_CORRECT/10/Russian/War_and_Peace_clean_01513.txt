She saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men , possible suitors , who sometimes appeared at their house . 
She had no friends : during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne , with whom she had never been able to be quite frank , had now become unpleasant to her , and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her . 
Julie , with whom she had corresponded for the last five years , was in Moscow , but proved to be quite alien to her when they met . 
Just then Julie , who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow , was in the full whirl of society pleasures . 
She was surrounded by young men who , she fancied , had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth . 
Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never . 
On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to , since Julie -- whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week . 
Like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years , she regretted Julie 's presence and having no one to write to .
