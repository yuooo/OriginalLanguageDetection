`` You are all happy now , '' he felt , `` so here 's something to make you happier ! '' 
He was perfectly enchanted himself . 
`` I 've been coveting this thing for a long while ; it 's for you , old man , it 's for you . 
It belonged to Morozov , it was no use to him , he had it from his brother . 
I swopped a book from father 's book-case for it , A Kinsman of Mahomet , or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago , before they had any censorship . 
And Morozov has a taste for such things . 
He was grateful to me , too ... '' Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it . 
Ilusha raised himself , and , with his right arm still round the dog , he gazed enchanted at the toy . 
The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too , and that it could be fired off at once `` if it wo n't alarm the ladies . '' 
`` Mamma '' immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted .
