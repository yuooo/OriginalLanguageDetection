Count Arakcheev 's anteroom had quite a special character . 
The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility ; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness , covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves , their situation , and the person for whom they were waiting . 
Some walked thoughtfully up and down , others whispered and laughed . 
Prince Andrew heard the nickname `` Sila Andreevich '' and the words , `` Uncle will give it to us hot , '' in reference to Count Arakcheev . 
One general -LRB- an important personage -RRB- , evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long , sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself . 
But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces -- that of fear . 
Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name , but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course . 
After some others had been shown in and out of the minister 's room by the adjutant on duty , an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door . 
This officer 's audience lasted a long time . 
Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door , and the officer -- with pale face and trembling lips -- came out and passed through the waiting room , clutching his head .
