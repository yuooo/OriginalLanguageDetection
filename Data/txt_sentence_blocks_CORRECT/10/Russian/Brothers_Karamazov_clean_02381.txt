Katya said , with bitter reproach , and she burst into tears . 
`` Then you will come , '' said Alyosha firmly , seeing her tears . 
`` I 'll go and tell him you will come directly . '' 
`` No , do n't tell him so on any account , '' cried Katya in alarm . 
`` I will come , but do n't tell him beforehand , for perhaps I may go , but not go in ... I do n't know yet - '' Her voice failed her . 
She gasped for breath . 
Alyosha got up to go . 
`` And what if I meet anyone ? '' 
she said suddenly , in a low voice , turning white again .
