I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect , for I was so much more impressionable than my companions . 
By the time we left the school as officers , we were ready to lay down our lives for the honour of the regiment , but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of honour , and if anyone had known it , he would have been the first to ridicule it . 
Drunkenness , debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves on . 
I do n't say that we were bad by nature , all these young men were good fellows , but they behaved badly , and I worst of all . 
What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money , and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure , and plunged headlong into all the recklessness of youth . 
I was fond of reading , yet strange to say , the Bible was the one book I never opened at that time , though I always carried it about with me , and I was never separated from it ; in very truth I was keeping that book `` for the day and the hour , for the month and the year , '' though I knew it not . 
After four years of this life , I chanced to be in the town of K. where our regiment was stationed at the time . 
We found the people of the town hospitable , rich , and fond of entertainments . 
I met with a cordial reception everywhere , as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off , which always goes a long way in the world . 
And then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all .
