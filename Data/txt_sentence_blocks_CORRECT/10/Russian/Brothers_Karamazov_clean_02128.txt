In brief , there was a great deal of talk . 
I know for a fact that there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya 's account in our town . 
Many ladies quarrelled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion about the dreadful case , and it was that the husbands of these ladies , far from being favourably disposed to the prisoner , should enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him . 
In fact , one may say pretty certainly that the masculine , as distinguished from the feminine , part of the audience was biased against the prisoner . 
There were numbers of severe , frowning , even vindictive faces . 
Mitya , indeed , had managed to offend many people during his stay in the town . 
Some of the visitors were , of course , in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of Mitya personally . 
But all were interested in the trial , and the majority of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal , except perhaps the lawyers , who were more interested in the legal than in the moral aspect of the case . 
Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer , Fetyukovitch . 
His talent was well known , and this was not the first time he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces .
