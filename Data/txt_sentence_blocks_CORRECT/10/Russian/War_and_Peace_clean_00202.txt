The princess , holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands , looked attentively into Prince Vasili 's eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence , if she had to wait till morning . 
`` Well , you see , my dear princess and cousin , Catherine Semenovna , '' continued Prince Vasili , returning to his theme , apparently not without an inner struggle ; `` at such a moment as this one must think of everything . 
One must think of the future , of all of you ... I love you all , like children of my own , as you know . '' 
The princess continued to look at him without moving , and with the same dull expression . 
`` And then of course my family has also to be considered , '' Prince Vasili went on , testily pushing away a little table without looking at her . 
`` You know , Catiche , that we -- you three sisters , Mamontov , and my wife -- are the count 's only direct heirs . 
I know , I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters . 
It is no easier for me ; but , my dear , I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything . 
Do you know I have sent for Pierre ? 
The count , '' pointing to his portrait , `` definitely demanded that he should be called . ''
