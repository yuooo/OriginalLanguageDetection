But in my soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud ... . 
You do n't agree , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Why ` fraud ' ? '' 
Alyosha smiled again . 
`` Well , all the classical authors have been translated into all languages , so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin , but solely as a police measure , to stupefy the intelligence . 
So what can one call it but a fraud ? '' 
`` Why , who taught you all this ? '' 
cried Alyosha , surprised at last . 
`` In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being taught . 
Besides , what I said just now about the classics being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class . ''
