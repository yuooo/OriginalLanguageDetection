The walls were gay with blue paper , which was a good deal used however , and in the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers , so that there was a continual rustling from them . 
The furniture was very scanty : two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table . 
The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it . 
There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little windows . 
In the corner there was a case of ikons . 
On the table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it , and a tray with two cups . 
But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out . 
He was sitting at the table on a bench . 
He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen . 
There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick , but with a composite candle .
