Only Natasha and the countess remained in the room . 
Petya was no longer with the family , he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Troitsa . 
The countess , on hearing that Moscow was on fire , began to cry . 
Natasha , pale , with a fixed look , was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father 's words . 
She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant , three houses off . 
`` Oh , how terrible , '' said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened . 
`` I believe the whole of Moscow will burn , there 's an awful glow ! 
Natasha , do look ! 
You can see it from the window , '' she said to her cousin , evidently wishing to distract her mind . 
But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove .
