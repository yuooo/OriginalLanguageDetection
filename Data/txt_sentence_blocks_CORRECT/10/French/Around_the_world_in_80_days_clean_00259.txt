Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . '' 
Passepartout rushed out of the car . 
Thirty or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor . 
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way . 
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man , whom the station-master at Medicine Bow , the next stopping place , had sent on before . 
The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion , in which Colonel Proctor , with his insolent manner , was conspicuous . 
Passepartout , joining the group , heard the signal-man say , `` No ! 
you ca n't pass . 
The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky , and would not bear the weight of the train . '' 
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were .
