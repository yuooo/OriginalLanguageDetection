La Valliere , that timid , gentle lamb , turned round upon him , and with a glance like lightning imposed silence upon him . 
`` Monsieur , '' she said , `` when the king acts well , whether , in doing so , he does either myself or those who belong to me an injury , I have nothing to say ; but were the king to confer a benefit either upon me or mine , and if he acted badly , I should tell him so . '' 
`` But it appears to me , mademoiselle , '' Colbert ventured to say , `` that I too love the king . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , we both love him , but each in a different manner , '' replied La Valliere , with such an accent that the heart of the young king was powerfully affected by it . 
`` I love him so deeply , that the whole world is aware of it ; so purely , that the king himself does not doubt my affection . 
He is my king and my master ; I am the least of all his servants . 
But whoso touches his honor assails my life . 
Therefore , I repeat , that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet under his own roof . '' 
Colbert hung down his head , for he felt that the king had abandoned him . 
However , as he bent his head , he murmured , `` Mademoiselle , I have only one word to say . ''
