what can we be going to hear - and what can result from this intimacy ? '' 
`` Nothing good for M. Fouquet , at all events . '' 
The prince did not deceive himself . 
We have seen that Louis XIV . 
had sent for Colbert , and Colbert had arrived . 
The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done ; it was true the king was alone with his subject . 
`` Colbert , '' said he , `` sit down . '' 
The intendant , overcome with delight , for he feared he was about to be dismissed , refused this unprecedented honor . 
`` Does he accept ? ''
