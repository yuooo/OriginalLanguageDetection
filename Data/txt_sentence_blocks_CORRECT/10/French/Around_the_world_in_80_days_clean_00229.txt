Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together , and not met on the steamer ! 
At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to Europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company . 
Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his ; and the detective -- who was determined not to lose sight of him -- begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco -- a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted . 
They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street , where a great crowd was collected ; the side-walks , street , horsecar rails , the shop-doors , the windows of the houses , and even the roofs , were full of people . 
Men were going about carrying large posters , and flags and streamers were floating in the wind ; while loud cries were heard on every hand . 
`` Hurrah for Camerfield ! '' 
`` Hurrah for Mandiboy ! '' 
It was a political meeting ; at least so Fix conjectured , who said to Mr. Fogg , `` Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd . 
There may be danger in it . '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Mr. Fogg ; `` and blows , even if they are political are still blows . ''
