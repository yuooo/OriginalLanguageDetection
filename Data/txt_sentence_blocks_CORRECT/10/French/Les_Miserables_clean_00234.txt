He was there but just now , he was one of the crew , he went and came along the deck with the rest , he had his part of breath and of sunlight , he was a living man . 
Now , what has taken place ? 
He has slipped , he has fallen ; all is at an end . 
He is in the tremendous sea . 
Under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles . 
The billows , torn and lashed by the wind , encompass him hideously ; the tossings of the abyss bear him away ; all the tongues of water dash over his head ; a populace of waves spits upon him ; confused openings half devour him ; every time that he sinks , he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night ; frightful and unknown vegetations seize him , knot about his feet , draw him to them ; he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss , that he forms part of the foam ; the waves toss him from one to another ; he drinks in the bitterness ; the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously , to drown him ; the enormity plays with his agony . 
It seems as though all that water were hate . 
Nevertheless , he struggles . 
He tries to defend himself ; he tries to sustain himself ; he makes an effort ; he swims . 
He , his petty strength all exhausted instantly , combats the inexhaustible .
