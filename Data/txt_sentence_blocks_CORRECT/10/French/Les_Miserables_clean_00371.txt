She was still young ; she was barely thirty . 
If this crouching woman had stood upright , her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs , might have frightened the traveller at the outset , troubled her confidence , and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish . 
A person who is seated instead of standing erect -- destinies hang upon such a thing as that . 
The traveller told her story , with slight modifications . 
That she was a working-woman ; that her husband was dead ; that her work in Paris had failed her , and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere , in her own native parts ; that she had left Paris that morning on foot ; that , as she was carrying her child , and felt fatigued , she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it ; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot ; that the little one had walked a little , but not much , because she was so young , and that she had been obliged to take her up , and the jewel had fallen asleep . 
At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss , which woke her . 
The child opened her eyes , great blue eyes like her mother 's , and looked at -- what ? 
Nothing ; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children , which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue . 
One would say that they feel themselves to be angels , and that they know us to be men . 
Then the child began to laugh ; and although the mother held fast to her , she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run .
