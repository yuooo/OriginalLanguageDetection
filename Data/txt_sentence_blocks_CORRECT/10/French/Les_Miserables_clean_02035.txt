Sleep yourself sober from your absinthe . '' 
`` You are an ingrate , Enjolras . '' 
`` You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine ! 
You capable of it ! '' 
`` I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres , of crossing the Place Saint-Michel , of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , of taking the Rue de Vaugirard , of passing the Carmelites , of turning into the Rue d'Assas , of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi , of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre , of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries , of striding across the boulevard , of following the Chaussee du Maine , of passing the barrier , and entering Richefeu 's . 
I am capable of that . 
My shoes are capable of that . '' 
`` Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu 's ? '' 
`` Not much . 
We only address each other as thou . ''
