And then , on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors , he had been only a child , now he was a man . 
He felt it . 
Misery , we repeat , had been good for him . 
Poverty in youth , when it succeeds , has this magnificent property about it , that it turns the whole will towards effort , and the whole soul towards aspiration . 
Poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous ; hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life . 
The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions , horse races , hunting , dogs , tobacco , gaming , good repasts , and all the rest of it ; occupations for the baser side of the soul , at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides . 
The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty ; he eats ; when he has eaten , he has nothing more but meditation . 
He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis ; he gazes at the sky , space , the stars , flowers , children , the humanity among which he is suffering , the creation amid which he beams . 
He gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul , he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God . 
He dreams , he feels himself great ; he dreams on , and feels himself tender .
