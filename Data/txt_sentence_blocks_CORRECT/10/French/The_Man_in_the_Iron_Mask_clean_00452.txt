As for the governor they did not even dare disturb him . 
Fouquet sat in his carriage , at the outer gate of the fortress , chafing with rage and impatience , awaiting the return of the officers , who at last re-appeared with a sufficiently sulky air . 
`` Well , '' said Fouquet , impatiently , `` what did the major say ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur , '' replied the soldier , `` the major laughed in my face . 
He told me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux , and that even were he at Paris , M. Fouquet would not get up at so early an hour as the present . '' 
`` Mordieu ! 
you are an absolute set of fools , '' cried the minister , darting out of the carriage ; and before the subaltern had time to shut the gate , Fouquet sprang through it , and ran forward in spite of the soldier , who cried out for assistance . 
Fouquet gained ground , regardless of the cries of the man , who , however , having at last come up with Fouquet , called out to the sentinel of the second gate , `` Look out , look out , sentinel ! '' 
The man crossed his pike before the minister ; but the latter , robust and active , and hurried away , too , by his passion , wrested the pike from the soldier and struck him a violent blow on the shoulder with it . 
The subaltern , who approached too closely , received a share of the blows as well .
