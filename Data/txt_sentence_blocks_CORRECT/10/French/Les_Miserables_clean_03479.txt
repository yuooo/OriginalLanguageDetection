You shall eat my strawberries . 
I water them myself . 
And no more ` madame , ' no more ` Monsieur Jean , ' we are living under a Republic , everybody says thou , do n't they , Marius ? 
The programme is changed . 
If you only knew , father , I have had a sorrow , there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall , and a horrible cat ate her . 
My poor , pretty , little robin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me ! 
I cried over it . 
I should have liked to kill the cat . 
But now nobody cries any more . 
Everybody laughs , everybody is happy .
