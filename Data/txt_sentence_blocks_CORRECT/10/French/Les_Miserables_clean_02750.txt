Gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark . 
Jean Valjean began again : -- `` Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent ? '' 
`` There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called brioches -LSB- blunders -RSB- . 
This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , and I 'm going back there . 
Good evening , citizen . '' 
That said , Gavroche took himself off , or , to describe it more exactly , fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird . 
He plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it , with the rigid rapidity of a projectile ; the alley of l'Homme Arme became silent and solitary once more ; in a twinkling , that strange child , who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream , had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses , and was lost there , like smoke in the dark ; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished , had there not taken place , a few minutes after his disappearance , a startling shiver of glass , and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois . 
It was Gavroche upon his way through the Rue du Chaume . 
WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius ' letter . 
He groped his way up the stairs , as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey , opened and shut his door softly , listened to see whether he could hear any noise , -- made sure that , to all appearances , Cosette and Toussaint were asleep , and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark , so greatly did his hand tremble .
