`` But prove it ! '' 
Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper , which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes . 
`` I have my papers , '' he said calmly . 
And he added : `` Monsieur le Baron , in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean thoroughly . 
I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the same man , and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert . 
If I speak , it is because I have proofs . 
Not manuscript proofs -- writing is suspicious , handwriting is complaisant , -- but printed proofs . '' 
As he spoke , Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers , yellow , faded , and strongly saturated with tobacco . 
One of these two newspapers , broken at every fold and falling into rags , seemed much older than the other . 
`` Two facts , two proofs , '' remarked Thenardier .
