The reader will recall Marius ' hesitations , his palpitations , his terrors . 
He remained on his bench and did not approach . 
This vexed Cosette . 
One day , she said to Jean Valjean : `` Father , let us stroll about a little in that direction . '' 
Seeing that Marius did not come to her , she went to him . 
In such cases , all women resemble Mahomet . 
And then , strange to say , the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity ; in a young girl it is boldness . 
This is surprising , and yet nothing is more simple . 
It is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming , each the other 's qualities . 
That day , Cosette 's glance drove Marius beside himself , and Marius ' glance set Cosette to trembling .
