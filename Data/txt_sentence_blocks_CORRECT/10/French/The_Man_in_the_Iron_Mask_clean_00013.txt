said Aramis , with a slight uneasiness . 
`` Yes , '' said the young man , smiling . 
Aramis felt the chill of that smile , and shuddered . 
`` Oh , as you fear death , you know more about matters than you say , '' he cried . 
`` And you , '' returned the prisoner , `` who bade me to ask to see you ; you , who , when I did ask to see you , came here promising a world of confidence ; how is it that , nevertheless , it is you who are silent , leaving it for me to speak ? 
Since , then , we both wear masks , either let us both retain them or put them aside together . '' 
Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark , saying to himself , `` This is no ordinary man ; I must be cautious . 
- Are you ambitious ? '' 
said he suddenly to the prisoner , aloud , without preparing him for the alteration . 
`` What do you mean by ambitious ? ''
