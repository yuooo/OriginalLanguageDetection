`` Then , if you please , inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to speak to him for a moment . '' 
At the mention of the comte 's name , one of the young men , no doubt accustomed to hear it pronounced with respect , immediately went to inform Planchet . 
It was at this moment that Raoul , after his painful scene with Montalais and De Guiche , arrived at the grocer 's house . 
Planchet left his job directly he received the comte 's message . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte ! '' 
exclaimed he , `` how glad I am to see you ! 
What good star brings you here ? '' 
`` My dear Planchet , '' said Athos , pressing the hand of his son , whose sad look he silently observed , - `` we are come to learn of you - But in what confusion do I find you ! 
You are as white as a miller ; where have you been rummaging ? ''
