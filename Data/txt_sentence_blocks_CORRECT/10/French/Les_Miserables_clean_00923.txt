At a quarter-past four , that is to say , when night was fully come , he passed in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin , where The Two Convicts was being played that day . 
This poster , illuminated by the theatre lanterns , struck him ; for , although he was walking rapidly , he halted to read it . 
An instant later he was in the blind alley of La Planchette , and he entered the Plat d'Etain -LSB- the Pewter Platter -RSB- , where the office of the coach for Lagny was then situated . 
This coach set out at half-past four . 
The horses were harnessed , and the travellers , summoned by the coachman , were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle . 
The man inquired : -- `` Have you a place ? '' 
`` Only one -- beside me on the box , '' said the coachman . 
`` I will take it . '' 
`` Climb up . '' 
Nevertheless , before setting out , the coachman cast a glance at the traveller 's shabby dress , at the diminutive size of his bundle , and made him pay his fare .
