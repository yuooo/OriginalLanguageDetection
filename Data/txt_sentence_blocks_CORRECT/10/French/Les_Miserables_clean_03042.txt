He sank still deeper , he turned his face to the rear , to escape the water , and in order that he might be able to breathe ; anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows ; he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of Marius ; he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward ; his foot struck something solid ; a point of support . 
It was high time . 
He straightened himself up , and rooted himself upon that point of support with a sort of fury . 
This produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase leading back to life . 
The point of support , thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment , was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement , which had bent but had not given way , and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece . 
Well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness . 
This fragment of the vaulting , partly submerged , but solid , was a veritable inclined plane , and , once on this plane , he was safe . 
Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire . 
As he emerged from the water , he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees .
