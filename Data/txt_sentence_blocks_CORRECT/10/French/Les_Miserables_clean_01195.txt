This exists . 
It can be seen . 
It can be touched . 
These in pace , these dungeons , these iron hinges , these necklets , that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river 's current , that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb , with this difference , that the dead man here was a living being , that soil which is but mud , that vault hole , those oozing walls , -- what declaimers ! 
ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST Monasticism , such as it existed in Spain , and such as it still exists in Thibet , is a sort of phthisis for civilization . 
It stops life short . 
It simply depopulates . 
Claustration , castration . 
It has been the scourge of Europe . 
Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience , the forced vocations , feudalism bolstered up by the cloister , the right of the first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism , the ferocities of which we have just spoken , the in pace , the closed mouths , the walled-up brains , so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows , the taking of the habit , the interment of living souls .
