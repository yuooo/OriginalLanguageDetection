Both followed the same route ; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded . 
Fouquet had not yet perceived D'Artagnan . 
But on issuing from the slope , a single echo struck the air ; it was that of the steps of D'Artagnan 's horse , which rolled along like thunder . 
Fouquet turned round , and saw behind him , within a hundred paces , his enemy bent over the neck of his horse . 
There could be no doubt - the shining baldrick , the red cassock - it was a musketeer . 
Fouquet slackened his hand likewise , and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself . 
`` Oh , but , '' thought D'Artagnan , becoming very anxious , `` that is not a common horse M. Fouquet is upon - let us see ! '' 
And he attentively examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the courser . 
Round full quarters - a thin long tail - large hocks - thin legs , as dry as bars of steel - hoofs hard as marble . 
He spurred his own , but the distance between the two remained the same .
