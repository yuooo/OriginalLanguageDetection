His imagination penetrated the fields of Africa in the environs of Gigelli , where M. de Beaufort must have landed with his army . 
A waste of gray rocks , rendered green in certain parts by the waters of the sea , when it lashed the shore in storms and tempest . 
Beyond , the shore , strewed over with these rocks like gravestones , ascended , in form of an amphitheater among mastic-trees and cactus , a sort of small town , full of smoke , confused noises , and terrified movements . 
All of a sudden , from the bosom of this smoke arose a flame , which succeeded , creeping along the houses , in covering the entire surface of the town , and increased by degrees , uniting in its red and angry vortices tears , screams , and supplicating arms outstretched to Heaven . 
There was , for a moment , a frightful pele-mele of timbers falling to pieces , of swords broken , of stones calcined , trees burnt and disappearing . 
It was a strange thing that in this chaos , in which Athos distinguished raised arms , in which he heard cries , sobs , and groans , he did not see one human figure . 
The cannon thundered at a distance , musketry madly barked , the sea moaned , flocks made their escape , bounding over the verdant slope . 
But not a soldier to apply the match to the batteries of cannon , not a sailor to assist in maneuvering the fleet , not a shepherd in charge of the flocks . 
After the ruin of the village , the destruction of the forts which dominated it , a ruin and destruction magically wrought without the co-operation of a single human being , the flames were extinguished , the smoke began to subside , then diminished in intensity , paled and disappeared entirely . 
Night then came over the scene ; night dark upon the earth , brilliant in the firmament .
