Marius , on the evening following this dialogue , mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched . 
As for the watcher , the first thing he did was to fall asleep .

Travellers for Vernon ! '' 
And Lieutenant Theodule woke . 
`` Good , '' he growled , still half asleep , `` this is where I get out . ''
