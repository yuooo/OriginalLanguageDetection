In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again ; he availed himself of it , but could not accomplish his flight fully . 
He was missing at roll-call . 
The cannon were fired , and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction ; he resisted the galley guards who seized him . 
Escape and rebellion . 
This case , provided for by a special code , was punished by an addition of five years , two of them in the double chain . 
Thirteen years . 
In the tenth year his turn came round again ; he again profited by it ; he succeeded no better . 
Three years for this fresh attempt . 
Sixteen years . 
Finally , I think it was during his thirteenth year , he made a last attempt , and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence .
