He had but one word for both these kinds of toil ; he called them gardening . 
`` The mind is a garden , '' said he . 
Towards mid-day , when the weather was fine , he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town , often entering lowly dwellings . 
He was seen walking alone , buried in his own thoughts , his eyes cast down , supporting himself on his long cane , clad in his wadded purple garment of silk , which was very warm , wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes , and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points . 
It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared . 
One would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it . 
The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun . 
He bestowed his blessing , and they blessed him . 
They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything . 
Here and there he halted , accosted the little boys and girls , and smiled upon the mothers .
