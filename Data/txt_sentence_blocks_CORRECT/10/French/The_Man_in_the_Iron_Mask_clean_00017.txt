`` Oh , monseigneur ! 
you drive me to despair , '' said he , striking the armchair with his fist . 
`` And , on my part , I do not comprehend you , monsieur . '' 
`` Well , then , try to understand me . '' 
The prisoner looked fixedly at Aramis . 
`` Sometimes it seems to me , '' said the latter , `` that I have before me the man whom I seek , and then - '' `` And then your man disappears , - is it not so ? '' 
said the prisoner , smiling . 
`` So much the better . '' 
Aramis rose . 
`` Certainly , '' said he ; `` I have nothing further to say to a man who mistrusts me as you do . ''
