What a festival everywhere ! 
The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou . 
Summer , I salute thee ! 
O Luxembourg ! 
O Georgics of the Rue Madame , and of the Allee de l'Observatoire ! 
O pensive infantry soldiers ! 
O all those charming nurses who , while they guard the children , amuse themselves ! 
The pampas of America would please me if I had not the arcades of the Odeon . 
My soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas . 
All is beautiful .
