He had no sack , but evidently he had large pockets under his coat . 
From time to time he halted , scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed , bent over abruptly , disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground , then rose and fled . 
His sliding motion , his attitudes , his mysterious and rapid gestures , caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins , and which ancient Norman legends call the Alleurs . 
Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes . 
A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler 's wagon with a fluted wicker hood , harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted , hidden , as it were , behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to Nivelles , at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean to Braine l'Alleud ; and in the wagon , a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages . 
Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler . 
The darkness was serene . 
Not a cloud in the zenith . 
What matters it if the earth be red ! 
the moon remains white ; these are the indifferences of the sky .
