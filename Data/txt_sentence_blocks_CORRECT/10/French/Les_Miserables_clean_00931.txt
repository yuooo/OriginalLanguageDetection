`` Cosette . '' 
The man seemed to have received an electric shock . 
He looked at her once more ; then he removed his hands from Cosette 's shoulders , seized the bucket , and set out again . 
After a moment he inquired : -- `` Where do you live , little one ? '' 
`` At Montfermeil , if you know where that is . '' 
`` That is where we are going ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
He paused ; then began again : -- `` Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest ? '' 
`` It was Madame Thenardier . '' 
The man resumed , in a voice which he strove to render indifferent , but in which there was , nevertheless , a singular tremor : -- `` What does your Madame Thenardier do ? ''
