The major bowed in token of assent . 
`` That is why , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I propose to cause two of the principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel . 
They will see you , gentlemen ; they will see the forces we have at our disposal ; they will consequently know to what they have to trust , and the fate that attends them , in case of rebellion . 
We will affirm to them , upon our honor , that M. Fouquet is a prisoner , and that all resistance can only be prejudicial to them . 
We will tell them that at the first cannon fired , there will be no further hope of mercy from the king . 
Then , or so at least I trust , they will resist no longer . 
They will yield up without fighting , and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue . '' 
The officer who had followed D'Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to speak , but D'Artagnan interrupted him . 
`` Yes , I know what you are going to tell me , monsieur ; I know that there is an order of the king 's to prevent all secret communications with the defenders of Belle-Isle , and that is exactly why I do not offer to communicate except in presence of my staff . '' 
And D'Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers , who knew him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension .
