Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty ; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily . 
They set noiselessly to work , and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . 
They were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . 
Passepartout and the guide stopped . 
Had they been heard ? 
Was the alarm being given ? 
Common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis . 
They again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . 
But , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise . 
It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work .
