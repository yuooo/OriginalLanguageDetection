Let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes . 
I propose a toast to mirth ; be merry . 
Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating ! 
Indigestion and the digest . 
Let Justinian be the male , and Feasting , the female ! 
Joy in the depths ! 
Live , O creation ! 
The world is a great diamond . 
I am happy . 
The birds are astonishing .
