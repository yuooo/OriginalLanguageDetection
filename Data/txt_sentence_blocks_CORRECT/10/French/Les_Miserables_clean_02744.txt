`` That 's right , old street , '' ejaculated Gavroche , `` put on your night-cap . '' 
And turning to Jean Valjean : -- `` What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street ? 
It 's the Archives , is n't it ? 
I must crumble up those big stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them . '' 
Jean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche . 
`` Poor creature , '' he said in a low tone , and speaking to himself , `` he is hungry . '' 
And he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand . 
Gavroche raised his face , astonished at the size of this sou ; he stared at it in the darkness , and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him . 
He knew five-franc pieces by hearsay ; their reputation was agreeable to him ; he was delighted to see one close to . 
He said : -- `` Let us contemplate the tiger . ''
