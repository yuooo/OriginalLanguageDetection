said Fauchelevent ; `` what a capital idea that was of yours , Father Madeleine ! '' 
They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world . 
In the neighborhood of the cemetery , a shovel and pick are equal to two passports . 
The Rue Vaugirard was deserted . 
`` Father Madeleine , '' said Fauchelevent as they went along , and raising his eyes to the houses , `` Your eyes are better than mine . 
Show me No. 87 . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` There is no one in the street , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` Give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me . '' 
Fauchelevent entered No. 87 , ascended to the very top , guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret , and knocked in the dark , at the door of an attic .
