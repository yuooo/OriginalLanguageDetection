Aramis pressed the arm of Porthos with both his hands , and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where the three rowers awaited him . 
Porthos , left alone , applied the spark bravely to the match . 
The spark - a feeble spark , first principle of conflagration - shone in the darkness like a glow-worm , then was deadened against the match which it set fire to , Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath . 
The smoke was a little dispersed , and by the light of the sparkling match objects might , for two seconds , be distinguished . 
It was a brief but splendid spectacle , that of this giant , pale , bloody , his countenance lighted by the fire of the match burning in surrounding darkness ! 
The soldiers saw him , they saw the barrel he held in his hand - they at once understood what was going to happen . 
Then , these men , already choked with horror at the sight of what had been accomplished , filled with terror at thought of what was about to be accomplished , gave out a simultaneous shriek of agony . 
Some endeavored to fly , but they encountered the third brigade , which barred their passage ; others mechanically took aim and attempted to fire their discharged muskets ; others fell instinctively upon their knees . 
Two or three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his liberty if he would spare their lives . 
The lieutenant of the third brigade commanded his men to fire ; but the guards had before them their terrified companions , who served as a living rampart for Porthos .
