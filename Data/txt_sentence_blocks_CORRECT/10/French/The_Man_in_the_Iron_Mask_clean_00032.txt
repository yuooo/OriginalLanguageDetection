` Doubtless , doubtless , ' continued the old gentleman ; ` but this letter contained instructions - how can I follow them ? ' '' 
` Write immediately to her ; give her a plain account of the accident , and the queen will no doubt write you another letter in place of this . ' '' 
` Oh ! 
the queen would never believe the story , ' said the good gentleman , shaking his head ; ` she will imagine that I want to keep this letter instead of giving it up like the rest , so as to have a hold over her . 
She is so distrustful , and M. de Mazarin so - Yon devil of an Italian is capable of having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion . ' '' 
Aramis almost imperceptibly smiled . '' 
` You know , Dame Perronnette , they are both so suspicious in all that concerns Philippe . ' 
`` Philippe was the name they gave me , '' said the prisoner . '' 
` Well , 't is no use hesitating , ' said Dame Perronnette , ` somebody must go down the well . ' '' 
` Of course ; so that the person who goes down may read the paper as he is coming up . ' ''
