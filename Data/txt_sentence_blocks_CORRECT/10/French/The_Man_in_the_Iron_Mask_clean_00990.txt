Night came on , but still the ship drew nearer . 
It might be imagined it redoubled its speed with darkness . 
From time to time , as a vulture rears its head out of its nest , the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides , and cast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall . 
At last it came within musket-shot . 
All the men were on deck , arms in hand ; the cannoniers were at their guns , the matches burning . 
It might be thought they were about to board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in number to their own , not to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by four people . 
`` Surrender ! '' 
cried the commander of the balancelle , with the aid of his speaking-trumpet . 
The sailors looked at Aramis . 
Aramis made a sign with his head .
