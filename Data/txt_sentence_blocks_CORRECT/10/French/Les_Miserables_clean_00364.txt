She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age . 
The arms of mothers are made of tenderness ; in them children sleep profoundly . 
As for the mother , her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken . 
She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again . 
She was young . 
Was she handsome ? 
Perhaps ; but in that attire it was not apparent . 
Her hair , a golden lock of which had escaped , seemed very thick , but was severely concealed beneath an ugly , tight , close , nun-like cap , tied under the chin . 
A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them ; but she did not smile . 
Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time .
