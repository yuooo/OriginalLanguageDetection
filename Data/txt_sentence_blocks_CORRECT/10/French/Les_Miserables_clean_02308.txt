That is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand . 
The lightning must , at the same time , have hindered and helped him . 
Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof , from enclosure to enclosure , from compartment to compartment , to the buildings of the Charlemagne court , then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court , to the outer wall , and thence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile ? 
But in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility . 
Had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air to the outer wall , and crawled flat , on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut ? 
But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line ; it mounted and descended , it dropped at the firemen 's barracks , it rose towards the bath-house , it was cut in twain by buildings , it was not even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavee ; everywhere occurred falls and right angles ; and then , the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive ; hence , the route taken by Thenardier still remains rather inexplicable . 
In two manners , flight was impossible . 
Had Thenardier , spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches , iron bars into wattles of osier , a legless man into an athlete , a gouty man into a bird , stupidity into instinct , instinct into intelligence , and intelligence into genius , had Thenardier invented a third mode ? 
No one has ever found out . 
The marvels of escape can not always be accounted for .
