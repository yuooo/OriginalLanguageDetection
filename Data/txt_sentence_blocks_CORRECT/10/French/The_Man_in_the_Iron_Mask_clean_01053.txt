I leave to my intendant Mousqueton all of my clothes , of city , war , or chase , to the number of forty-seven suits , in the assurance that he will wear them till they are worn out , for the love of and in remembrance of his master . 
Moreover , I bequeath to M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne my old servant and faithful friend Mousqueton , already named , providing that the said vicomte shall so act that Mousqueton shall declare , when dying , he has never ceased to be happy . '' 
On hearing these words , Mousqueton bowed , pale and trembling ; his shoulders shook convulsively ; his countenance , compressed by a frightful grief , appeared from between his icy hands , and the spectators saw him stagger and hesitate , as if , though wishing to leave the hall , he did not know the way . 
`` Mousqueton , my good friend , '' said D'Artagnan , `` go and make your preparations . 
I will take you with me to Athos 's house , whither I shall go on leaving Pierrefonds . '' 
Mousqueton made no reply . 
He scarcely breathed , as if everything in that hall would from that time be foreign . 
He opened the door , and slowly disappeared . 
The procureur finished his reading , after which the greater part of those who had come to hear the last will of Porthos dispersed by degrees , many disappointed , but all penetrated with respect . 
As for D'Artagnan , thus left alone , after having received the formal compliments of the procureur , he was lost in admiration of the wisdom of the testator , who had so judiciously bestowed his wealth upon the most necessitous and the most worthy , with a delicacy that neither nobleman nor courtier could have displayed more kindly .
