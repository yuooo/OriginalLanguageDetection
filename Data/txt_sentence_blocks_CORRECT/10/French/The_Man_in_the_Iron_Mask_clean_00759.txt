Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? ''
