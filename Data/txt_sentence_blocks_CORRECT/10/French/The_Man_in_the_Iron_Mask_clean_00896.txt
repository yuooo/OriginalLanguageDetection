`` Well , having this weakness , my father insisted upon going down into the garden , instead of going to bed ; his foot slipped on the first stair , the staircase was steep ; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed . 
The hinge gashed his temple ; and he was stretched out dead upon the spot . '' 
Aramis raised his eyes to his friend : `` These are two extraordinary circumstances , '' said he ; `` let us not infer that there may succeed a third . 
It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious , my brave Porthos . 
Besides , when were your legs known to fail ? 
Never have you stood so firm , so haughtily ; why , you could carry a house on your shoulders . '' 
`` At this moment , '' said Porthos , `` I feel myself pretty active ; but at times I vacillate ; I sink ; and lately this phenomenon , as you say , has occurred four times . 
I will not say this frightens me , but it annoys me . 
Life is an agreeable thing .
