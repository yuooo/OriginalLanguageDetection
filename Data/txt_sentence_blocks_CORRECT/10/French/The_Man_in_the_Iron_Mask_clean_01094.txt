The latter , upon being questioned by monseigneur , replied that he saw plainly three mortal wounds out of eight , but so strong was the constitution of the wounded , so rich was he in youth , and so merciful was the goodness of God , that perhaps M. de Bragelonne might recover , particularly if he did not move in the slightest manner . 
Frere Sylvain added , turning towards his assistants , ` Above everything , do not allow him to move , even a finger , or you will kill him ; ' and we all left the tent in very low spirits . 
That secretary I have mentioned , on leaving the tent , thought he perceived a faint and sad smile glide over the lips of M. de Bragelonne when the duke said to him , in a cheerful , kind voice , ` We will save you , vicomte , we will save you yet . ' 
`` In the evening , when it was believed the wounded youth had taken some repose , one of the assistants entered his tent , but rushed out again immediately , uttering loud cries . 
We all ran up in disorder , M. le duc with us , and the assistant pointed to the body of M. de Bragelonne upon the ground , at the foot of his bed , bathed in the remainder of his blood . 
It appeared that he had suffered some convulsion , some delirium , and that he had fallen ; that the fall had accelerated his end , according to the prognosis of Frere Sylvain . 
We raised the vicomte ; he was cold and dead . 
He held a lock of fair hair in his right hand , and that hand was tightly pressed upon his heart . '' 
Then followed the details of the expedition , and of the victory obtained over the Arabs . 
D'Artagnan stopped at the account of the death of poor Raoul .
