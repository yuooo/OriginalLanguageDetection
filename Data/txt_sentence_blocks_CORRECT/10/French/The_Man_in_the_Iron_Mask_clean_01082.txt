He advanced on tip-toe , trembling , frightened at the noise his feet made on the floor , his heart rent by a nameless agony . 
He placed his ear to the breast of Athos , his face to the comte 's mouth . 
Neither noise , nor breath ! 
D'Artagnan drew back . 
Grimaud , who had followed him with his eyes , and for whom each of his movements had been a revelation , came timidly ; seated himself at the foot of the bed , and glued his lips to the sheet which was raised by the stiffened feet of his master . 
Then large drops began to flow from his red eyes . 
This old man in invincible despair , who wept , bent doubled without uttering a word , presented the most touching spectacle that D'Artagnan , in a life so filled with emotion , had ever met with . 
The captain resumed standing in contemplation before that smiling dead man , who seemed to have burnished his last thought , to give his best friend , the man he had loved next to Raoul , a gracious welcome even beyond life . 
And for reply to that exalted flattery of hospitality , D'Artagnan went and kissed Athos fervently on the brow , and with his trembling fingers closed his eyes . 
Then he seated himself by the pillow without dread of that dead man , who had been so kind and affectionate to him for five and thirty years .
