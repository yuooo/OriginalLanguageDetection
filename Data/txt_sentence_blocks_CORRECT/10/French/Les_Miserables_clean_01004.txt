No one knew the man ; as Cosette was no longer in rags , many did not recognize her . 
Cosette was going away . 
With whom ? 
She did not know . 
Whither ? 
She knew not . 
All that she understood was that she was leaving the Thenardier tavern behind her . 
No one had thought of bidding her farewell , nor had she thought of taking leave of any one . 
She was leaving that hated and hating house . 
Poor , gentle creature , whose heart had been repressed up to that hour !
