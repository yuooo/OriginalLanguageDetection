`` Seeing , then , that my nurse and preceptor were carried off , and that I , also , was separated from them - either they were , or I am , very dangerous to my enemy ? '' 
`` Yes ; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself , by causing the nurse and preceptor to disappear , '' answered Aramis , quietly . 
`` Disappear ! '' 
cried the prisoner , `` how did they disappear ? '' 
`` In a very sure way , '' answered Aramis - `` they are dead . '' 
The young man turned pale , and passed his hand tremblingly over his face . 
`` Poison ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Poison . ''
