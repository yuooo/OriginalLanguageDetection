The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple , defended by eighty men , attacked by ten thousand , held out for three days . 
On the fourth , they did as at Zaatcha , as at Constantine , they pierced the houses , they came over the roofs , the barricade was taken . 
Not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight , all were killed there with the exception of the leader , Barthelemy , of whom we shall speak presently . 
The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders ; the barricade of the Temple was silence . 
The difference between these two redoubts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister .
