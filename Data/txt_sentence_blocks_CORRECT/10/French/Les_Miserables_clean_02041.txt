Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about , and see how he is getting on . '' 
One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras reached the Richefeu smoking-room . 
He pushed open the door , entered , folded his arms , letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders , and gazed at that room filled with tables , men , and smoke . 
A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke , interrupted by another voice . 
It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary . 
Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure , at a marble Saint-Anne table , strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos . 
He was hammering the table with his fist , and this is what Enjolras heard : -- `` Double-six . '' 
`` Fours . '' 
`` The pig ! 
I have no more . ''
