The priests took their places in front of the judge , and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant , who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion . 
`` You hear the charge ? '' 
asked the judge . 
`` Yes , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg , consulting his watch , `` and I admit it . '' 
`` You admit it ? '' 
`` I admit it , and I wish to hear these priests admit , in their turn , what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji . '' 
The priests looked at each other ; they did not seem to understand what was said . 
`` Yes , '' cried Passepartout , warmly ; `` at the pagoda of Pillaji , where they were on the point of burning their victim . '' 
The judge stared with astonishment , and the priests were stupefied . 
`` What victim ? ''
