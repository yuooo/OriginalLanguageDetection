Barthelemy , thin , feeble , pale , taciturn , was a sort of tragic street urchin , who , having had his ears boxed by a policeman , lay in wait for him , and killed him , and at seventeen was sent to the galleys . 
He came out and made this barricade . 
Later on , fatal circumstance , in London , proscribed by all , Barthelemy slew Cournet . 
It was a funereal duel . 
Some time afterwards , caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part , a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuating circumstances , and in which English justice sees only death , Barthelemy was hanged . 
The sombre social construction is so made that , thanks to material destitution , thanks to moral obscurity , that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence , certainly firm , possibly great , began in France with the galleys , and ended in England with the gallows . 
Barthelemy , on occasion , flew but one flag , the black flag . 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection , and June , 1848 , knew a great deal more about it than June , 1832 . 
So the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline , and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched ; but it was formidable for that epoch . 
The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras , for Marius no longer looked after anything , had made good use of the night .
