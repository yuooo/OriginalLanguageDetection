`` Do you not laugh , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I laugh no longer now , M. d'Herblay . 
The fete is approaching ; money is departing . '' 
`` Have I not told you that was my business ? '' 
`` Yes , you promised me millions . '' 
`` You shall have them the day after the king 's entree into Vaux . '' 
Fouquet looked closely at Aramis , and passed the back of his icy hand across his moistened brow . 
Aramis perceived that the superintendent either doubted him , or felt he was powerless to obtain the money . 
How could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop , ex-abbe , ex-musketeer , could find any ?
