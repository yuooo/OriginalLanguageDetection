M. de Baisemeaux , '' he added , in a sonorous voice , drawing the unhappy governor towards him , `` do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur ; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out of my senses ; I am trembling all over - in fact , I feel as though I were about to faint . '' 
`` You will stand a better chance of fainting outright , Monsieur Baisemeaux , when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and thirty pieces of cannon . '' 
`` Good heavens , monseigneur , you are losing your senses . '' 
`` When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your accursed towers , and have battered open the gates of this place , and hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle ! '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! 
for pity 's sake ! '' 
`` I give you ten minutes to make up your mind , '' added Fouquet , in a calm voice . 
`` I will sit down here , in this armchair , and wait for you ; if , in ten minutes ' time , you still persist , I leave this place , and you may think me as mad as you like .
