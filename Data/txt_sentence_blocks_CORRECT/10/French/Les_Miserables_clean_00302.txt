She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents ? 
Who can say ?

She was called Fantine . 
Why Fantine ? 
She had never borne any other name . 
At the epoch of her birth the Directory still existed . 
She had no family name ; she had no family ; no baptismal name ; the Church no longer existed . 
She bore the name which pleased the first random passer-by , who had encountered her , when a very small child , running bare-legged in the street . 
She received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained .
