On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington . 
`` That little Englishman needs a lesson , '' said Napoleon . 
The rain redoubled in violence ; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking . 
At half-past three o'clock in the morning , he lost one illusion ; officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement . 
Nothing was stirring ; not a bivouac-fire had been extinguished ; the English army was asleep . 
The silence on earth was profound ; the only noise was in the heavens . 
At four o'clock , a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts ; this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry , probably Vivian 's brigade , which was on its way to take up a position in the village of Ohain , at the extreme left . 
At five o'clock , two Belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment , and that the English army was ready for battle . 
`` So much the better ! '' 
exclaimed Napoleon .
