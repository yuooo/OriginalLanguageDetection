There was every sort of thing in that fireplace , a brazier , a pot , broken boards , rags suspended from nails , a bird-cage , ashes , and even a little fire . 
Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way . 
One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was , that it was large . 
It had projections and angles and black holes , the lower sides of roofs , bays , and promontories . 
Hence horrible , unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one 's fist , wood-lice as large as one 's foot , and perhaps even -- who knows ? 
-- some monstrous human beings , must be hiding . 
One of the pallets was near the door , the other near the window . 
One end of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius . 
In a corner near the aperture through which Marius was gazing , a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall , and at its bottom , in large letters , was the inscription : THE DREAM . 
This represented a sleeping woman , and a child , also asleep , the child on the woman 's lap , an eagle in a cloud , with a crown in his beak , and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child 's head , without awaking the latter ; in the background , Napoleon in a glory , leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription : MARINGO AUSTERLITS IENA WAGRAMME ELOT Beneath this frame , a sort of wooden panel , which was no longer than it was broad , stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall .
