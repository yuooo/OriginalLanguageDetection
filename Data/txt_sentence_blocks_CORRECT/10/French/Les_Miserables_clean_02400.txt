He had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her , he owed her his happiness , and yet , it was embarrassing to him to meet her . 
It is an error to think that passion , when it is pure and happy , leads man to a state of perfection ; it simply leads him , as we have noted , to a state of oblivion . 
In this situation , man forgets to be bad , but he also forgets to be good . 
Gratitude , duty , matters essential and important to be remembered , vanish . 
At any other time , Marius would have behaved quite differently to Eponine . 
Absorbed in Cosette , he had not even clearly put it to himself that this Eponine was named Eponine Thenardier , and that she bore the name inscribed in his father 's will , that name , for which , but a few months before , he would have so ardently sacrificed himself . 
We show Marius as he was . 
His father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent , under the splendor of his love . 
He replied with some embarrassment : -- `` Ah ! 
so it 's you , Eponine ? ''
