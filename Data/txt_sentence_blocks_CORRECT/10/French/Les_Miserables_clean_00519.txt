We are wasting our time , and we have pressing business on hand . 
Javert , you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman Buseaupied , who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve . 
You will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre Chesnelong . 
The man is a brute , who came near crushing this woman and her child . 
He must be punished . 
You will then go to M. Charcellay , Rue Montre-de-Champigny . 
He complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises , and is undermining the foundations of his house . 
After that , you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the Rue Guibourg , at Widow Doris 's , and Rue du Garraud-Blanc , at Madame Renee le Bosse 's , and you will prepare documents . 
But I am giving you a great deal of work . 
Are you not to be absent ?
