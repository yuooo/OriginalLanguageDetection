D'Artagnan took his hat again , bowed to M. de Gesvres , and returned to his own apartments . 
He came back at half-past nine , and was told that the king was at breakfast . 
`` That will just suit me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I will talk to the king while he is eating . '' 
M. de Brienne reminded D'Artagnan that the king would not see any one at meal-time . 
`` But , '' said D'Artagnan , looking askant at Brienne , `` you do not know , perhaps , monsieur , that I have the privilege of entree anywhere - and at any hour . '' 
Brienne took the captain 's hand kindly , and said , `` Not at Nantes , dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
The king , in this journey , has changed everything . '' 
D'Artagnan , a little softened , asked about what o'clock the king would have finished his breakfast . 
`` We do n't know . ''
