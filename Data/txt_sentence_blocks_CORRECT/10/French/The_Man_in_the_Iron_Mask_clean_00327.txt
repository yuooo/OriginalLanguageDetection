The one who carried the lantern walked first , the king followed him , while the second masked figure closed the procession . 
In this manner they passed along a winding gallery of some length , with as many staircases leading out of it as are to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe 's creation . 
All these windings and turnings , during which the king heard the sound of running water over his head , ended at last in a long corridor closed by an iron door . 
The figure with the lamp opened the door with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle , where , during the whole of the brief journey , the king had heard them rattle . 
As soon as the door was opened and admitted the air , Louis recognized the balmy odors that trees exhale in hot summer nights . 
He paused , hesitatingly , for a moment or two ; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him out of the subterranean passage . 
`` Another blow , '' said the king , turning towards the one who had just had the audacity to touch his sovereign ; `` what do you intend to do with the king of France ? '' 
`` Try to forget that word , '' replied the man with the lamp , in a tone which as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of Minos . 
`` You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just made use of , '' said the giant , as he extinguished the lamp his companion handed to him ; `` but the king is too kind-hearted . '' 
Louis , at that threat , made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if he meditated flight ; but the giant 's hand was in a moment placed on his shoulder , and fixed him motionless where he stood .
