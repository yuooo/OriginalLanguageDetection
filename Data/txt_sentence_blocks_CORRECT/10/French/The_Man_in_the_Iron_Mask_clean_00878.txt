`` Monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other , `` monsieur , if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here , what would you do ? '' 
`` I should not oppose it , monsieur ; but having direct explicit orders to put them under guard , I should detain them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` That 's all over , '' said Aramis , gloomily . 
Porthos did not stir . 
`` But still take Porthos , '' said the bishop of Vannes . 
`` He can prove to the king , and I will help him do so , and you too , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that he had nothing to do with this affair . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said D'Artagnan .
