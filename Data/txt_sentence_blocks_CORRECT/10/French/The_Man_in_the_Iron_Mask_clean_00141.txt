`` I say I shall never be aught but an ass , '' answered La Fontaine , with a heavy sigh and swimming eyes . 
`` Yes , my friend , '' he added , with increasing grief , `` it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , 't is wrong to say so . '' 
`` Nay , I am a poor creature ! '' 
`` Who said so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
't was Pelisson ; did you not , Pelisson ? '' 
Pelisson , again absorbed in his work , took good care not to answer . 
`` But if Pelisson said you were so , '' cried Moliere , `` Pelisson has seriously offended you . '' 
`` Do you think so ? ''
