This English woman , who had become a naturalized Parisienne , recommended by very wealthy relations , intimately connected with the medals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mar 's diamonds , became celebrated later on in judicial accounts . 
She was called Mamselle Miss. . 
The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to complain of their lot . 
Recommended by the eighty francs , they were well cared for , as is everything from which profit is derived ; they were neither badly clothed , nor badly fed ; they were treated almost like `` little gentlemen , '' -- better by their false mother than by their real one . 
Magnon played the lady , and talked no thieves ' slang in their presence . 
Thus passed several years . 
Thenardier augured well from the fact . 
One day , he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs : `` The father must give them some education . '' 
All at once , these two poor children , who had up to that time been protected tolerably well , even by their evil fate , were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves . 
A wholesale arrest of malefactors , like that in the Jondrette garret , necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations , is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter-society which pursues its existence beneath public society ; an adventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world .
