One morning he was in his garden , and thought himself alone , but his sister was walking behind him , unseen by him : suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground ; it was a large , black , hairy , frightful spider . 
His sister heard him say : -- `` Poor beast ! 
It is not its fault ! ''

One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant . 
Thus lived this just man . 
Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden , and then there was nothing more venerable possible .
