Fix , fairly puzzled , descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections . 
He was evidently suspected ; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective . 
But had he told his master ? 
What part was he playing in all this : was he an accomplice or not ? 
Was the game , then , up ? 
Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind , sometimes thinking that all was lost , then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence , and then undecided what course it was best to take . 
Nevertheless , he preserved his coolness of mind , and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout . 
If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong , and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory , he , Fix , would tell Passepartout all . 
Either the servant was the accomplice of his master , and in this case the master knew of his operations , and he should fail ; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery , and then his interest would be to abandon the robber . 
Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout .
