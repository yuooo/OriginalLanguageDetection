`` Ah ! 
is that you , miserable wretch ? ''

`` Very good , very good . ''

The king entered the cell without pronouncing a single word : he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily . 
Baisemeaux shut the door upon him , turned the key twice in the lock , and then returned to Aramis . 
`` It is quite true , '' he said , in a low tone , `` that he bears a striking resemblance to the king ; but less so than you said . '' 
`` So that , '' said Aramis , `` you would not have been deceived by the substitution of the one for the other ? ''
