The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel ; a faulty construction , imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries , logical in a prison , illogical in a sewer , and which has since been corrected . 
Jean Valjean reached the outlet . 
There he halted . 
It certainly was the outlet , but he could not get out . 
The arch was closed by a heavy grating , and the grating , which , to all appearance , rarely swung on its rusty hinges , was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock , which , red with rust , seemed like an enormous brick . 
The keyhole could be seen , and the robust latch , deeply sunk in the iron staple . 
The door was plainly double-locked . 
It was one of those prison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing . 
Beyond the grating was the open air , the river , the daylight , the shore , very narrow but sufficient for escape . 
The distant quays , Paris , that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself , the broad horizon , liberty .
