`` Before we pass to M. Fouquet , I should very much regret forgetting another friend of mine . '' 
`` M. du Vallon , the Hercules of France , you mean ; oh ! 
as far as he is concerned , his interests are more than safe . '' 
`` No ; it is not he whom I intended to refer to . '' 
`` The Comte de la Fere , then ? '' 
`` And his son , the son of all four of us . '' 
`` That poor boy who is dying of love for La Valliere , whom my brother so disloyally bereft him of ? 
Be easy on that score . 
I shall know how to rehabilitate his happiness . 
Tell me only one thing , Monsieur d'Herblay ; do men , when they love , forget the treachery that has been shown them ?
