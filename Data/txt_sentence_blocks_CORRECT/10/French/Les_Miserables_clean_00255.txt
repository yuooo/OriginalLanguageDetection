The only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision . 
One would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses , -- the one in which one loses one 's self and that in which one saves one 's self . 
He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand . 
At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow , and he took off his cap ; then his arm fell back with the same deliberation , and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more , his cap in his left hand , his club in his right hand , his hair bristling all over his savage head . 
The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze . 
The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney-piece , which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them , with a benediction for one and pardon for the other . 
Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow ; then stepped rapidly past the bed , without glancing at the Bishop , straight to the cupboard , which he saw near the head ; he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock ; the key was there ; he opened it ; the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware ; he seized it , traversed the chamber with long strides , without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise , gained the door , re-entered the oratory , opened the window , seized his cudgel , bestrode the window-sill of the ground-floor , put the silver into his knapsack , threw away the basket , crossed the garden , leaped over the wall like a tiger , and fled . 
THE BISHOP WORKS The next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in his garden . 
Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation . 
`` Monseigneur , Monseigneur ! ''
