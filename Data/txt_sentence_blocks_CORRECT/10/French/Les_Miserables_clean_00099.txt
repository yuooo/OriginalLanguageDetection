The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop 's arm . 
`` Louis XVII . ! 
let us see . 
For whom do you mourn ? 
is it for the innocent child ? 
very good ; in that case I mourn with you . 
Is it for the royal child ? 
I demand time for reflection . 
To me , the brother of Cartouche , an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve , until death ensued , for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche , is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV. , an innocent child , martyred in the tower of the Temple , for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV .
