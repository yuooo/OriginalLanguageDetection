And some rushed forward , and others drew up in line , for a passing king always creates a tumult ; besides , the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII . 
produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris . 
It was rapid but majestic . 
This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop ; as he was not able to walk , he wished to run : that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning . 
He passed , pacific and severe , in the midst of naked swords . 
His massive couch , all covered with gilding , with great branches of lilies painted on the panels , thundered noisily along . 
There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it . 
In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large , firm , and ruddy face , a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseau royal , a proud , hard , crafty eye , the smile of an educated man , two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat , the Golden Fleece , the cross of Saint Louis , the cross of the Legion of Honor , the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit , a huge belly , and a wide blue ribbon : it was the king . 
Outside of Paris , he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters ; when he re-entered the city , he put on his hat and saluted rarely ; he stared coldly at the people , and they returned it in kind . 
When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter , the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade , `` That big fellow yonder is the government . ''
