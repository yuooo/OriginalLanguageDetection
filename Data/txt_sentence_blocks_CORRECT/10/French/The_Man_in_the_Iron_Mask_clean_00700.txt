`` Shut the doors , '' said Fouquet , and the servants disappeared . 
`` My friends , '' continued Fouquet , lowering his voice , `` what was I formerly ? 
What am I now ? 
Consult among yourselves and reply . 
A man like me sinks when he does not continue to rise . 
What shall we say , then , when he really sinks ? 
I have no more money , no more credit ; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies , and powerless friends . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried Pelisson .
