`` Have you it about you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Give it to me , '' said the inspector . 
Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket , handed it to the inspector and added : -- `` If you will take my advice , you will come in force . '' 
The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him ; with one movement he plunged his hands , which were enormous , into the two immense pockets of his top-coat , and pulled out two small steel pistols , of the sort called `` knock-me-downs . '' 
Then he presented them to Marius , saying rapidly , in a curt tone : -- `` Take these . 
Go home . 
Hide in your chamber , so that you may be supposed to have gone out . 
They are loaded . 
Each one carries two balls .
