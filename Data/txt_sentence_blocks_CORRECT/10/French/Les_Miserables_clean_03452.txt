When two men are there , they must meet . 
That is what happened . 
The man domiciled there and the passer-by were forced to bid each other good-day , greatly to the regret of both . 
The passer-by said to the inhabitant : -- `` You see what I have on my back , I must get out , you have the key , give it to me . '' 
That convict was a man of terrible strength . 
There was no way of refusing . 
Nevertheless , the man who had the key parleyed , simply to gain time . 
He examined the dead man , but he could see nothing , except that the latter was young , well dressed , with the air of being rich , and all disfigured with blood . 
While talking , the man contrived to tear and pull off behind , without the assassin perceiving it , a bit of the assassinated man 's coat . 
A document for conviction , you understand ; a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal .
