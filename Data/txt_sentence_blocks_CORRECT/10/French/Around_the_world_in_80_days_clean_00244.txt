IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES , AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR , A COURSE OF MORMON HISTORY During the night of the 5th of December , the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles ; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction , towards the Great Salt Lake . 
Passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . 
The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . 
The sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform . 
This personage , who had taken the train at Elko , was tall and dark , with black moustache , black stockings , a black silk hat , a black waistcoat , black trousers , a white cravat , and dogskin gloves . 
He might have been taken for a clergyman . 
He went from one end of the train to the other , and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript . 
Passepartout approached and read one of these notices , which stated that Elder William Hitch , Mormon missionary , taking advantage of his presence on train No. 48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No. 117 , from eleven to twelve o'clock ; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the `` Latter Day Saints '' to attend . 
`` I 'll go , '' said Passepartout to himself . 
He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy , which is its foundation .
