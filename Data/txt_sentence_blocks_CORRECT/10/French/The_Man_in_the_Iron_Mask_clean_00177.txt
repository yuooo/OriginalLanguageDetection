`` You wish , then - '' `` I wish that you would do your duty , my friend ; yes , at least before this soldier . '' '' 
'T is mathematically true , '' exclaimed Baisemeaux . 
Francois still waited : `` Let them send this order of the king 's up to me , '' he repeated , recovering himself . 
And he added in a low tone , `` Do you know what it is ? 
I will tell you something about as interesting as this . 
` Beware of fire near the powder magazine ; ' or , ` Look close after such and such a one , who is clever at escaping , ' Ah ! 
if you only knew , monseigneur , how many times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest , deepest slumber , by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me , or rather , bring me a slip of paper containing these words : ` Monsieur de Baisemeaux , what news ? ' 
'T is clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile . 
They would know better ; they have never considered the thickness of my walls , the vigilance of my officers , the number of rounds we go .
