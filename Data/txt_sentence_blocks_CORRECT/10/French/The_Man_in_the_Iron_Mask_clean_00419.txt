`` Do you remember , '' said the bishop , casting down his eyes , `` the birth of Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` As if it were yesterday . '' 
`` Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth ? '' 
`` Nothing ; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` That does not matter to us , or the kingdom either ; he is the son of his father , says the French law , whose father is recognized by law . '' 
`` True ; but it is a grave matter , when the quality of races is called into question . '' 
`` A merely secondary question , after all . 
So that , in fact , you have never learned or heard anything in particular ? '' 
`` Nothing . ''
