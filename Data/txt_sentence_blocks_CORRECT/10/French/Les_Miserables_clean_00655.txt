He was out of breath ; he staggered ; he leaned against the wall . 
The stone was cold ; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow ; he straightened himself up with a shiver . 
Then , there alone in the darkness , trembling with cold and with something else , too , perchance , he meditated . 
He had meditated all night long ; he had meditated all the day : he heard within him but one voice , which said , `` Alas ! '' 
A quarter of an hour passed thus . 
At length he bowed his head , sighed with agony , dropped his arms , and retraced his steps . 
He walked slowly , and as though crushed . 
It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back . 
He re-entered the council-chamber . 
The first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door .
