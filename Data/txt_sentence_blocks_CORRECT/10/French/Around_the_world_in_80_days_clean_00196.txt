It was Passepartout ; and what had happened to him was as follows : Shortly after Fix left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers . 
Three hours later , pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea , the poor fellow awoke , and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic . 
The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor , and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness . 
Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls , falling down and creeping up again , and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct , he kept crying out , `` The Carnatic ! 
the Carnatic ! '' 
The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . 
Passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the Carnatic was moving off . 
Several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin , and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China . 
Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze . 
The pure air sobered him .
