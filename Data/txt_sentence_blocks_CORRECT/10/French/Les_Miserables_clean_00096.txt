I voted the end of the tyrant , that is to say , the end of prostitution for woman , the end of slavery for man , the end of night for the child . 
In voting for the Republic , I voted for that . 
I voted for fraternity , concord , the dawn . 
I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors . 
The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light . 
We have caused the fall of the old world , and the old world , that vase of miseries , has become , through its upsetting upon the human race , an urn of joy . '' 
`` Mixed joy , '' said the Bishop . 
`` You may say troubled joy , and to-day , after that fatal return of the past , which is called 1814 , joy which has disappeared ! 
Alas ! 
The work was incomplete , I admit : we demolished the ancient regime in deeds ; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas .
