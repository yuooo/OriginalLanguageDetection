He looked . 
The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect , and Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed . 
A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris , but that was not what really lighted the chamber . 
The hovel was completely illuminated , as it were , by the reflection from a rather large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace , and filled with burning charcoal , the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning . 
The charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red ; a blue flame flickered over it , and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard , where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat . 
In one corner , near the door , and as though prepared for some definite use , two heaps were visible , which appeared to be , the one a heap of old iron , the other a heap of ropes . 
All this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation , to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea . 
The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell , but Jondrette , in this light , had rather the air of a demon than of a smith . 
The heat of the brazier was so great , that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish , and was drooping over . 
An old dark-lantern of copper , worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche , stood on the chimney-piece .
