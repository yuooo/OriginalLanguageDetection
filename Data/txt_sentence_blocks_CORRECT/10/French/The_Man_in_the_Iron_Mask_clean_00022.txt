`` Then you were in prison ? '' 
`` If I am a prisoner here , then I was comparatively free , although in a very narrow sense - a house I never quitted , a garden surrounded with walls I could not climb , these constituted my residence , but you know it , as you have been there . 
In a word , being accustomed to live within these bounds , I never cared to leave them . 
And so you will understand , monsieur , that having never seen anything of the world , I have nothing left to care for ; and therefore , if you relate anything , you will be obliged to explain each item to me as you go along . '' 
`` And I will do so , '' said Aramis , bowing ; `` for it is my duty , monseigneur . '' 
`` Well , then , begin by telling me who was my tutor . '' 
`` A worthy and , above all , an honorable gentleman , monseigneur ; fit guide for both body and soul . 
Had you ever any reason to complain of him ? '' 
`` Oh , no ; quite the contrary . 
But this gentleman of yours often used to tell me that my father and mother were dead .
