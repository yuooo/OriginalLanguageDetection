Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer . 
He had `` a lady 's waist , '' a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook . 
He visited Paris very rarely , and so rarely that Marius had never seen him . 
The cousins knew each other only by name . 
We think we have said that Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand , who preferred him because she did not see him . 
Not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections . 
One morning , Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing . 
Marius had just asked his grandfather 's permission to take a little trip , adding that he meant to set out that very evening . 
`` Go ! '' 
had been his grandfather 's reply , and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside , as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead : `` Here he is passing the night out again . ''
