When these men were re-united , one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence , and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood . 
They halted directly under Thenardier . 
These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant . 
It must be added , that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box . 
Thenardier , not being able to distinguish their visages , lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost . 
Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes , -- these men conversed in slang . 
The first said in a low but distinct voice : -- `` Let 's cut . 
What are we up to here ? '' 
The second replied : `` It 's raining hard enough to put out the very devil 's fire . 
And the bobbies will be along instanter .
