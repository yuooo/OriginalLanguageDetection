murmured Aramis . 
`` Belle-Isle is as much mine for you , as Vaux is mine for the king . 
Go , D'Herblay , go ! 
as long as I live , not a hair of your head shall be injured . '' 
`` Thank you , '' said Aramis , with a cold irony of manner . 
`` Go at once , then , and give me your hand , before we both hasten away ; you to save your life , I to save my honor . '' 
Aramis withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there ; it was stained with his blood . 
He had dug his nails into his flesh , as if in punishment for having nursed so many projects , more vain , insensate , and fleeting than the life of the man himself . 
Fouquet was horror-stricken , and then his heart smote him with pity . 
He threw open his arms as if to embrace him .
