`` Is it true ? 
Is the ` lady ' mine ? '' 
The stranger 's eyes seemed to be full of tears . 
He appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep . 
He nodded to Cosette , and placed the `` lady 's '' hand in her tiny hand . 
Cosette hastily withdrew her hand , as though that of the `` lady '' scorched her , and began to stare at the floor . 
We are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately . 
All at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport . 
`` I shall call her Catherine , '' she said .
