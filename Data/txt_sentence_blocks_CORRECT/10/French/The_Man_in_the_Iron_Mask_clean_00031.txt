` What letter ? ' 
she cried . '' 
` The letter you see down there ; the last letter from the queen . ' 
`` At this word I trembled . 
My tutor - he who passed for my father , he who was continually recommending me modesty and humility - in correspondence with the queen ! '' 
` The queen 's last letter ! ' 
cried Perronnette , without showing more astonishment than at seeing this letter at the bottom of the well ; ` but how came it there ? ' '' ' 
A chance , Dame Perronnette - a singular chance . 
I was entering my room , and on opening the door , the window , too , being open , a puff of air came suddenly and carried off this paper - this letter of her majesty 's ; I darted after it , and gained the window just in time to see it flutter a moment in the breeze and disappear down the well . ' '' 
` Well , ' said Dame Perronnette ; ` and if the letter has fallen into the well , 't is all the same as if it was burnt ; and as the queen burns all her letters every time she comes - ' `` And so you see this lady who came every month was the queen , '' said the prisoner . ''
