He approached . 
An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart , his horse having tumbled down . 
This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that time . 
When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood , Fauchelevent , an ex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated , had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way . 
Fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich , while he , a lawyer , was being ruined . 
This had filled him with jealousy , and he had done all he could , on every occasion , to injure Madeleine . 
Then bankruptcy had come ; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse , and neither family nor children , he had turned carter . 
The horse had two broken legs and could not rise . 
The old man was caught in the wheels . 
The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast .
