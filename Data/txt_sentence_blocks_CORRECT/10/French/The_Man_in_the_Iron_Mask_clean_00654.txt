The horse eagerly respired the salt , sharp perfume of the marshes . 
D'Artagnan put him to a trot ; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house . 
All at once they heard the rapid approach of a horse 's steps , and first believed it to be one of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a road . 
But it was really the return of the horseman . 
They uttered a cry of joyous surprise ; and the captain , springing to the ground like a young man , seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul . 
He held them long embraced thus , without speaking a word , or suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him . 
Then , as rapidly as he had come back , he set off again , with a sharp application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the comte , in a low voice , `` alas ! 
alas ! ''
