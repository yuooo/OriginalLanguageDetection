M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl , once more , and had turned towards the door . 
`` Farewell until this evening , my friends ! '' 
said he . 
`` Six o'clock ? '' 
said Jondrette . 
`` Six o'clock precisely . '' 
At that moment , the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder Jondrette girl . 
`` You are forgetting your coat , sir , '' said she . 
Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter , accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders . 
M. Leblanc turned back and said , with a smile : -- `` I have not forgotten it , I am leaving it . ''
