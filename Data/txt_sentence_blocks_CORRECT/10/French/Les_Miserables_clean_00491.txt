She heard some one breathing close to her bed ; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head . 
His gaze was full of pity , anguish , and supplication . 
She followed its direction , and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall . 
Thenceforth , M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine 's eyes . 
He seemed to her to be clothed in light . 
He was absorbed in a sort of prayer . 
She gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him . 
At last she said timidly : -- `` What are you doing ? '' 
M. Madeleine had been there for an hour . 
He had been waiting for Fantine to awake .
