People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine , in front of Saint-Paul , to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on Cosette 's head . 
Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire . 
Marius , triumphant and radiant , mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition . 
The poor , who had trooped to the door , and who shared their purses , blessed them . 
There were flowers everywhere . 
The house was no less fragrant than the church ; after the incense , roses . 
They thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite ; they had God in their hearts ; destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars ; above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun . 
All at once , the clock struck . 
Marius glanced at Cosette 's charming bare arm , and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice , and Cosette , intercepting Marius ' glance , blushed to her very hair . 
Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had been invited ; they pressed about Cosette .
