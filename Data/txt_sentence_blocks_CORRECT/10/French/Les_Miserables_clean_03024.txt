Jean Valjean was both hungry and thirsty ; especially thirsty ; and this , like the sea , was a place full of water where a man can not drink . 
His strength , which was prodigious , as the reader knows , and which had been but little decreased by age , thanks to his chaste and sober life , began to give way , nevertheless . 
Fatigue began to gain on him ; and as his strength decreased , it made the weight of his burden increase . 
Marius , who was , perhaps , dead , weighed him down as inert bodies weigh . 
Jean Valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed , and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible . 
Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats . 
One of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him . 
From time to time , a breath of fresh air reached him through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer , and re-animated him . 
It might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt-sewer . 
He was , at first , astonished at this sudden widening .
