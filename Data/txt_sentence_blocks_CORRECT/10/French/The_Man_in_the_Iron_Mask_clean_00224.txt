Crossing his arms on his chest , as if to control this new sensation of delight , he drank in delicious draughts of that mysterious air which interpenetrates at night the loftiest forests . 
The sky he was contemplating , the murmuring waters , the universal freshness - was not all this reality ? 
Was not Aramis a madman to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this world ? 
Those exciting pictures of country life , so free from fears and troubles , the ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all young imaginations , are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor , unhappy prisoner , worn out by prison cares , emaciated by the stifling air of the Bastile . 
It was the picture , it will be remembered , drawn by Aramis , when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in the carriage to the prince , and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world . 
Such were the reflections of Aramis as he watched , with an anxiety impossible to describe , the silent progress of the emotions of Philippe , whom he perceived gradually becoming more and more absorbed in his meditations . 
The young prince was offering up an inward prayer to Heaven , to be divinely guided in this trying moment , upon which his life or death depended . 
It was an anxious time for the bishop of Vannes , who had never before been so perplexed . 
His iron will , accustomed to overcome all obstacles , never finding itself inferior or vanquished on any occasion , to be foiled in so vast a project from not having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in all its luxuriance would have on the human mind ! 
Aramis , overwhelmed by anxiety , contemplated with emotion the painful struggle that was taking place in Philippe 's mind .
