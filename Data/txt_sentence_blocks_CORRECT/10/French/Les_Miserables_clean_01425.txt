Although a bourgeois , M. Gillenormand was received in society . 
As he had a double measure of wit , in the first place , that which was born with him , and secondly , that which was attributed to him , he was even sought out and made much of . 
He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there . 
There are people who will have influence at any price , and who will have other people busy themselves over them ; when they can not be oracles , they turn wags . 
M. Gillenormand was not of this nature ; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing . 
He was an oracle everywhere . 
It had happened to him to hold his own against M. de Bonald , and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee . 
About 1817 , he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood , in the Rue Ferou , with Madame la Baronne de T. , a worthy and respectable person , whose husband had been Ambassador of France to Berlin under Louis XVI . 
Baron de T. , who , during his lifetime , had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions , had died bankrupt , during the emigration , leaving , as his entire fortune , some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub , in ten manuscript volumes , bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges . 
Madame de T. had not published the memoirs , out of pride , and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how .
