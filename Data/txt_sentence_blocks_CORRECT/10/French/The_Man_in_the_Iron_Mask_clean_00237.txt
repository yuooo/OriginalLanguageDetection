Whenever your loyal , firm , and mailed hand should joined in ties of intimate association the hand of a pope such as I shall be , neither Charles V. , who owned two-thirds of the habitable globe , nor Charlemagne , who possessed it entirely , will be able to reach to half your stature .

`` I say that you render me happy and proud , for no other reason than that of having comprehended you thoroughly .
