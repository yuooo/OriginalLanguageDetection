Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day . 
As the sisters were melancholy and he was kind , the child made comparisons and adored him . 
At the appointed hour she flew to the hut . 
When she entered the lowly cabin , she filled it with paradise . 
Jean Valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded Cosette . 
The joy which we inspire has this charming property , that , far from growing meagre , like all reflections , it returns to us more radiant than ever . 
At recreation hours , Jean Valjean watched her running and playing in the distance , and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest . 
For Cosette laughed now . 
Cosette 's face had even undergone a change , to a certain extent . 
The gloom had disappeared from it .
