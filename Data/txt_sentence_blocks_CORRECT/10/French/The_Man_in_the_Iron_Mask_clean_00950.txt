`` Good ! '' 
said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair . 
`` We have no longer any need of him ; here are reinforcements coming . '' 
In fact , a company of guards , left in the rear by their officers , whom the ardor of the chase had carried away - from seventy-five to eighty men - arrived in good order , led by their captain and the first lieutenant . 
The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers ; and , in language the eloquence of which may be easily imagined , they related the adventure , and asked for aid . 
The captain interrupted them . 
`` Where are your companions ? '' 
demanded he . 
`` Dead ! '' 
`` But there were sixteen of you ! ''
