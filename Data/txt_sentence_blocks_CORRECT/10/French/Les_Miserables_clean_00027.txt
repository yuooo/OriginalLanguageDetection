Sin is a gravitation . '' 
When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly , and growing angry very quickly , `` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
he said , with a smile ; `` to all appearance , this is a great crime which all the world commits . 
These are hypocrisies which have taken fright , and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter . '' 
He was indulgent towards women and poor people , on whom the burden of human society rest . 
He said , `` The faults of women , of children , of the feeble , the indigent , and the ignorant , are the fault of the husbands , the fathers , the masters , the strong , the rich , and the wise . '' 
He said , moreover , `` Teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible ; society is culpable , in that it does not afford instruction gratis ; it is responsible for the night which it produces . 
This soul is full of shadow ; sin is therein committed . 
The guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin , but the person who has created the shadow . ''
