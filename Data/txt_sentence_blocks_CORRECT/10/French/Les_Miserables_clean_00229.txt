Certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape , ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined . 
It is the science of muscles . 
An entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners , men who are forever envious of the flies and birds . 
To climb a vertical surface , and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible , was play to Jean Valjean . 
An angle of the wall being given , with the tension of his back and legs , with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone , he raised himself as if by magic to the third story . 
He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison . 
He spoke but little . 
He laughed not at all . 
An excessive emotion was required to wring from him , once or twice a year , that lugubrious laugh of the convict , which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon . 
To all appearance , he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible .
