From whom ? 
From misery . 
From hunger , cold , isolation , destitution . 
A dolorous bargain . 
A soul for a morsel of bread . 
Misery offers ; society accepts . 
The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization , but it does not , as yet , permeate it ; it is said that slavery has disappeared from European civilization . 
This is a mistake . 
It still exists ; but it weighs only upon the woman , and it is called prostitution . 
It weighs upon the woman , that is to say , upon grace , weakness , beauty , maternity .
