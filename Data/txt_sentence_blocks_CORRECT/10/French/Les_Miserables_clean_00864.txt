In this case one dies within the month . 
Finally , the last method is not to speak to the black man , not to look at him , and to flee at the best speed of one 's legs . 
One then dies within the year . 
As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences , the second , which at all events , presents some advantages , among others that of possessing a treasure , if only for a month , is the one most generally adopted . 
So bold men , who are tempted by every chance , have quite frequently , as we are assured , opened the holes excavated by the black man , and tried to rob the devil . 
The success of the operation appears to be but moderate . 
At least , if the tradition is to be believed , and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin , which an evil Norman monk , a bit of a sorcerer , named Tryphon has left on this subject . 
This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville , near Rouen , and toads spawn on his grave . 
Accordingly , enormous efforts are made . 
Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep ; a man sweats , digs , toils all night -- for it must be done at night ; he wets his shirt , burns out his candle , breaks his mattock , and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole , when he lays his hand on the `` treasure , '' what does he find ?
