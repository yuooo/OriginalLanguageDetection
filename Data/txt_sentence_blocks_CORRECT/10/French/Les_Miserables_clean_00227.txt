He dwelt habitually in this shadow , feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer . 
Only , at intervals , there suddenly came to him , from without and from within , an access of wrath , a surcharge of suffering , a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul , and caused to appear abruptly all around him , in front , behind , amid the gleams of a frightful light , the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny . 
The flash passed , the night closed in again ; and where was he ? 
He no longer knew . 
The peculiarity of pains of this nature , in which that which is pitiless -- that is to say , that which is brutalizing -- predominates , is to transform a man , little by little , by a sort of stupid transfiguration , into a wild beast ; sometimes into a ferocious beast . 
Jean Valjean 's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul . 
Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts , utterly useless and foolish as they were , as often as the opportunity had presented itself , without reflecting for an instant on the result , nor on the experiences which he had already gone through . 
He escaped impetuously , like the wolf who finds his cage open . 
Instinct said to him , `` Flee ! '' 
Reason would have said , `` Remain ! ''
