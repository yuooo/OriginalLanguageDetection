But the inexplicable point , to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain , was that M. Madeleine should be there , and that he should have that little girl with him . 
Fauchelevent saw them , touched them , spoke to them , and still did not believe it possible . 
The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent 's hut . 
Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures , and could see nothing clearly but this : `` M. Madeleine saved my life . '' 
This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course . 
He said to himself : `` It is my turn now . '' 
He added in his conscience : `` M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out . '' 
He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine . 
Nevertheless , he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies : `` After what he did for me , would I save him if he were a thief ? 
Just the same .
