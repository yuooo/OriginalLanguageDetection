If he only does not make a mistake ! 
So you found him at the church ? 
Did he read my letter ? 
What did he say to you ? '' 
`` Ta , ta , ta , '' said the girl , `` how you do gallop on , my good man ! 
See here : I entered the church , he was in his usual place , I made him a reverence , and I handed him the letter ; he read it and said to me : ` Where do you live , my child ? ' 
I said : ` Monsieur , I will show you . ' 
He said to me : ` No , give me your address , my daughter has some purchases to make , I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do . ' 
I gave him the address . 
When I mentioned the house , he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant , then he said : ` Never mind , I will come . '
