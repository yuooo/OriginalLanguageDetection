In this dilemma , Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine in man 's clothes , who now prowled incessantly around the garden . 
Cosette had called to `` this young workman '' and had handed him five francs and the letter , saying : `` Carry this letter immediately to its address . '' 
Eponine had put the letter in her pocket . 
The next day , on the 5th of June , she went to Courfeyrac 's quarters to inquire for Marius , not for the purpose of delivering the letter , but , -- a thing which every jealous and loving soul will comprehend , -- `` to see . '' 
There she had waited for Marius , or at least for Courfeyrac , still for the purpose of seeing . 
When Courfeyrac had told her : `` We are going to the barricades , '' an idea flashed through her mind , to fling herself into that death , as she would have done into any other , and to thrust Marius into it also . 
She had followed Courfeyrac , had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction ; and , quite certain , since Marius had received no warning , and since she had intercepted the letter , that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening , she had betaken herself to the Rue Plumet , had there awaited Marius , and had sent him , in the name of his friends , the appeal which would , she thought , lead him to the barricade . 
She reckoned on Marius ' despair when he should fail to find Cosette ; she was not mistaken . 
She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself . 
What she did there the reader has just seen .
