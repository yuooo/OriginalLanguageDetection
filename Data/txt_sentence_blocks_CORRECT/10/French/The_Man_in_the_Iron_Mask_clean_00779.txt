`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . ''
