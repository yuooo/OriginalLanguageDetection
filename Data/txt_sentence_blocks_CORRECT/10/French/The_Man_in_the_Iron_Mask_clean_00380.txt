No one in France is rich enough to give two millions for Vaux , and to continue to maintain it as I have done ; no one could do it , no one would know how . '' 
`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` in any case , a million is not abject misery . '' 
`` It is not far from it , my dear monsieur . 
But you do not understand me . 
No ; I will not sell my residence at Vaux ; I will give it to you , if you like ; '' and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the shoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice . 
`` Give it to the king ; you will make a better bargain . '' 
`` The king does not require me to give it to him , '' said Fouquet ; `` he will take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace , if it pleases him to do so ; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see it perish . 
Do you know , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that if the king did not happen to be under my roof , I would take this candle , go straight to the dome , and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks which are in reserve there , and would reduce my palace to ashes . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , negligently .
