I will not remain long . 
You shall give orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room . 
On the ground floor . 
I could enter perfectly well by the back door , but that might create surprise perhaps , and it would be better , I think , for me to enter by the usual door . 
Truly , sir , I should like to see a little more of Cosette . 
As rarely as you please . 
Put yourself in my place , I have nothing left but that . 
And then , we must be cautious . 
If I no longer come at all , it would produce a bad effect , it would be considered singular . 
What I can do , by the way , is to come in the afternoon , when night is beginning to fall . ''
