One personage , whose name has remained unknown , announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over , would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people . 
That which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection . 
Here and there , also , in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions , there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said : `` Let us plunder ! '' 
There are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water . 
A phenomenon to which `` well drilled '' policemen are no strangers . 
The procession proceeded , with feverish slowness , from the house of the deceased , by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille . 
It rained from time to time ; the rain mattered nothing to that throng . 
Many incidents , the coffin borne round the Vendome column , stones thrown at the Duc de Fitz-James , who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head , the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire , a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin , an officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud : `` I am a Republican , '' the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home , the shouts of : `` Long live the Polytechnique ! 
Long live the Republic ! '' 
marked the passage of the funeral train .
