Let us make an exception in favor of Paris , nevertheless . 
In a relative measure , and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled , the exception is just . 
While in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man , while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is , in some sort , sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience , the street boy of Paris , we insist on this point , however defaced and injured on the surface , is almost intact on the interior . 
It is a magnificent thing to put on record , and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions , that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of Paris , as salt exists in the water of the ocean . 
To breathe Paris preserves the soul . 
What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family . 
In the civilization of the present day , incomplete as it still is , it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness , not knowing clearly what has become of their children , and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway . 
Hence these obscure destinies . 
This is called , for this sad thing has given rise to an expression , `` to be cast on the pavements of Paris . '' 
Let it be said by the way , that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy .
