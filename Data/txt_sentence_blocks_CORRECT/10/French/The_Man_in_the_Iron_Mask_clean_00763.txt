- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale .
