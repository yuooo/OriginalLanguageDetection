Impossible . 
This is neither a fair nor a market day . 
Have you been to Labarre ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
The traveller replied with embarrassment : `` I do not know . 
He did not receive me . '' 
`` Have you been to What 's - his-name 's , in the Rue Chaffaut ? '' 
The stranger 's embarrassment increased ; he stammered , `` He did not receive me either . ''
