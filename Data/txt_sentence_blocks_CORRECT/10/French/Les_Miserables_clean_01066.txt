Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured . 
One hope remained to him ; it was , that the men had not , perhaps , stepped on the bridge , and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space , holding Cosette by the hand . 
In that case , by plunging into the little street before him , he might escape , if he could reach the timber-yards , the marshes , the market-gardens , the uninhabited ground which was not built upon . 
It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street . 
He entered it .

It separated into two streets , which ran in a slanting line , one to the right , and the other to the left . 
Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y. Which should he choose ? 
He did not hesitate , but took the one on the right . 
Why ?
