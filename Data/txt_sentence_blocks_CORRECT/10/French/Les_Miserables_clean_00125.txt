Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite . 
Their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes , into nice little promotions . 
The larger the diocese of the patron , the fatter the curacy for the favorite . 
And then , there is Rome . 
A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop , an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal , carries you with him as conclavist ; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction , you receive the pallium , and behold ! 
you are an auditor , then a papal chamberlain , then monsignor , and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step , and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot . 
Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara . 
The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner ; and what a king ! 
the supreme king . 
Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary !
