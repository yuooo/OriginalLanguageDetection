Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder , -- an idea struck her . 
If she had been a man , she would have slapped her brow . 
She apostrophized Theodule : -- `` Are you aware whether your cousin knows you ? ''

`` He in the imperial , I in the coupe . '' 
`` Where does this diligence run ? '' 
`` To Andelys . ''
