`` Very good , sire , '' replied the captain , whose glance had for a long time past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance . 
He gave the necessary order at the door ; but , returning to the king , he said , `` Is there something fresh the matter , your majesty ? '' 
`` How many men have you here ? '' 
inquired the king , without making any other reply to the question addressed to him . 
`` What for , sire ? '' 
`` How many men have you , I say ? '' 
repeated the king , stamping upon the ground with his foot . 
`` I have the musketeers . '' 
`` Well ; and what others ? '' 
`` Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss . ''
