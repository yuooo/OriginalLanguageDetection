And they advanced to meet Biscarrat . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the captain , addressing Biscarrat , `` I am assured that you know who the men are in that grotto , and who make such a desperate defense . 
In the king 's name I command you to declare what you know . '' 
`` Captain , '' said Biscarrat , `` you have no need to command me . 
My word has been restored to me this very instant ; and I came in the name of these men . '' 
`` To tell me who they are ? '' 
`` To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death , unless you grant them satisfactory terms . '' 
`` How many are there of them , then ? '' 
`` There are two , '' said Biscarrat . 
`` There are two - and want to impose conditions upon us ? ''
