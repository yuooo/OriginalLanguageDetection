Move about as much as you like ; walk up and down in any part of the room , write , efface , destroy , burn , - nothing like that will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from snoring , but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door , for I should start up in a moment , and that would shake my nerves and make me ill . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said Fouquet , `` you are certainly the most witty and the most courteous man I ever met with ; and you will leave me only one regret , that of having made your acquaintance so late . '' 
D'Artagnan drew a deep sigh , which seemed to say , `` Alas ! 
you have perhaps made it too soon . '' 
He then settled himself in his armchair , while Fouquet , half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm , was meditating on his misadventures . 
In this way , both of them , leaving the candles burning , awaited the first dawn of the day ; and when Fouquet happened to sigh too loudly , D'Artagnan only snored the louder . 
Not a single visit , not even from Aramis , disturbed their quietude : not a sound even was heard throughout the whole vast palace . 
Outside , however , the guards of honor on duty , and the patrol of musketeers , paced up and down ; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel walks . 
It seemed to act as an additional soporific for the sleepers , while the murmuring of the wind through the trees , and the unceasing music of the fountains whose waters tumbled in the basin , still went on uninterruptedly , without being disturbed at the slight noises and items of little moment that constitute the life and death of human nature . 
: The Morning .
