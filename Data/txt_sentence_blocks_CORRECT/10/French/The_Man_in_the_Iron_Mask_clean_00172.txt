`` What ! 
who ? '' 
asked Baisemeaux . 
`` I hope 't is neither the wine you drank nor he who is the cause of your drinking it . '' 
`` No ; it is a horse , who is making noise enough in the court for a whole squadron . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
some courier or other , '' replied the governor , redoubling his attention to the passing bottle . 
`` Yes ; and may the devil take him , and so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more . 
Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! ''
