` Jean Valjean ! 
who 's Jean Valjean ? ' 
Champmathieu feigns astonishment . 
` Do n't play the innocent dodge , ' says Brevet . 
` You are Jean Valjean ! 
You have been in the galleys of Toulon ; it was twenty years ago ; we were there together . ' 
Champmathieu denies it . 
Parbleu ! 
You understand . 
The case is investigated .
