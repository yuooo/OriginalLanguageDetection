It was providence appearing in horrible guise , and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of Thenardier . 
Thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse , drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean . 
`` Hold on , '' said he , `` I 'll give you the rope to boot . '' 
`` What is the rope for ? '' 
`` You will need a stone also , but you can find one outside . 
There 's a heap of rubbish . '' 
`` What am I to do with a stone ? '' 
`` Idiot , you 'll want to sling that stiff into the river , you 'll need a stone and a rope , otherwise it would float on the water . '' 
Jean Valjean took the rope . 
There is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way .
