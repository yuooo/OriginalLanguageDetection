Javert raised his head , saw Jean Valjean , made an almost imperceptible movement , and said : `` That is just . '' 
As for Enjolras , he had begun to re-load his rifle ; he cut his eyes about him : `` No objections . '' 
And he turned to Jean Valjean : `` Take the spy . '' 
Jean Valjean did , in fact , take possession of Javert , by seating himself on the end of the table . 
He seized the pistol , and a faint click announced that he had cocked it . 
Almost at the same moment , a blast of trumpets became audible . 
`` Take care ! '' 
shouted Marius from the top of the barricade . 
Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him , and gazing intently at the insurgents , he said to them : `` You are in no better case than I am . ''
