The man bent his steps towards this inn , which was the best in the country-side . 
He entered the kitchen , which opened on a level with the street . 
All the stoves were lighted ; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace . 
The host , who was also the chief cook , was going from one stew-pan to another , very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners , whose loud talking , conversation , and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment . 
Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners . 
A fat marmot , flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks , was turning on a long spit before the fire ; on the stove , two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking . 
The host , hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter , said , without raising his eyes from his stoves : -- `` What do you wish , sir ? '' 
`` Food and lodging , '' said the man . 
`` Nothing easier , '' replied the host . 
At that moment he turned his head , took in the traveller 's appearance with a single glance , and added , `` By paying for it . ''
