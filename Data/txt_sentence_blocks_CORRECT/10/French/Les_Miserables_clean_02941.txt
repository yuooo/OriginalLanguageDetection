`` Can any one understand , '' exclaimed Feuilly bitterly , `` those men , -- -LSB- and he cited names , well-known names , even celebrated names , some belonging to the old army -RSB- -- who had promised to join us , and taken an oath to aid us , and who had pledged their honor to it , and who are our generals , and who abandon us ! '' 
And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile . 
`` There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the stars , from a great distance . '' 
The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm . 
The assailants had numbers in their favor ; the insurgents had position . 
They were at the top of a wall , and they thundered point-blank upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in the escarpment . 
This barricade , constructed as it was and admirably buttressed , was really one of those situations where a handful of men hold a legion in check . 
Nevertheless , the attacking column , constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets , drew inexorably nearer , and now , little by little , step by step , but surely , the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press . 
One assault followed another . 
The horror of the situation kept increasing .
