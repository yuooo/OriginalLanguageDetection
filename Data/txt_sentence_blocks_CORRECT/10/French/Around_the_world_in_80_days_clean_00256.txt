The detective , at least , seemed to have found a way ; for , after a few moments , he said to Mr. Fogg , `` These are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` but they pass . '' 
`` You were in the habit of playing whist , '' resumed Fix , `` on the steamers . '' 
`` Yes ; but it would be difficult to do so here . 
I have neither cards nor partners . '' 
`` Oh , but we can easily buy some cards , for they are sold on all the American trains . 
And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' Aouda quickly replied ; `` I understand whist . 
It is part of an English education . '' 
`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game . 
Well , here are three of us , and a dummy -- '' `` As you please , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway .
