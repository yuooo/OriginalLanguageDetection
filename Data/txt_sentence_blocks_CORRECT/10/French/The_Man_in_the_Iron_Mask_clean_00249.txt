And D'Artagnan rubbed his forehead - that fertile land , whence the plowshare of his nails had turned up so many and such admirable ideas in his time . 
He , at first , thought of talking the matter over with Colbert , but his friendship for Aramis , the oath of earlier days , bound him too strictly . 
He revolted at the bare idea of such a thing , and , besides , he hated the financier too cordially . 
Then , again , he wished to unburden his mind to the king ; but yet the king would not be able to understand the suspicions which had not even a shadow of reality at their base . 
He resolved to address himself to Aramis , direct , the first time he met him . 
`` I will get him , '' said the musketeer , `` between a couple of candles , suddenly , and when he least expects it , I will place my hand upon his heart , and he will tell me - What will he tell me ? 
Yes , he will tell me something , for mordioux ! 
there is something in it , I know . '' 
Somewhat calmer , D'Artagnan made every preparation for the journey , and took the greatest care that the military household of the king , as yet very inconsiderable in numbers , should be well officered and well disciplined in its meager and limited proportions . 
The result was that , through the captain 's arrangements , the king , on arriving at Melun , saw himself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards , as well as a picket of the French guards .
