`` Mr. Fogg is influenced by no one . 
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ? 
Has he ever read my heart ? 
My friend , he must not be left alone an instant ! 
You say he is going to speak with me this evening ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in England . '' 
`` We shall see , '' replied Aouda , becoming suddenly pensive . 
Throughout this day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- the house in Saville Row was as if uninhabited , and Phileas Fogg , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven . 
Why should he present himself at the Reform ? 
His friends no longer expected him there .
