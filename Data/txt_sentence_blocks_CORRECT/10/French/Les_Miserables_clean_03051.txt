Thenardier , raising his right hand to a level with his forehead , formed with it a shade , then he brought his eyelashes together , by screwing up his eyes , a motion which , in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth , characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man . 
He did not succeed . 
Jean Valjean , as we have just stated , had his back turned to the light , and he was , moreover , so disfigured , so bemired , so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full noonday . 
On the contrary , illuminated by the light from the grating , a cellar light , it is true , livid , yet precise in its lividness , Thenardier , as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it , immediately `` leaped into '' Jean Valjean 's eyes . 
This inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men . 
The encounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled and Thenardier unmasked . 
Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thenardier did not recognize him . 
They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom , as though taking each other 's measure . 
Thenardier was the first to break the silence . 
`` How are you going to manage to get out ? ''
