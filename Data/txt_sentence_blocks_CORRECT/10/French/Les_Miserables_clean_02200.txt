The breeze was blowing briskly in the trees , Cosette was meditating ; an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little , that invincible sadness evoked by the evening , and which arises , perhaps , who knows , from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour . 
Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow . 
Cosette rose , slowly made the tour of the garden , walking on the grass drenched in dew , and saying to herself , through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged : `` Really , one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour . 
One takes cold . '' 
She returned to the bench . 
As she was about to resume her seat there , she observed on the spot which she had quitted , a tolerably large stone which had , evidently , not been there a moment before . 
Cosette gazed at the stone , asking herself what it meant . 
All at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself , that some one had placed it there , that an arm had been thrust through the railing , and this idea appeared to alarm her . 
This time , the fear was genuine ; the stone was there . 
No doubt was possible ; she did not touch it , fled without glancing behind her , took refuge in the house , and immediately closed with shutter , bolt , and bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps .
