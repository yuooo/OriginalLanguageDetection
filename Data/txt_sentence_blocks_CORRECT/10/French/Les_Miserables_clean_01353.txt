She speedily became accustomed to the convent . 
Only she regretted Catherine , but she dared not say so . 
Once , however , she did say to Jean Valjean : `` Father , if I had known , I would have brought her away with me . '' 
Cosette had been obliged , on becoming a scholar in the convent , to don the garb of the pupils of the house . 
Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside . 
This was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the Thenardiers ' inn . 
It was not very threadbare even now . 
Jean Valjean locked up these garments , plus the stockings and the shoes , with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound , in a little valise which he found means of procuring . 
He set this valise on a chair near his bed , and he always carried the key about his person . 
`` Father , '' Cosette asked him one day , `` what is there in that box which smells so good ? ''
