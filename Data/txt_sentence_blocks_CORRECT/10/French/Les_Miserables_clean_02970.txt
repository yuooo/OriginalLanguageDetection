Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves . 
Moreover , and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste , Paris is itself an imitator . 
These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel ; this is no young folly . 
The ancients did like the moderns . 
`` The sewers of Rome , '' says Liebig , `` have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant . '' 
When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer , Rome exhausted Italy , and when she had put Italy in her sewer , she poured in Sicily , then Sardinia , then Africa . 
The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world . 
This cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe . 
Urbi et orbi . 
Eternal city , unfathomable sewer .
