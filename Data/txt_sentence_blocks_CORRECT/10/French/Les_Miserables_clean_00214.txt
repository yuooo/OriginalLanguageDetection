Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang . 
An old turnkey of the prison , who is now nearly eighty years old , still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line , in the north angle of the courtyard . 
He was seated on the ground like the others . 
He did not seem to comprehend his position , except that it was horrible . 
It is probable that he , also , was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man , ignorant of everything , something excessive . 
While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer , he wept , his tears stifled him , they impeded his speech ; he only managed to say from time to time , `` I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles . '' 
Then still sobbing , he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times , as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights , and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done , whatever it was , he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children . 
He set out for Toulon . 
He arrived there , after a journey of twenty-seven days , on a cart , with a chain on his neck . 
At Toulon he was clothed in the red cassock .
