`` It is midday , '' said Combeferre . 
The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to his feet , and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout : `` Carry stones up into the houses ; line the windowsills and the roofs with them . 
Half the men to their guns , the other half to the paving-stones . 
There is not a minute to be lost . '' 
A squad of sappers and miners , axe on shoulder , had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street . 
This could only be the head of a column ; and of what column ? 
The attacking column , evidently ; the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it . 
They were , evidently , on the brink of that moment which M. Clermont-Tonnerre , in 1822 , called `` the tug of war . '' 
Enjolras ' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to ships and barricades , the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible . 
In less than a minute , two thirds of the stones which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic , and before a second minute had elapsed , these stones , artistically set one upon the other , walled up the sash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height .
