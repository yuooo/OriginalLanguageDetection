Here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds , amid the passersby , who formed into circles and applauded , the then celebrated Bourbon air , which was destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning , and which had for its refrain : -- `` Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand , Rendez-nous notre pere . '' 
`` Give us back our father from Ghent , Give us back our father . '' 
Groups of dwellers in the suburbs , in Sunday array , sometimes even decorated with the fleur-de-lys , like the bourgeois , scattered over the large square and the Marigny square , were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses ; others were engaged in drinking ; some journeyman printers had on paper caps ; their laughter was audible . 
Every thing was radiant . 
It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security ; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police Angeles to the King , on the subject of the suburbs of Paris , terminated with these lines : -- `` Taking all things into consideration , Sire , there is nothing to be feared from these people . 
They are as heedless and as indolent as cats . 
The populace is restless in the provinces ; it is not in Paris . 
These are very pretty men , Sire . 
It would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers . 
There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of Paris the capital .
