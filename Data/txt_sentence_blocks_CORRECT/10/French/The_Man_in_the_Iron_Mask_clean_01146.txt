Colbert , in his warmth , forgot himself ; he called the captain simply D'Artagnan , as the king did . 
But the captain only smiled at it . 
`` No , '' replied he , `` I do not know him . '' 
`` That is another man I have discovered , with a genius for buying . 
This Forant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls , 200,000 pounds of powder , twelve cargoes of Northern timber , matches , grenades , pitch , tar - I know not what ! 
with a saving of seven per cent upon what all those articles would cost me fabricated in France . '' 
`` That is a capital and quaint idea , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` to have Dutch cannon-balls cast which will return to the Dutch . '' 
`` Is it not , with loss , too ? '' 
And Colbert laughed aloud . 
He was delighted with his own joke .
