At five and twenty he was bald . 
His father had ended by owning a house and a field ; but he , the son , had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation . 
He had nothing left . 
He possessed knowledge and wit , but all he did miscarried . 
Everything failed him and everybody deceived him ; what he was building tumbled down on top of him . 
If he were splitting wood , he cut off a finger . 
If he had a mistress , he speedily discovered that he had a friend also . 
Some misfortune happened to him every moment , hence his joviality . 
He said : `` I live under falling tiles . '' 
He was not easily astonished , because , for him , an accident was what he had foreseen , he took his bad luck serenely , and smiled at the teasing of fate , like a person who is listening to pleasantries .
