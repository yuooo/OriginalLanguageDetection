Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout 's rash exclamation , which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall . 
`` The facts are admitted ? '' 
asked the judge . 
`` Admitted , '' replied Mr. Fogg , coldly . 
`` Inasmuch , '' resumed the judge , `` as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people , and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill , at Bombay , on the 20th of October , I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds . '' 
`` Three hundred pounds ! '' 
cried Passepartout , startled at the largeness of the sum . 
`` Silence ! '' 
shouted the constable . 
`` And inasmuch , '' continued the judge , `` as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week 's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds .
