`` Now you understand , '' pursued Aramis , `` that the king , who with so much pleasure saw himself repeated in one , was in despair about two ; fearing that the second might dispute the first 's claim to seniority , which had been recognized only two hours before ; and so this second son , relying on party interests and caprices , might one day sow discord and engender civil war throughout the kingdom ; by these means destroying the very dynasty he should have strengthened . '' 
`` Oh , I understand !

`` Except , also , '' Aramis went on , `` the lady in the black dress ; and , finally , excepting - '' `` Excepting yourself - is it not ?
