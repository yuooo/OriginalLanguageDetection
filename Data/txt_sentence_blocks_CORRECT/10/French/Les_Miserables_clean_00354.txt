said Fantine . 
As Fantine concluded this sigh , the waiter who had served them at dinner entered . 
He held in his hand something which resembled a letter . 
`` What is that ? '' 
demanded Favourite . 
The waiter replied : -- `` It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies . '' 
`` Why did you not bring it at once ? '' 
`` Because , '' said the waiter , `` the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour . '' 
Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter 's hand . 
It was , in fact , a letter .
