From time to time , a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface . 
A mysterious wrinkle is formed , then vanishes , then re-appears ; an air-bubble rises and bursts . 
It is the breathing of the unknown beast . 
Certain strange habits : arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave , keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves , preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall-colored mantle , seeking the solitary walk , preferring the deserted street , avoiding any share in conversation , avoiding crowds and festivals , seeming at one 's ease and living poorly , having one 's key in one 's pocket , and one 's candle at the porter 's lodge , however rich one may be , entering by the side door , ascending the private staircase , -- all these insignificant singularities , fugitive folds on the surface , often proceed from a formidable foundation . 
Many weeks passed in this manner . 
A new life gradually took possession of Cosette : the relations which marriage creates , visits , the care of the house , pleasures , great matters . 
Cosette 's pleasures were not costly , they consisted in one thing : being with Marius . 
The great occupation of her life was to go out with him , to remain with him . 
It was for them a joy that was always fresh , to go out arm in arm , in the face of the sun , in the open street , without hiding themselves , before the whole world , both of them completely alone . 
Cosette had one vexation .
