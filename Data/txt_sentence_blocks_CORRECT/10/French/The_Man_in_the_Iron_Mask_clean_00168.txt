`` I have just said , monsieur , that you gave me the idea of a cardinal . '' 
`` Enough , dear M. Baisemeaux . 
As you said , I have on the boots of a cavalier , but I do not intend , for all that , to embroil myself with the church this evening . '' 
`` But you have wicked intentions , nevertheless , monseigneur . '' 
`` Oh , yes , wicked , I own , as everything mundane is . '' 
`` You traverse the town and the streets in disguise ? '' 
`` In disguise , as you say . '' 
`` And you still make use of your sword ? '' 
`` Yes , I should think so ; but only when I am compelled . 
Do me the pleasure to summon Francois . ''
