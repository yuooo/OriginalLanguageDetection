`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? ''
