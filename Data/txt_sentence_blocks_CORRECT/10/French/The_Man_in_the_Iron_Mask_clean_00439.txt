said Fouquet . 
Aramis raised his head gently , and a glimmer of hope might be seen once more to animate his eyes . 
`` Reflect , monseigneur , '' he said , `` upon everything we have to expect . 
As the matter now stands , the king is still alive , and his imprisonment saves your life . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Fouquet , `` you may have been acting on my behalf , but I will not , do not , accept your services . 
But , first of all , I do not wish your ruin . 
You will leave this house . '' 
Aramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart . 
`` I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof , '' continued Fouquet , with an air of inexpressible majesty ; `` you will not be more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated . '' 
`` You will be so , '' said Aramis , in a hoarse , prophetic voice , `` you will be so , believe me . ''
