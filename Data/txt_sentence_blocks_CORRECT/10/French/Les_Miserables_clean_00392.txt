However , his coming had been a boon , and his presence was a godsend . 
Before Father Madeleine 's arrival , everything had languished in the country ; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil .

There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it ; no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it . 
Father Madeleine gave employment to every one . 
He exacted but one thing : Be an honest man .
