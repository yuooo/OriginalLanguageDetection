As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure , the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream , and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare , he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets . 
It was no longer snowing ; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist , and its light , mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen , communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect . 
There was a light in the Jondrette den . 
Marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him . 
It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle . 
However , there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters , not a soul was moving there , not a soul speaking , not a breath ; the silence was glacial and profound , and had it not been for that light , he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre . 
Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed . 
Several minutes elapsed . 
Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges ; a heavy step mounted the staircase , and hastened along the corridor ; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted ; it was Jondrette returning . 
Instantly , several voices arose .
