`` The beginning of retreat ! '' 
cried Napoleon . 
NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR The Emperor , though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble , had never been in a better humor than on that day . 
His impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning . 
On the 18th of June , that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly . 
The man who had been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo . 
The greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes . 
Our joys are composed of shadow . 
The supreme smile is God 's alone . 
Ridet Caesar , Pompeius flebit , said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix Legion .
