The grenadiers of the two regiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch their grenades , which had but small effect . 
In the meanwhile , M. d'Estrees , who commanded the fleet , having seen the attempt of the sergeant to approach the vessels , understood that he must act without orders , and opened fire . 
Then the Arabs , finding themselves seriously injured by the balls from the fleet , and beholding the destruction and the ruin of their walls , uttered the most fearful cries . 
Their horsemen descended the mountain at a gallop , bent over their saddles , and rushed full tilt upon the columns of infantry , which , crossing their pikes , stopped this mad assault . 
Repulsed by the firm attitude of the battalion , the Arabs threw themselves with fury towards the etat-major , which was not on its guard at that moment . 
`` The danger was great ; monseigneur drew his sword ; his secretaries and people imitated him ; the officers of the suite engaged in combat with the furious Arabs . 
It was then M. de Bragelonne was able to satisfy the inclination he had so clearly shown from the commencement of the action . 
He fought near the prince with the valor of a Roman , and killed three Arabs with his small sword . 
But it was evident that his bravery did not arise from that sentiment of pride so natural to all who fight . 
It was impetuous , affected , even forced ; he sought to glut , intoxicate himself with strife and carnage .
