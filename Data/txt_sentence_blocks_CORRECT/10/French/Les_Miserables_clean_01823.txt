Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace , and drew from it an old cap , which he placed on his head , after brushing it with his sleeve . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` I 'm going out . 
I have some more people that I must see . 
Good ones . 
You 'll see how well the whole thing will work . 
I shall be away as short a time as possible , it 's a fine stroke of business , do you look after the house . '' 
And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers , he stood for a moment in thought , then exclaimed : -- `` Do you know , it 's mighty lucky , by the way , that he did n't recognize me ! 
If he had recognized me on his side , he would not have come back again . 
He would have slipped through our fingers ! 
It was my beard that saved us !
