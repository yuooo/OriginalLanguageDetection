`` No . '' 
`` I will come back to America to find him , '' said Phileas Fogg calmly . 
`` It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way , without retaliating . '' 
The detective smiled , but did not reply . 
It was clear that Mr. Fogg was one of those Englishmen who , while they do not tolerate duelling at home , fight abroad when their honour is attacked . 
At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station , and found the train ready to depart . 
As he was about to enter it , Mr. Fogg called a porter , and said to him : `` My friend , was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco ? '' 
`` It was a political meeting , sir , '' replied the porter . 
`` But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets . '' 
`` It was only a meeting assembled for an election . ''
