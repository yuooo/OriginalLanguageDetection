`` You are sure of that ? '' 
`` Perfectly . '' 
`` And when does the boat leave Shanghai ? '' 
`` On the 11th , at seven in the evening . 
We have , therefore , four days before us , that is ninety-six hours ; and in that time , if we had good luck and a south-west wind , and the sea was calm , we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai . '' 
`` And you could go -- '' `` In an hour ; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up . '' 
`` It is a bargain . 
Are you the master of the boat ? '' 
`` Yes ; John Bunsby , master of the Tankadere . '' 
`` Would you like some earnest-money ? ''
