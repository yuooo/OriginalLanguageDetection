He put this document for conviction in his pocket . 
After which he opened the grating , made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back , closed the grating again , and ran off , not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all , not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river . 
Now you comprehend . 
The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean ; the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment ; and the piece of the coat ... '' Thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket , and holding , on a level with his eyes , nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers , a strip of torn black cloth , all covered with dark spots . 
Marius had sprung to his feet , pale , hardly able to draw his breath , with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth , and , without uttering a word , without taking his eyes from that fragment , he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney . 
He found the key , opened the cupboard , plunged his arm into it without looking , and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which Thenardier still held outspread . 
But Thenardier continued : `` Monsieur le Baron , I have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by Jean Valjean , and the bearer of an enormous sum of money . '' 
`` The young man was myself , and here is the coat ! '' 
cried Marius , and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood . 
Then , snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier , he crouched down over the coat , and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt .
