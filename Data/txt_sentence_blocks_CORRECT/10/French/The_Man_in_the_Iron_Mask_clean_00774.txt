`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . ''
