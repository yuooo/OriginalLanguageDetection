`` And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` That is well known . '' 
`` What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed against a man who will have spent everything he had to please him ? '' 
`` True , true , '' said D'Artagnan , slowly , hardly convinced , yet curious to broach another phase of the conversation . 
`` There are follies , and follies , '' he resumed , `` and I do not like those you are committing . '' 
`` What do you allude to ? '' 
`` As for the banquet , the ball , the concert , the theatricals , the tournaments , the cascades , the fireworks , the illuminations , and the presents - these are well and good , I grant ; but why were not these expenses sufficient ? 
Why was it necessary to have new liveries and costumes for your whole household ? '' 
`` You are quite right . 
I told M. Fouquet that myself ; he replied , that if he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau , from the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars ; completely new inside and out ; and that , as soon as the king had left , he would burn the whole building and its contents , in order that it might not be made use of by any one else .
