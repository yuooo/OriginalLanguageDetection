The steamer was forced to proceed slowly , and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time , and more if the storm lasted . 
Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . 
He never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the Yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . 
But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . 
Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him . 
Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . 
The storm greatly pleased him . 
His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . 
Each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . 
It mattered not that they made him sea-sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .
