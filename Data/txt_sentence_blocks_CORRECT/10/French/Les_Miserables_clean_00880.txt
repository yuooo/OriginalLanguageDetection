At that moment the crowd broke into applause : old convict-sergeants among them wept , and women embraced each other on the quay , and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage , `` Pardon for that man ! '' 
He , in the meantime , had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin his detachment . 
In order to reach them the more speedily , he dropped into the rigging , and ran along one of the lower yards ; all eyes were following him . 
At a certain moment fear assailed them ; whether it was that he was fatigued , or that his head turned , they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger . 
All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout : the convict had fallen into the sea . 
The fall was perilous . 
The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside the Orion , and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels : it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them . 
Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat ; the crowd cheered them on ; anxiety again took possession of all souls ; the man had not risen to the surface ; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple , as though he had fallen into a cask of oil : they sounded , they dived . 
In vain . 
The search was continued until the evening : they did not even find the body .
