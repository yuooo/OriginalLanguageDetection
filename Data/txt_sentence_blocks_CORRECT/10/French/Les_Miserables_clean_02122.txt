With faith in her beauty , the whole feminine soul expanded within her . 
She conceived a horror for her merinos , and shame for her plush hat . 
Her father had never refused her anything . 
She at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet , the gown , the mantle , the boot , the cuff , the stuff which is in fashion , the color which is becoming , that science which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming , so deep , and so dangerous . 
The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne . 
In less than a month , little Cosette , in that Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone , was not only one of the prettiest , but one of the `` best dressed '' women in Paris , which means a great deal more . 
She would have liked to encounter her `` passer-by , '' to see what he would say , and to `` teach him a lesson ! '' 
The truth is , that she was ravishing in every respect , and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way . 
Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety . 
He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl , walk at the most , beheld wings sprouting on Cosette .
