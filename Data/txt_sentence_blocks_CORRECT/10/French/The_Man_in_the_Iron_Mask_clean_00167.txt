I like exceedingly to be tete-a - tete when I am with a friend . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed respectfully . 
`` I like exceedingly , '' continued Aramis , `` to help myself . '' 
`` Retire , Francois , '' cried Baisemeaux . 
`` I was saying that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons ; one very illustrious , the late cardinal , the great Cardinal de la Rochelle , who wore boots like you . '' 
`` Indeed , '' said Aramis ; `` and the other ? '' 
`` The other was a certain musketeer , very handsome , very brave , very adventurous , very fortunate , who , from being abbe , turned musketeer , and from musketeer turned abbe . '' 
Aramis condescended to smile . 
`` From abbe , '' continued Baisemeaux , encouraged by Aramis 's smile - `` from abbe , bishop - and from bishop - '' `` Ah ! 
stay there , I beg , '' exclaimed Aramis .
