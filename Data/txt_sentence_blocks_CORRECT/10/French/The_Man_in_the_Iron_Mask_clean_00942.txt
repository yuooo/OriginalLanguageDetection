`` Messieurs , '' said one of the young men , `` there is in that which is going on , in the paleness and silence of our friend , a mystery which Biscarrat will not , or can not reveal . 
Only , and this is certain , Biscarrat has seen something in the grotto . 
Well , for my part , I am very curious to see what it is , even if it is the devil ! 
To the grotto ! 
messieurs , to the grotto ! '' 
`` To the grotto ! '' 
repeated all the voices . 
And the echo of the cavern carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis , `` To the grotto ! 
to the grotto ! '' 
Biscarrat threw himself before his companions .
