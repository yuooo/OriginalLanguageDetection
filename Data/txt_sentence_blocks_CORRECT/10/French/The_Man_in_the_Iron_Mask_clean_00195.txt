`` It is true , but it may - '' `` Be forged , you mean ? '' 
`` That is evident , monseigneur . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` I see it plain enough on the order ; but for the same reason that the king 's signature may have been forged , so also , and with even greater probability , may M. de Lyonne 's . '' 
`` Your logic has the stride of a giant , M. de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and your reasoning is irresistible . 
But on what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are false ? '' 
`` On this : the absence of counter-signatures . 
Nothing checks his majesty 's signature ; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has signed . '' 
`` Well , Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , bending an eagle glance on the governor , `` I adopt so frankly your doubts , and your mode of clearing them up , that I will take a pen , if you will give me one . ''
