he demanded . 
`` Forty sous . '' 
`` I will pay on my return . '' 
The driver 's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip up his horse . 
Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air . 
For the lack of four and twenty sous , he was losing his joy , his happiness , his love ! 
He had seen , and he was becoming blind again . 
He reflected bitterly , and it must be confessed , with profound regret , on the five francs which he had bestowed , that very morning , on that miserable girl . 
If he had had those five francs , he would have been saved , he would have been born again , he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness , he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen , from his widowed state ; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread , which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant , once more ! 
He returned to his hovel in despair .
