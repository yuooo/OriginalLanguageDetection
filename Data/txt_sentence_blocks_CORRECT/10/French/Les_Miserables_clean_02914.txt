Jean Valjean continued : `` I do not think that I shall escape from this place . 
But if , by chance , I do , I live , under the name of Fauchelevent , in the Rue de l'Homme Arme , No. 7 . '' 
Javert snarled like a tiger , which made him half open one corner of his mouth , and he muttered between his teeth : `` Have a care . '' 
`` Go , '' said Jean Valjean . 
Javert began again : `` Thou saidst Fauchelevent , Rue de l'Homme Arme ? '' 
`` Number 7 . '' 
Javert repeated in a low voice : -- `` Number 7 . '' 
He buttoned up his coat once more , resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders , made a half turn , folded his arms and , supporting his chin on one of his hands , he set out in the direction of the Halles . 
Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes : A few minutes later , Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean : `` You annoy me . 
Kill me , rather . ''
