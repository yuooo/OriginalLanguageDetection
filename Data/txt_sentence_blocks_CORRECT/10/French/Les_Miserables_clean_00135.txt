Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe ! 
He thought of the grandeur and presence of God ; of the future eternity , that strange mystery ; of the eternity past , a mystery still more strange ; of all the infinities , which pierced their way into all his senses , beneath his eyes ; and , without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible , he gazed upon it . 
He did not study God ; he was dazzled by him . 
He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms , which communicate aspects to matter , reveal forces by verifying them , create individualities in unity , proportions in extent , the innumerable in the infinite , and , through light , produce beauty . 
These conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly ; hence life and death . 
He seated himself on a wooden bench , with his back against a decrepit vine ; he gazed at the stars , past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees . 
This quarter of an acre , so poorly planted , so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds , was dear to him , and satisfied his wants . 
What more was needed by this old man , who divided the leisure of his life , where there was so little leisure , between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night ? 
Was not this narrow enclosure , with the heavens for a ceiling , sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works , in turn ? 
Does not this comprehend all , in fact ?
