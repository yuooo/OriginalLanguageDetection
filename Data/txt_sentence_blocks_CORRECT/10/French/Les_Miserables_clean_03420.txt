All this belonged to the statesman , the ex-ambassador . 
This whole costume was , if we may so express ourselves , debilitated ; the seams were white , a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows ; moreover , one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast ; but this was only detail ; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart , its function was to conceal the absent button . 
If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris , he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basque had just shown in , the statesman 's suit borrowed from the pick-me-down-that shop of the Changer . 
Marius ' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the newcomer 's disadvantage . 
He surveyed him from head to foot , while that personage made exaggerated bows , and demanded in a curt tone : `` What do you want ? '' 
The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea : `` It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor of seeing Monsieur le Baron in society . 
I think I actually did meet monsieur personally , several years ago , at the house of Madame la Princesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte Dambray , peer of France . '' 
It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know . 
Marius paid attention to the manner of this man 's speech . 
He spied on his accent and gesture , but his disappointment increased ; the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry , shrill tone which he had expected .
