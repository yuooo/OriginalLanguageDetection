Then she scrutinized Marius , assumed a singular air and said : -- `` Do you know , Mr. Marius , that you are a very handsome fellow ? '' 
And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both , and made her smile and him blush . 
She stepped up to him , and laid her hand on his shoulder : `` You pay no heed to me , but I know you , Mr. Marius . 
I meet you here on the staircase , and then I often see you going to a person named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz , sometimes when I have been strolling in that quarter . 
It is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus . '' 
She tried to render her voice soft , but only succeeded in making it very deep . 
A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips , as though on a piano where some notes are missing . 
Marius had retreated gently . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' said he , with his cool gravity , `` I have here a package which belongs to you , I think . 
Permit me to return it to you . ''
