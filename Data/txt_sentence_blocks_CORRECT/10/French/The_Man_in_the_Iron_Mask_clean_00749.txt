`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . ''
