M. Gillenormand , without however acknowledging it to himself , for it would have rendered him furious and ashamed , had never loved a mistress as he loved Marius . 
He had had placed in his chamber , opposite the head of his bed , so that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking , an old portrait of his other daughter , who was dead , Madame Pontmercy , a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen . 
He gazed incessantly at that portrait . 
One day , he happened to say , as he gazed upon it : -- `` I think the likeness is strong . '' 
`` To my sister ? '' 
inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand . 
`` Yes , certainly . '' 
`` The old man added : -- `` And to him also . '' 
Once as he sat with his knees pressed together , and his eyes almost closed , in a despondent attitude , his daughter ventured to say to him : -- `` Father , are you as angry with him as ever ? '' 
She paused , not daring to proceed further .
