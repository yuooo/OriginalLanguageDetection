`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how - do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! ''
