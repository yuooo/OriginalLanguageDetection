THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day . 
Every evening , at twilight , he walked for an hour or two , sometimes alone , often with Cosette , seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard , and entering churches at nightfall . 
He liked to go to Saint-Medard , which is the nearest church . 
When he did not take Cosette with him , she remained with the old woman ; but the child 's delight was to go out with the good man . 
She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-tetes with Catherine . 
He held her hand as they walked , and said sweet things to her . 
It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person . 
The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market . 
They lived soberly , always having a little fire , but like people in very moderate circumstances . 
Jean Valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day ; he had merely had the glass door leading to Cosette 's dressing-room replaced by a solid door .
