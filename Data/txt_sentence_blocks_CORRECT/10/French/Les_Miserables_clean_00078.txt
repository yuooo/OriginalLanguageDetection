He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters , nor night . 
Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers . 
He would not take us . 
He was absent for a fortnight . 
On his return nothing had happened to him ; he was thought to be dead , but was perfectly well , and said , `` This is the way I have been robbed ! '' 
And then he opened a trunk full of jewels , all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun , which the thieves had given him . 
When he returned on that occasion , I could not refrain from scolding him a little , taking care , however , not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise , so that no one might hear me . 
At first I used to say to myself , `` There are no dangers which will stop him ; he is terrible . '' 
Now I have ended by getting used to it . 
I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him .
