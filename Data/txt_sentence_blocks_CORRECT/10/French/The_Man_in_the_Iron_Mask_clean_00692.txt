`` Upon your cash-box ? '' 
asked the musketeer . 
`` No , monsieur ; on that of M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan was surprised , but he took the order , which was in the king 's own writing , and was for two hundred pistoles . 
`` What ! '' 
thought he , after having politely thanked M. Brienne 's clerk , `` M. Fouquet is to pay for the journey , then ! 
Mordioux ! 
that is a bit of pure Louis XI . 
Why was not this order on the chest of M. Colbert ? 
He would have paid it with such joy . ''
