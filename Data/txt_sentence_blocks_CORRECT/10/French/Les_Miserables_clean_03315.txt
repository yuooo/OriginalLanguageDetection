`` You are my beloved Cosette ! 
Impossible . '' 
`` Impossible ! '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Very good , '' said Cosette . 
`` I was going to tell you some news . 
I could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep , that your aunt is at mass , that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent 's room smokes , that Nicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep , that Toussaint and Nicolette have already quarrelled , that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint 's stammer . 
Well , you shall know nothing . 
Ah ! 
it is impossible ?
