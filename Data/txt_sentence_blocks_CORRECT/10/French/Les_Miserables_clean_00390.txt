He was a stranger in the Department . 
Of his origin , nothing was known ; of the beginning of his career , very little . 
It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money , a few hundred francs at the most . 
It was from this slender capital , enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea , developed by method and thought , that he had drawn his own fortune , and the fortune of the whole countryside . 
On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments , the appearance , and the language of a workingman . 
It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of M. sur M. , just at nightfall , on a December evening , knapsack on back and thorn club in hand , a large fire had broken out in the town-hall . 
This man had rushed into the flames and saved , at the risk of his own life , two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie ; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport . 
Afterwards they had learned his name . 
He was called Father Madeleine . 
MADELEINE He was a man about fifty years of age , who had a preoccupied air , and who was good .
