The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat , a gesture characteristic of the vulture , and replied with an augmented smile . 
`` Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter ? ''

He had seen the writing rather than read the letter . 
He could hardly recall it . 
But a moment ago a fresh start had been given him . 
He had noted that detail : `` my spouse and my young lady . ''
