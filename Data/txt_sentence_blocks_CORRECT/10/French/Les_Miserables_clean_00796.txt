The cuirassiers replied by crushing them . 
Their great horses reared , strode across the ranks , leaped over the bayonets and fell , gigantic , in the midst of these four living wells . 
The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers ; the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares . 
Files of men disappeared , ground to dust under the horses . 
The bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs ; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else . 
The squares , wasted by this mad cavalry , closed up their ranks without flinching . 
Inexhaustible in the matter of grape-shot , they created explosions in their assailants ' midst . 
The form of this combat was monstrous . 
These squares were no longer battalions , they were craters ; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry , they were a tempest . 
Each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud ; lava contended with lightning .
