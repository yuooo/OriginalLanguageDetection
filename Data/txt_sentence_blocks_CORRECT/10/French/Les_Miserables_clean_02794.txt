No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus ; he was some unknown blouse-wearer , a stranger , a man forgotten , a passing hero , that great anonymous , always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who , at a given moment , utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word , and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute , in a lightning flash , the people and God . 
This inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the 6th of June , 1832 , that , almost at the very same hour , on the barricade Saint-Merry , the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the case : -- `` What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not ? 
Let us get ourselves killed here , to the very last man . '' 
As the reader sees , the two barricades , though materially isolated , were in communication with each other . 
MINUS FIVE , PLUS ONE After the man who decreed the `` protest of corpses '' had spoken , and had given this formula of their common soul , there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry , funereal in sense and triumphant in tone : `` Long live death ! 
Let us all remain here ! '' 
`` Why all ? '' 
said Enjolras . 
`` All ! 
All ! ''
