`` Captain , for Heaven 's sake be calm with the king ! '' 
`` Ah !

said D'Artagnan , throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres . 
`` I have been told that you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers . 
This strikes me as a splendid opportunity . '' 
`` I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it , captain . '' 
`` And why not , pray ? ''
