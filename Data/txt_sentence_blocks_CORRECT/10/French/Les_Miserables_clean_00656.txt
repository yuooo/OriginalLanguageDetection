This knob , which was round and of polished brass , shone like a terrible star for him . 
He gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger . 
He could not take his eyes from it . 
From time to time he advanced a step and approached the door . 
Had he listened , he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur ; but he did not listen , and he did not hear . 
Suddenly , without himself knowing how it happened , he found himself near the door ; he grasped the knob convulsively ; the door opened . 
He was in the court-room . 
A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION He advanced a pace , closed the door mechanically behind him , and remained standing , contemplating what he saw . 
It was a vast and badly lighted apartment , now full of uproar , now full of silence , where all the apparatus of a criminal case , with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng , was in process of development . 
At the one end of the hall , the one where he was , were judges , with abstracted air , in threadbare robes , who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids ; at the other end , a ragged crowd ; lawyers in all sorts of attitudes ; soldiers with hard but honest faces ; ancient , spotted woodwork , a dirty ceiling , tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green ; doors blackened by handmarks ; tap-room lamps which emitted more smoke than light , suspended from nails in the wainscot ; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks ; darkness , ugliness , sadness ; and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression , for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law , and that grand divine thing which is called justice .
