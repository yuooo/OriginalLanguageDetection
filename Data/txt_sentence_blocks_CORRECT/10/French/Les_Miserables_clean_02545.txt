`` Ah , that 's true , '' replied the rag-picker , with deference , `` I have a profession . '' 
A pause succeeded , and the rag-picker , yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man , added : -- `` In the morning , on my return home , I pick over my basket , I sort my things . 
This makes heaps in my room . 
I put the rags in a basket , the cores and stalks in a bucket , the linen in my cupboard , the woollen stuff in my commode , the old papers in the corner of the window , the things that are good to eat in my bowl , the bits of glass in my fireplace , the old shoes behind my door , and the bones under my bed . '' 
Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening . 
`` Old ladies , '' said he , `` what do you mean by talking politics ? '' 
He was assailed by a broadside , composed of a quadruple howl . 
`` Here 's another rascal . '' 
`` What 's that he 's got in his paddle ? 
A pistol ? ''
