She often chatted with Passepartout , who did not fail to perceive the state of the lady 's heart ; and , being the most faithful of domestics , he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg 's honesty , generosity , and devotion . 
He took pains to calm Aouda 's doubts of a successful termination of the journey , telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed , that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of Japan and China , and were fairly on their way to civilised places again . 
A railway train from San Francisco to New York , and a transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon . 
On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama , Phileas Fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . 
The General Grant passed , on the 23rd of November , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of London . 
Mr. Fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left . 
But , though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden , from Aden to Bombay , from Calcutta to Singapore , and from Singapore to Yokohama . 
Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of London , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty-six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of November , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . 
And now the course was a straight one , and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way ! 
It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that Passepartout made a joyful discovery .
