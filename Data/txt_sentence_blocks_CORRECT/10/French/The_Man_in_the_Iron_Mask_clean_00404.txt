`` His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping , after having been greatly fatigued during the whole night . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , who could not understand how the bishop of Vannes , who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening , had become in half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune that had ever sprung up in a sovereign 's bedroom . 
In fact , to transmit the orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch 's room , to serve as an intermediary of Louis XIV . 
so as to be able to give a single order in his name at a couple paces from him , he must have become more than Richelieu had ever been to Louis XIII . 
D'Artagnan 's expressive eye , half - opened lips , his curling mustache , said as much indeed in the plainest language to the chief favorite , who remained calm and perfectly unmoved . 
`` Moreover , '' continued the bishop , `` you will be good enough , monsieur le capitaine des mousquetaires , to allow those only to pass into the king 's room this morning who have special permission . 
His majesty does not wish to be disturbed just yet . '' 
`` But , '' objected D'Artagnan , almost on the point of refusing to obey this order , and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions which the king 's silence had aroused - `` but , monsieur l'eveque , his majesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning . '' 
`` Later , later , '' said the king 's voice , from the bottom of the alcove ; a voice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer 's veins .
