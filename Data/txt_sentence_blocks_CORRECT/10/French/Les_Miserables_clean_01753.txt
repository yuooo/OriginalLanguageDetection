Caverns are better than hovels . 
What Marius now beheld was a hovel . 
Marius was poor , and his chamber was poverty-stricken , but as his poverty was noble , his garret was neat . 
The den upon which his eye now rested was abject , dirty , fetid , pestiferous , mean , sordid . 
The only furniture consisted of a straw chair , an infirm table , some old bits of crockery , and in two of the corners , two indescribable pallets ; all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes , draped with spiders ' webs . 
Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom . 
The walls had a leprous aspect , and were covered with seams and scars , like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady ; a repulsive moisture exuded from them . 
Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them . 
The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement ; this one was neither tiled nor planked ; its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel , which had grown black under the long-continued pressure of feet . 
Upon this uneven floor , where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted , and which possessed but one virginity , that of the broom , were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes , socks , and repulsive rags ; however , this room had a fireplace , so it was let for forty francs a year .
