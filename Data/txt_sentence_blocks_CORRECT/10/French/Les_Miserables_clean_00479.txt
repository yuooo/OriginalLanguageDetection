O Monsieur Javert ! 
it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free , was it not ? 
Make inquiries , speak to my landlord ; I am paying my rent now ; they will tell you that I am perfectly honest . 
Ah ! 
my God ! 
I beg your pardon ; I have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove , and it has made it smoke . '' 
M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention . 
While she was speaking , he fumbled in his waistcoat , drew out his purse and opened it . 
It was empty . 
He put it back in his pocket .
