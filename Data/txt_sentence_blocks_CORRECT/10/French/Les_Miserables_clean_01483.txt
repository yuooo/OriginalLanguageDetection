The gayety of Geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther . 
So long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both , Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge . 
When the bridge fell , an abyss was formed . 
And then , over and above all , Marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt , when he reflected that it was M. Gillenormand who had , from stupid motives , torn him ruthlessly from the colonel , thus depriving the father of the child , and the child of the father . 
By dint of pity for his father , Marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather . 
Nothing of this sort , however , was betrayed on the exterior , as we have already said . 
Only he grew colder and colder ; laconic at meals , and rare in the house . 
When his aunt scolded him for it , he was very gentle and alleged his studies , his lectures , the examinations , etc. , as a pretext . 
His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis : `` In love ! 
I know all about it . ''
