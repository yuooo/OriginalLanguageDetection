During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit . 
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft ! 
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank . 
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr. Fogg said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir . 
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December . 
I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool -- '' `` And I did well ! '' 
cried Andrew Speedy ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! '' 
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , Captain -- '' `` Fogg . '' 
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the Yankee about you . '' 
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr. Fogg said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? ''
