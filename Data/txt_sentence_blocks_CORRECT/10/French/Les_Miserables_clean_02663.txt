THE EXTREME EDGE Marius had reached the Halles . 
There everything was still calmer , more obscure and more motionless than in the neighboring streets . 
One would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens . 
Nevertheless , a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the Saint-Eustache side .

It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees , and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Precheurs . 
He entered it .
