Before revealing the important matters I still withhold , be assured I am in need of some encouragement , if not candor ; a little sympathy , if not confidence . 
But you keep yourself intrenched in a pretended which paralyzes me .

`` Yes , '' said the young man ; `` I once asked the name of this cavalier , and they told me that he called himself the Abbe d'Herblay . 
I was astonished that the abbe had so warlike an air , and they replied that there was nothing singular in that , seeing that he was one of Louis XIII .
