Marigny , the brother of the Pompadour , had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise . 
In spite of ? 
No , because . 
Du Barry , the god-father of the Vaubernier , was very welcome at the house of M. le Marechal de Richelieu .

The Comte de Lamothe , who , in 1815 , was an old man seventy-five years of age , had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air , his cold and angular face , his perfectly polished manners , his coat buttoned up to his cravat , and his long legs always crossed in long , flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna . 
His face was the same color as his trousers . 
This M. de Lamothe was `` held in consideration '' in this salon on account of his `` celebrity '' and , strange to say , though true , because of his name of Valois .
