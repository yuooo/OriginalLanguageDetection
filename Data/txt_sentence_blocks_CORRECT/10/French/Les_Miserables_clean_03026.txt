The Grand Sewer , which is , it must be remembered , nothing else than the old brook of Menilmontant , terminates , if one ascends it , in a blind sack , that is to say , at its ancient point of departure which was its source , at the foot of the knoll of Menilmontant . 
There is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier Popincourt , and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer above the ancient Isle Louviers . 
This branch , which completes the collecting sewer , is separated from it , under the Rue Menilmontant itself , by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters , between upstream and downstream . 
If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived , after a thousand efforts , and broken down with fatigue , and in an expiring condition , in the gloom , at a wall . 
He would have been lost . 
In case of necessity , by retracing his steps a little way , and entering the passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire , on condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat , and by taking the corridor Saint-Louis , then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left , then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery , he might have reached the Amelot sewer , and thence , provided that he did not go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille , he might have attained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal . 
But in order to do this , he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings . 
Now , we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing ; and had any one asked him in what he was , he would have answered : `` In the night . '' 
His instinct served him well . 
To descend was , in fact , possible safety .
