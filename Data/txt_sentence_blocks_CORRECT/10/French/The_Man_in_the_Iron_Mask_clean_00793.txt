D'Artagnan picked up one of these morsels of paper as he descended . 
`` Gourville 's pretty little hand ! '' 
cried he , whilst examining one of the fragments of the note ; `` I was not mistaken . '' 
And he read the word `` horse . '' 
`` Stop ! '' 
said he ; and he examined another , upon which there was not a letter traced . 
Upon a third he read the word `` white ; '' `` white horse , '' repeated he , like a child that is spelling . 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
cried the suspicious spirit , `` a white horse ! '' 
And , like that grain of powder which , burning , dilates into ten thousand times its volume , D'Artagnan , enlightened by ideas and suspicions , rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace .
