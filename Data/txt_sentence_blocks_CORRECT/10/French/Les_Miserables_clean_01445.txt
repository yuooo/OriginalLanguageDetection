a few greenhorns perhaps ? '' 
The Abbe Letourneur , preacher to the King , the Abbe Frayssinous , who was not , as yet , either count , or bishop , or minister , or peer , and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing , and the Abbe Keravenant , Cure of Saint-Germain-des-Pres ; also the Pope 's Nuncio , then Monsignor Macchi , Archbishop of Nisibi , later on Cardinal , remarkable for his long , pensive nose , and another Monsignor , entitled thus : Abbate Palmieri , domestic prelate , one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See , Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica , Advocate of the saints , Postulatore dei Santi , which refers to matters of canonization , and signifies very nearly : Master of Requests of the section of Paradise . 
Lastly , two cardinals , M. de la Luzerne , and M. de Cl ****** T ******* . 
The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have , a few years later , the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand ; M. de Cl ****** T ******* was Archbishop of Toul **** , and often made trips to Paris , to his nephew , the Marquis de T ******* , who was Minister of Marine and War . 
The Cardinal of Cl ****** T ******* was a merry little man , who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock ; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopaedia , and his desperate play at billiards , and persons who , at that epoch , passed through the Rue M ***** on summer evenings , where the hotel de Cl ****** T ******* then stood , halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist , Monseigneur Cotiret , Bishop in partibus of Caryste : `` Mark , Abbe , I make a cannon . '' 
The Cardinal de Cl ****** T ******* had been brought to Madame de T. 's by his most intimate friend , M. de Roquelaure , former Bishop of Senlis , and one of the Forty . 
M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy ; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings , the curious could , on every Tuesday , contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis , usually standing erect , freshly powdered , in violet hose , with his back turned to the door , apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar . 
All these ecclesiastics , though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen , added to the gravity of the T. salon , whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France , the Marquis de Vib **** , the Marquis de Tal *** , the Marquis de Herb ******* , the Vicomte Damb *** , and the Duc de Val ******** . 
This Duc de Val ******** , although Prince de Mon *** , that is to say a reigning prince abroad , had so high an idea of France and its peerage , that he viewed everything through their medium . 
It was he who said : `` The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome ; the lords are the peers of France of England . ''
