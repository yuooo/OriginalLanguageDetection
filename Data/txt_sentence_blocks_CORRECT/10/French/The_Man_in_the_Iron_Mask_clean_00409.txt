How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king , you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life ? '' 
`` From a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis , `` I can not conceal anything . '' 
`` Ah ! 
very good , tell me , then . '' 
`` Very well . 
You think that I have seen the king only twice , whilst the fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times ; only we have kept it very secret , that is all . '' 
And without trying to remove the color which at this revelation made D'Artagnan 's face flush scarlet , Aramis turned towards M. Fouquet , who was as much surprised as the musketeer . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , `` the king desires me to inform you that he is more than ever your friend , and that your beautiful fete , so generously offered by you on his behalf , has touched him to the very heart . '' 
And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner , that the latter , incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so prodigious a character , remained incapable of uttering a single syllable , and equally incapable of thought or movement . 
D'Artagnan fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to each other , and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door , when he feels his presence is an inconvenience for others ; but his eager curiosity , spurred on by so many mysteries , counseled him to remain .
