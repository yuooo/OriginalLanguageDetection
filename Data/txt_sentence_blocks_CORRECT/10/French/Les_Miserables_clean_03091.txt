He is the son of one of those brigands of the Loire , but children are innocent of their fathers ' crimes . 
I remember when he was no higher than that . 
He could not manage to pronounce his Ds . 
He had a way of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping . 
I remember that once , in front of the Hercules Farnese , people formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him , he was so handsome , was that child ! 
He had a head such as you see in pictures . 
I talked in a deep voice , and I frightened him with my cane , but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh . 
In the morning , when he entered my room , I grumbled , but he was like the sunlight to me , all the same . 
One can not defend oneself against those brats . 
They take hold of you , they hold you fast , they never let you go again .
