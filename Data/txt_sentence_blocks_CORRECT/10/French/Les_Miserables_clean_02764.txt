The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant 's shout ; the shot brought on a general random discharge , after which they reloaded their weapons and began again . 
This blind-man 's - buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several panes of glass . 
In the meanwhile , Gavroche , who had retraced his steps at full speed , halted five or six streets distant and seated himself , panting , on the stone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges . 
He listened . 
After panting for a few minutes , he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging , lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times , as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand ; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom has condensed French irony , and which is evidently efficacious , since it has already lasted half a century . 
This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection . 
`` Yes , '' said he , `` I 'm splitting with laughter , I 'm twisting with delight , I abound in joy , but I 'm losing my way , I shall have to take a roundabout way . 
If I only reach the barricade in season ! '' 
Thereupon he set out again on a run . 
And as he ran : -- `` Ah , by the way , where was I ? ''
