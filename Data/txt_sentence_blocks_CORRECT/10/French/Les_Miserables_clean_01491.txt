`` What name ? '' 
`` Marius Pontmercy . '' 
`` The wicked fellow ! '' 
exclaimed his aunt . 
`` Ah ! 
your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself . 
To think that he is to pass the night in a diligence ! '' 
`` Just as I am going to do . '' 
`` But you -- it is your duty ; in his case , it is wildness . '' 
`` Bosh ! ''
