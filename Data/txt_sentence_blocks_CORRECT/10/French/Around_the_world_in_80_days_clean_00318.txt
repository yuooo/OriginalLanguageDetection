As for Passepartout , he thought Mr. Fogg 's manoeuvre simply glorious . 
The captain had said `` between eleven and twelve knots , '' and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction . 
If , then -- for there were `` ifs '' still -- the sea did not become too boisterous , if the wind did not veer round to the east , if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery , the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days , between the 12th and the 21st of December . 
It is true that , once arrived , the affair on board the Henrietta , added to that of the Bank of England , might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire . 
During the first days , they went along smoothly enough . 
The sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north-east , the sails were hoisted , and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer . 
Passepartout was delighted . 
His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him . 
Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow . 
He formed warm friendships with the sailors , and amazed them with his acrobatic feats .
