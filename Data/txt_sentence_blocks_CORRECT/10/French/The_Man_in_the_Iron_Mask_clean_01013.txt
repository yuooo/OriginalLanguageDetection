: King Louis XIV . 
The king was seated in his cabinet , with his back turned towards the door of entrance . 
In front of him was a mirror , in which , while turning over his papers , he could see at a glance those who came in . 
He did not take any notice of the entrance of D'Artagnan , but spread above his letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate . 
D'Artagnan understood this by-play , and kept in the background ; so that at the end of a minute the king , who heard nothing , and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye , was obliged to cry , `` Is not M. d'Artagnan there ? '' 
`` I am here , sire , '' replied the musketeer , advancing . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said the king , fixing his pellucid eyes on D'Artagnan , `` what have you to say to me ? '' 
`` I , sire ! '' 
replied the latter , who watched the first blow of his adversary to make a good retort ; `` I have nothing to say to your majesty , unless it be that you have caused me to be arrested , and here I am . '' 
The king was going to reply that he had not had D'Artagnan arrested , but any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse , and he was silent .
