`` What nobleman ? '' 
asked the postmaster . 
`` M. le Comte de la Fere . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied the postmaster , uncovering with respect , `` a very worthy nobleman . 
But , whatever may be my desire to make myself agreeable to him , I can not furnish you with horses , for all mine are engaged by M. le Duc de Beaufort . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis , much disappointed . 
`` Only , '' continued the postmaster , `` if you will put up with a little carriage I have , I will harness an old blind horse who has still his legs left , and peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de la Fere . '' 
`` It is worth a louis , '' said Aramis .
