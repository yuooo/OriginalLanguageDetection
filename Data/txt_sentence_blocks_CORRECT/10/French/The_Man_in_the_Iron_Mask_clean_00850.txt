you open my eyes , '' replied the giant , stunned by the insinuation . 
And Porthos , whose eyes this reply of his friend 's had at last opened , or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight , went with his best speed to the batteries to overlook his people , and exhort every one to do his duty . 
In the meantime , Aramis , with his eye fixed on the horizon , saw the ships continually drawing nearer . 
The people and the soldiers , perched on the summits of the rocks , could distinguish the masts , then the lower sails , and at last the hulls of the lighters , bearing at the masthead the royal flag of France . 
It was night when one of these vessels , which had created such a sensation among the inhabitants of Belle-Isle , dropped anchor within cannon shot of the place . 
It was soon seen , notwithstanding the darkness , that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel , from the side of which a skiff was lowered , of which the three rowers , bending to their oars , took the direction of the port , and in a few instants struck land at the foot of the fort . 
The commander jumped ashore . 
He had a letter in his hand , which he waved in the air , and seemed to wish to communicate with somebody . 
This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of the pilots of the island . 
He was the captain of one of the two barks retained by Aramis , but which Porthos , in his anxiety with regard to the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared , had sent in search of the missing boats .
