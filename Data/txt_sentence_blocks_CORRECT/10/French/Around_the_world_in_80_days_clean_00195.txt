A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere , for making signals in the fogs . 
It was loaded to the muzzle ; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole , Mr. Fogg said , `` Hoist your flag ! '' 
The flag was run up at half-mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the American steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot-boat . 
`` Fire ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT , EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES , IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE 'S POCKET The Carnatic , setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th of November , directed her course at full steam towards Japan . 
She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers . 
Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied -- those which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg . 
The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye , staggering gait , and disordered hair , was seen to emerge from the second cabin , and to totter to a seat on deck .
