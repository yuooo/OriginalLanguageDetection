My father was as strong again as I am . 
He was a rough soldier , under Henry III . 
and Henry IV. ; his name was not Antoine , but Gaspard , the same as M. de Coligny . 
Always on horseback , he had never known what lassitude was . 
One evening , as he rose from table , his legs failed him . '' 
`` He had supped heartily , perhaps , '' said Aramis , `` and that was why he staggered . '' 
`` Bah ! 
A friend of M. de Bassompierre , nonsense ! 
No , no , he was astonished at this lassitude , and said to my mother , who laughed at him , ` Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar , as the late M. du Vallon , my father did ? ' '' 
`` Well ? ''
