In this conclave of young heads , there was one bald member . 
The Marquis d'Avaray , whom Louis XVIII . 
made a duke for having assisted him to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated , was wont to relate , that in 1814 , on his return to France , as the King was disembarking at Calais , a man handed him a petition . 
`` What is your request ? '' 
said the King . 
`` Sire , a post-office . '' 
`` What is your name ? '' 
`` L'Aigle . '' 
The King frowned , glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus : LESGLE . 
This non-Bonoparte orthography touched the King and he began to smile .
