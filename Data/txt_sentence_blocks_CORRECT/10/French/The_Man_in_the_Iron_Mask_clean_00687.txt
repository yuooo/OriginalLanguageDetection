`` At Nantes ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` In Bretagne . '' 
`` Yes , sire , it is in Bretagne . 
Will you majesty make so long a journey as to Nantes ? '' 
`` The States are assembled there , '' replied the king . 
`` I have two demands to make of them : I wish to be there . '' 
`` When shall I set out ? '' 
said the captain . 
`` This evening - to-morrow - to-morrow evening ; for you must stand in need of rest . ''
