`` I will call out so loudly , that the whole world shall hear me . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , take care ! '' 
Fouquet turned round towards the prelate , whom he looked at full in the face . 
`` You have dishonored me , '' he said , `` in committing so foul an act of treason , so heinous a crime upon my guest , upon one who was peacefully reposing beneath my roof .
