Let us stick to nature , then . 
We are at the top ; let us have a superior philosophy . 
What is the advantage of being at the top , if one sees no further than the end of other people 's noses ? 
Let us live merrily . 
Life is all . 
That man has another future elsewhere , on high , below , anywhere , I do n't believe ; not one single word of it . 
Ah ! 
sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me ; I must take heed to everything I do ; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil , over the just and the unjust , over the fas and the nefas . 
Why ? 
Because I shall have to render an account of my actions .
