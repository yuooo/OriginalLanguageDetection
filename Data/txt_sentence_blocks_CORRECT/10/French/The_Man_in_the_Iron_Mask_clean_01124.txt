`` Where are they buried ? '' 
said he . 
`` There , in the inclosure . 
There is a cross , you see , beneath yon little cypress . 
The tree of grief is planted over their tomb ; do n't go to it ; the king is going that way ; the heron has fallen just there . '' 
Aramis stopped , and concealed himself in the shade . 
They then saw , without being seen , the pale face of La Valliere , who , neglected in her carriage , at first looked on , with a melancholy heart , from the door , and then , carried away by jealousy , advanced into the chapel , whence , leaning against a pillar , she contemplated the king smiling and making signs to Madame de Montespan to approach , as there was nothing to be afraid of . 
Madame de Montespan complied ; she took the hand the king held out to her , and he , plucking out the first feather from the heron , which the falconer had strangled , placed it in his beautiful companion 's hat . 
She , smiling in her turn , kissed the hand tenderly which made her this present . 
The king grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure ; he looked at Madame de Montespan with all the fire of new love .
