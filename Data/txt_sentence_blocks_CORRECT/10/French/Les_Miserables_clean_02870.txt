One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue de la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot , the other balls . 
The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high , and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade , and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents , mingled with bursts of grape-shot . 
The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt , and to compel them to gather close in the interior , that is to say , this announced the assault . 
The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls , and from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot , the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off , perhaps , even , without being seen , could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt , as on the preceding evening , and , who knows ? 
take it by surprise . 
`` It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should be diminished , '' said Enjolras , and he shouted : `` Fire on the artillery-men ! '' 
All were ready . 
The barricade , which had long been silent , poured forth a desperate fire ; seven or eight discharges followed , with a sort of rage and joy ; the street was filled with blinding smoke , and , at the end of a few minutes , athwart this mist all streaked with flame , two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons . 
Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity , but the fire had slackened . 
`` Things are going well now , '' said Bossuet to Enjolras .
