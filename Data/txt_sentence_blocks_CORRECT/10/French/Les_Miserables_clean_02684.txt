shouted : -- `` Retire ! '' 
M. Mabeuf , pale , haggard , his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration , raised the flag above his head and repeated : -- `` Long live the Republic ! '' 
`` Fire ! '' 
said the voice . 
A second discharge , similar to the first , rained down upon the barricade . 
The old man fell on his knees , then rose again , dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement , like a log , at full length , with outstretched arms . 
Rivulets of blood flowed beneath him . 
His aged head , pale and sad , seemed to be gazing at the sky . 
One of those emotions which are superior to man , which make him forget even to defend himself , seized upon the insurgents , and they approached the body with respectful awe . 
`` What men these regicides were ! ''
