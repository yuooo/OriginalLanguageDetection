`` Here is the order . '' 
And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order . 
`` Do you know anything of the sea ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; I have traveled with M. le Prince . '' 
`` That is well . 
All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to form an escort and carry my provisions . 
The army must be prepared to embark in a fortnight at the very latest . '' 
`` That shall be done , monseigneur . '' 
`` The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles along the coast ; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may want for me . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur le duc . ''
