He had been shut up in the Custom House , and he was to be transferred to London the next day . 
Passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen . 
Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand . 
Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber . 
The young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly . 
As for Fix , he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty , whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not . 
The thought then struck Passepartout , that he was the cause of this new misfortune ! 
Had he not concealed Fix 's errand from his master ? 
When Fix revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told Mr. Fogg ? 
If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake ; at least , Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil .
