He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in the ante-chamber : the latter , a little pale , came hastily out of the dining - room to learn what was the matter . 
D'Artagnan smiled . 
`` There is nothing unpleasant , Monsieur Pelisson ; only a little order to receive the money for . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet 's friend , breathing more freely ; and he took the captain by the hand , and , dragging him behind him , led him into the dining-room , where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant , placed in the center , and buried in the cushions of a fauteuil . 
There were assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet . 
Joyous friends , for the most part faithful , they had not fled their protector at the approach of the storm , and , in spite of the threatening heavens , in spite of the trembling earth , they remained there , smiling , cheerful , as devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity . 
On the left of the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere ; on his right was Madame Fouquet ; as if braving the laws of the world , and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to silence , the two protecting angels of this man united to offer , at the moment of the crisis , the support of their twined arms . 
Madame de Belliere was pale , trembling , and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante , who , with one hand on her husband 's , was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson had gone out to bring D'Artagnan . 
The captain entered at first full of courtesy , and afterwards of admiration , when , with his infallible glance , he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face .
