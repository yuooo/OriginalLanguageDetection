By juxtaposition . 
This sceptic 's name was Grantaire , and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus : R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything . 
Moreover , he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris ; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Cafe Lemblin , and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire , that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage , on the Boulevard du Maine , spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget 's , excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette , and a certain thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat . 
He knew the best place for everything ; in addition , boxing and foot-fencing and some dances ; and he was a thorough single-stick player . 
He was a tremendous drinker to boot . 
He was inordinately homely : the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day , Irma Boissy , enraged with his homeliness , pronounced sentence on him as follows : `` Grantaire is impossible '' ; but Grantaire 's fatuity was not to be disconcerted . 
He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women , with the air of saying to them all : `` If I only chose ! '' 
and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand . 
All those words : rights of the people , rights of man , the social contract , the French Revolution , the Republic , democracy , humanity , civilization , religion , progress , came very near to signifying nothing whatever to Grantaire . 
He smiled at them .
