And you belong to that small class who are happy ! 
As for the rest of mankind , stagnating night rests upon them . 
Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase : the fortunate and the unfortunate . 
In this world , evidently the vestibule of another , there are no fortunate . 
The real human division is this : the luminous and the shady . 
To diminish the number of the shady , to augment the number of the luminous , -- that is the object . 
That is why we cry : Education ! 
science ! 
To teach reading , means to light the fire ; every syllable spelled out sparkles . 
However , he who says light does not , necessarily , say joy .
