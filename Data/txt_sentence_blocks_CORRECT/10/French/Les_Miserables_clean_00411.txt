Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness . 
It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes , we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation ; and we could easily recognize this truth , hardly perceived by the thinker , that from the oyster to the eagle , from the pig to the tiger , all animals exist in man , and that each one of them is in a man . 
Sometimes even several of them at a time . 
Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices , straying before our eyes , the visible phantoms of our souls . 
God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect . 
Only since animals are mere shadows , God has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word ; what is the use ? 
On the contrary , our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them , God has bestowed on them intelligence ; that is to say , the possibility of education . 
Social education , when well done , can always draw from a soul , of whatever sort it may be , the utility which it contains . 
This , be it said , is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent , and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man . 
The visible I in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent I. Having made this reservation , let us pass on .
