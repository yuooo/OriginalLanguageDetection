It was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers . 
`` Good , '' he said to himself , `` those unhappy girls dropped it . '' 
He retraced his steps , he called , he did not find them ; he reflected that they must already be far away , put the package in his pocket , and went off to dine . 
On the way , he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard , a child 's coffin , covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs , and illuminated by a candle . 
The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind . 
`` Poor mothers ! '' 
he thought . 
`` There is one thing sadder than to see one 's children die ; it is to see them leading an evil life . '' 
Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts , and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations . 
He fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight , beneath the beautiful trees of Luxembourg .
