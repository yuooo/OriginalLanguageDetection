About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place . 
This detail is important , and we regard it as useful to develop it at length ; we should almost say , to underline it . 
From time immemorial , M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany . 
This industry had always vegetated , on account of the high price of the raw material , which reacted on the manufacture . 
At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M. , an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of `` black goods . '' 
Towards the close of 1815 a man , a stranger , had established himself in the town , and had been inspired with the idea of substituting , in this manufacture , gum-lac for resin , and , for bracelets in particular , slides of sheet-iron simply laid together , for slides of soldered sheet-iron . 
This very small change had effected a revolution . 
This very small change had , in fact , prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material , which had rendered it possible in the first place , to raise the price of manufacture , a benefit to the country ; in the second place , to improve the workmanship , an advantage to the consumer ; in the third place , to sell at a lower price , while trebling the profit , which was a benefit to the manufacturer . 
Thus three results ensued from one idea . 
In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich , which is good , and had made every one about him rich , which is better .
