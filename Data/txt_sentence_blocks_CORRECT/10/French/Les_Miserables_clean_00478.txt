To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly ! 
Then I could no longer earn enough , and all this misery followed . 
In the first place , there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make , and that is , to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people . 
I will explain it to you , you see : you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making , the price falls to nine sous ; and it is not enough to live on . 
Then one has to become whatever one can . 
As for me , I had my little Cosette , and I was actually forced to become a bad woman . 
Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief . 
After that I stamped on that gentleman 's hat in front of the officers ' cafe ; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow . 
We women have but one silk dress for evening wear . 
You see that I did not do wrong deliberately -- truly , Monsieur Javert ; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I , and who are much happier .
