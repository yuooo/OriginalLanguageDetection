It was a little boy who had been born to the Thenardiers during one of the preceding winters , -- `` she did not know why , '' she said , `` the result of the cold , '' -- and who was a little more than three years old . 
The mother had nursed him , but she did not love him . 
When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying , `` Your son is squalling , '' Thenardier would say ; `` do go and see what he wants . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
the mother would reply , `` he bothers me . '' 
And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark . 
TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS So far in this book the Thenardiers have been viewed only in profile ; the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple , and considering it under all its aspects . 
Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday ; Madame Thenardier was approaching her forties , which is equivalent to fifty in a woman ; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife . 
Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thenardier woman , ever since her first appearance , -- tall , blond , red , fat , angular , square , enormous , and agile ; she belonged , as we have said , to the race of those colossal wild women , who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair . 
She did everything about the house , -- made the beds , did the washing , the cooking , and everything else .
