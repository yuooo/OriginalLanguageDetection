From the noble simplicity of her costume , she must be a woman of distinction . 
Outside the inclosure were several horses mounted by servants ; a travelling carriage was in waiting for this lady . 
D'Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her delay . 
She continued praying , and frequently pressed her handkerchief to her face , by which D'Artagnan perceived she was weeping . 
He beheld her strike her breast with the compunction of a Christian woman . 
He heard her several times exclaim as from a wounded heart : `` Pardon ! 
pardon ! '' 
And as she appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief , as she threw herself down , almost fainting , exhausted by complaints and prayers , D'Artagnan , touched by this love for his so much regretted friends , made a few steps towards the grave , in order to interrupt the melancholy colloquy of the penitent with the dead . 
But as soon as his step sounded on the gravel , the unknown raised her head , revealing to D'Artagnan a face aflood with tears , a well-known face . 
It was Mademoiselle de la Valliere !
