When he talks , he says that a bishop ought to be so . 
Just imagine ! 
the door of our house is never fastened . 
Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother 's room . 
He fears nothing , even at night . 
That is his sort of bravery , he says . 
He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him . 
He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers , and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it . 
One must know how to understand him . 
He goes out in the rain , he walks in the water , he travels in winter .
