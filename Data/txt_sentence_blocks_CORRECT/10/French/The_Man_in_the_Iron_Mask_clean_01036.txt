Your grief , my friend , was so well worthy of respect . 
It was my duty to treat it gently . 
To have informed you of this misfortune , which I knew would pain you so greatly , D'Artagnan , would have been , in your eyes , to have triumphed over you . 
Yes , I knew that M. du Vallon had buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria ; I knew that M. d'Herblay had taken one of my vessels with its crew , and had compelled it to convey him to Bayonne . 
But I was willing you should learn these matters in a direct manner , in order that you might be convinced my friends are with me respected and sacred ; that always in me the man will sacrifice himself to subjects , whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men to majesty and power . '' 
`` But , sire , how could you know ? '' 
`` How do you yourself know , D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` By this letter , sire , which M. d'Herblay , free and out of danger , writes me from Bayonne . '' 
`` Look here , '' said the king , drawing from a casket placed upon the table closet to the seat upon which D'Artagnan was leaning , `` here is a letter copied exactly from that of M. d'Herblay . 
Here is the very letter , which Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours .
