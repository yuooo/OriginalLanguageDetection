It was that first , redoubtable moment of inundation , when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike . 
A second more and the barricade would have been taken . 
Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering , and killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun ; the second killed Bahorel with a blow from his bayonet . 
Another had already overthrown Courfeyrac , who was shouting : `` Follow me ! '' 
The largest of all , a sort of colossus , marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed . 
The urchin took in his arms Javert 's immense gun , levelled it resolutely at the giant , and fired . 
No discharge followed . 
Javert 's gun was not loaded . 
The municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child . 
Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche , the gun slipped from the soldier 's grasp , a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead , and he fell over on his back .
