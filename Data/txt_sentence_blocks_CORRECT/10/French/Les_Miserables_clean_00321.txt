This note jotted down on the margin of Angles ' report , we will return to our four couples . 
The dinner , as we have said , was drawing to its close . 
A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER Chat at table , the chat of love ; it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other ; the chat of love is a cloud ; the chat at table is smoke . 
Fameuil and Dahlia were humming . 
Tholomyes was drinking . 
Zephine was laughing , Fantine smiling , Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud . 
Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said : -- `` Blachevelle , I adore you . '' 
This called forth a question from Blachevelle : -- `` What would you do , Favourite , if I were to cease to love you ? '' 
`` I ! '' 
cried Favourite .
