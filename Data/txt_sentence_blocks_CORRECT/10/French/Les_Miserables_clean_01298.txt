If any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery , there was but one way for him to get out -- his grave-digger 's card furnished by the department of public funerals . 
A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter 's window . 
The grave-digger dropped his card into this box , the porter heard it fall , pulled the rope , and the small door opened . 
If the man had not his card , he mentioned his name , the porter , who was sometimes in bed and asleep , rose , came out and identified the man , and opened the gate with his key ; the grave-digger stepped out , but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs .

This cemetery , with its peculiarities outside the regulations , embarrassed the symmetry of the administration . 
It was suppressed a little later than 1830 . 
The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse , called the Eastern cemetery , succeeded to it , and inherited that famous dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery , which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board , and which formed an angle , one side on the drinkers ' tables , and the other on the tombs , with this sign : Au Bon Coing . 
The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery . 
It was falling into disuse .
