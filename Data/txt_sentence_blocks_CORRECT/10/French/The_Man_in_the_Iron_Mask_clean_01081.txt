`` Athos ! 
Athos ! 
my friend ! '' 
cried this voice , agitated even to tears . 
`` Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan , '' faltered out Grimaud . 
`` Where is he ? 
Where is he ? '' 
continued the musketeer . 
Grimaud seized his arm in his bony fingers , and pointed to the bed , upon the sheets of which the livid tints of death already showed . 
A choked respiration , the opposite to a sharp cry , swelled the throat of D'Artagnan .
