What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality ? 
What door did he decide to open ? 
Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning ? 
Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him , which was his choice ? 
What extremity did he accept ? 
To which of the gulfs did he nod his head ? 
His dizzy revery lasted all night long . 
He remained there until daylight , in the same attitude , bent double over that bed , prostrate beneath the enormity of fate , crushed , perchance , alas ! 
with clenched fists , with arms outspread at right angles , like a man crucified who has been un-nailed , and flung face down on the earth . 
There he remained for twelve hours , the twelve long hours of a long winter 's night , ice-cold , without once raising his head , and without uttering a word .
