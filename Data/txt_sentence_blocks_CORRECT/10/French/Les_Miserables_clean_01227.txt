said Jean Valjean . 
The interrogation mark which accentuated this `` well '' signified : `` it seems to me that one may remain concealed here ? '' 
It was to this interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded : -- `` There are the little girls . '' 
`` What little girls ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered , a bell emitted one stroke . 
`` The nun is dead , '' said he . 
`` There is the knell . '' 
And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen . 
The bell struck a second time .
