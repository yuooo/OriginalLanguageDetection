at last raised his eyes , and finding Colbert attentively waiting for his next remarks , said , hastily , changing the conversation , `` M. Colbert , I perceive it is getting very late , and I shall now retire to bed . 
By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind . '' 
`` Very good , sire , '' returned Colbert , greatly incensed , although he restrained himself in the presence of the king . 
The king made a gesture of adieu , and Colbert withdrew with a respectful bow . 
`` My attendants ! '' 
cried the king ; and , as they entered the apartment , Philippe was about to quit his post of observation . 
`` A moment longer , '' said Aramis to him , with his accustomed gentleness of manner ; `` what has just now taken place is only a detail , and to-morrow we shall have no occasion to think anything more about it ; but the ceremony of the king 's retiring to rest , the etiquette observed in addressing the king , that indeed is of the greatest importance . 
Learn , sire , and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night . 
Look ! 
look ! ''
