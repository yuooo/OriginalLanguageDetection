I saw you , Thenardier Jondrette , in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital . 
I know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose . 
Here are a thousand francs , bully that you are ! '' 
And he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier . 
`` Ah ! 
Jondrette Thenardier , vile rascal ! 
Let this serve you as a lesson , you dealer in second-hand secrets , merchant of mysteries , rummager of the shadows , wretch ! 
Take these five hundred francs and get out of here ! 
Waterloo protects you . '' 
`` Waterloo ! ''
