Sleep comes more easily than it returns . 
This is what happened to Jean Valjean . 
He could not get to sleep again , and he fell to thinking . 
He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one 's mind are troubled . 
There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain . 
His memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly , losing their proper forms , becoming disproportionately large , then suddenly disappearing , as in a muddy and perturbed pool . 
Many thoughts occurred to him ; but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh , and which drove away all others . 
We will mention this thought at once : he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed on the table . 
Those six sets of silver haunted him . 
-- They were there .
