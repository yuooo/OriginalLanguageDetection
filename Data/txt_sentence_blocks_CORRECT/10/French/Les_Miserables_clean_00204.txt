It was Mother Gerbaud , with her little one in her arms . 
My brother kissed the child on the brow , and borrowed fifteen sous which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud . 
The man was not paying much heed to anything then . 
He was no longer talking , and he seemed very much fatigued . 
After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure , my brother said grace ; then he turned to the man and said to him , ` You must be in great need of your bed . ' 
Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly . 
I understood that we must retire , in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep , and we both went up stairs . 
Nevertheless , I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later , to carry to the man 's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest , which was in my room . 
The nights are frigid , and that keeps one warm . 
It is a pity that this skin is old ; all the hair is falling out .
