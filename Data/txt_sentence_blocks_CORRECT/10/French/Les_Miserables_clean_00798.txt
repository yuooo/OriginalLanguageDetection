All at once , the cuirassiers , who had been the assailants , found themselves assailed . 
The English cavalry was at their back . 
Before them two squares , behind them Somerset ; Somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard . 
On the right , Somerset had Dornberg with the German light-horse , and on his left , Trip with the Belgian carabineers ; the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front , before and in the rear , by infantry and cavalry , had to face all sides . 
What mattered it to them ? 
They were a whirlwind . 
Their valor was something indescribable . 
In addition to this , they had behind them the battery , which was still thundering . 
It was necessary that it should be so , or they could never have been wounded in the back . 
One of their cuirasses , pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a biscayan , -LSB- 9 -RSB- is in the collection of the Waterloo Museum .
