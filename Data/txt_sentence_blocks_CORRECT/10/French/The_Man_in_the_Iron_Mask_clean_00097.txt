exclaimed Percerin , crossly . 
`` M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
Percerin attempted a bow , which found no favor in the eyes of the terrible Porthos , who , from his first entry into the room , had been regarding the tailor askance . 
`` A very good friend of mine , '' concluded D'Artagnan . 
`` I will attend to monsieur , '' said Percerin , `` but later . '' 
`` Later ? 
but when ? '' 
`` When I have time . '' 
`` You have already told my valet as much , '' broke in Porthos , discontentedly .
