`` In my lodge . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
ejaculated Courfeyrac . 
`` But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour , '' said the portress . 
At the same time , a sort of pale , thin , small , freckled , and youthful artisan , clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet , and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man , emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman 's voice : -- `` Monsieur Marius , if you please . '' 
`` He is not here . '' 
`` Will he return this evening ? '' 
`` I know nothing about it . '' 
And Courfeyrac added : -- `` For my part , I shall not return . '' 
The young man gazed steadily at him and said : -- `` Why not ? ''
