`` A secret . '' 
`` A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty 's interests ? '' 
`` You are , indeed , a man of superior intelligence , monseigneur , and have made a particularly accurate guess . 
I have , in fact , discovered a secret , of a nature to change the interests of the king of France . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet , with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask any more questions . 
`` And you shall judge of it yourself , '' pursued Aramis ; `` and you shall tell me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret . '' 
`` I am listening , since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me ; only do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be indiscreet in you to communicate . '' 
Aramis seemed , for a moment , as if he were collecting himself . 
`` Do not speak ! ''
