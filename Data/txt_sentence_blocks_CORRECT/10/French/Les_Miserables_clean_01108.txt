`` Ah , good God ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
Jean Valjean drew near to the old man , and said to him in a grave voice : -- `` Father Fauchelevent , I saved your life . '' 
`` I was the first to recall it , '' returned Fauchelevent . 
`` Well , you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden days . '' 
Fauchelevent took in his aged , trembling , and wrinkled hands Jean Valjean 's two robust hands , and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking . 
At length he exclaimed : -- `` Oh ! 
that would be a blessing from the good God , if I could make you some little return for that ! 
Save your life ! 
Monsieur le Maire , dispose of the old man ! ''
