During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg , Passepartout had been carefully observing him . 
He appeared to be a man about forty years of age , with fine , handsome features , and a tall , well-shaped figure ; his hair and whiskers were light , his forehead compact and unwrinkled , his face rather pale , his teeth magnificent . 
His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call `` repose in action , '' a quality of those who act rather than talk . 
Calm and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas . 
Seen in the various phases of his daily life , he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced , as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer . 
Phileas Fogg was , indeed , exactitude personified , and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet ; for in men , as well as in animals , the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions . 
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions . 
He never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated . 
He was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment . 
He lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .
