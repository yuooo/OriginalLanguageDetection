At the moment when Porthos , more accustomed to the darkness than these men , coming from open daylight , was looking round him to see if through this artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal , he felt his arm gently touched , and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear , `` Come . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis , if possible , yet more softly . 
And amidst the noise of the third brigade , which continued to advance , the imprecations of the guards still left alive , the muffled groans of the dying , Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the cavern . 
Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment , and showed him , in a hollow of the rocky wall , a barrel of powder weighing from seventy to eighty pounds , to which he had just attached a fuse . 
`` My friend , '' said he to Porthos , `` you will take this barrel , the match of which I am going to set fire to , and throw it amidst our enemies ; can you do so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
replied Porthos ; and he lifted the barrel with one hand .
