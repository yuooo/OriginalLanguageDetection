Of the prodigy of all wraths , said others . 
It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred , ruin . 
It might be asked : Who built this ? 
It might also be said : Who destroyed this ? 
It was the improvisation of the ebullition . 
Hold ! 
take this door ! 
this grating ! 
this penthouse ! 
this chimney-piece !
