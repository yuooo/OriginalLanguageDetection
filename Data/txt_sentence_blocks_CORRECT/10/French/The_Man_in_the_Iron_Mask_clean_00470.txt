: The King 's Gratitude . 
The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they suddenly and abruptly stopped , as a mutual recognition took place , and each uttered a cry of horror . 
`` Have you come to assassinate me , monsieur ? ''

`` The king in this state ! '' 
murmured the minister . 
Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him ; his clothes were in tatters ; his shirt , open and torn to rags , was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms . 
Haggard , ghastly pale , his hair in disheveled masses , Louis XIV . 
presented the most perfect picture of despair , distress , anger and fear combined that could possibly be united in one figure . 
Fouquet was so touched , so affected and disturbed by it , that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears .
