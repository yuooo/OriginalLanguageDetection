For our part , we reserve to the word its ancient and precise , circumscribed and determined significance , and we restrict slang to slang . 
The veritable slang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang , if the two words can be coupled thus , the slang immemorial which was a kingdom , is nothing else , we repeat , than the homely , uneasy , crafty , treacherous , venomous , cruel , equivocal , vile , profound , fatal tongue of wretchedness . 
There exists , at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes , a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights ; a fearful conflict , where , now cunning , now violent , unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time , it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice , and with club-blows through crime . 
To meet the needs of this conflict , wretchedness has invented a language of combat , which is slang . 
To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion , to hold above the gulf , were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would , otherwise , be lost , that is to say , one of the elements , good or bad , of which civilization is composed , or by which it is complicated , to extend the records of social observation ; is to serve civilization itself . 
This service Plautus rendered , consciously or unconsciously , by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician ; that service Moliere rendered , by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects . 
Here objections spring up afresh . 
Phoenician , very good ! 
Levantine , quite right ! 
Even dialect , let that pass !
