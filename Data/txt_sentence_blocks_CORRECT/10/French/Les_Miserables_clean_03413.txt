A letter , like a man , may have an unprepossessing exterior . 
Coarse paper , coarsely folded -- the very sight of certain missives is displeasing . 
The letter which Basque had brought was of this sort . 
Marius took it . 
It smelled of tobacco . 
Nothing evokes a memory like an odor . 
Marius recognized that tobacco . 
He looked at the superscription : `` To Monsieur , Monsieur le Baron Pommerci . 
At his hotel . '' 
The recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well .
