`` Come , that is true ; I even have a good appetite . '' 
He followed the woman , who had a rosy , cheerful face ; she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth . 
`` Make haste ! '' 
said he ; `` I must start again ; I am in a hurry . '' 
A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste ; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort . 
`` That is what ailed me , '' he thought ; `` I had not breakfasted . '' 
His breakfast was served ; he seized the bread , took a mouthful , and then slowly replaced it on the table , and did not touch it again . 
A carter was eating at another table ; he said to this man : -- `` Why is their bread so bitter here ? '' 
The carter was a German and did not understand him . 
He returned to the stable and remained near the horse .
