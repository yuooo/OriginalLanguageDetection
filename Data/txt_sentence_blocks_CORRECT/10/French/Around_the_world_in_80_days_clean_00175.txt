`` Not with you , Mr. Fogg , '' was her answer . 
The pilot now returned , shuffling his hat in his hands . 
`` Well , pilot ? '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Well , your honour , '' replied he , `` I could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year . 
Besides , we could not reach Yokohama in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong . '' 
`` Only sixteen hundred , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the same thing . '' 
Fix breathed more freely . 
`` But , '' added the pilot , `` it might be arranged another way . ''
