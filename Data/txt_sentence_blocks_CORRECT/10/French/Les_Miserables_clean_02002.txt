The government was there purely and simply called in question . 
There people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet . 
There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm , and `` that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy . '' 
This engagement once entered into , a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop `` assumed a sonorous tone , '' and said , `` You understand ! 
You have sworn ! '' 
Sometimes they went up stairs , to a private room on the first floor , and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted . 
They made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families . 
That was the formula . 
In the tap-rooms , `` subversive '' pamphlets were read . 
They treated the government with contempt , says a secret report of that time .
