Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time ! 
In addition to his other qualities , Thenardier was attentive and penetrating , silent or talkative , according to circumstances , and always highly intelligent . 
He had something of the look of sailors , who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses . 
Thenardier was a statesman . 
Every new-comer who entered the tavern said , on catching sight of Madame Thenardier , `` There is the master of the house . '' 
A mistake . 
She was not even the mistress . 
The husband was both master and mistress . 
She worked ; he created . 
He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action .
