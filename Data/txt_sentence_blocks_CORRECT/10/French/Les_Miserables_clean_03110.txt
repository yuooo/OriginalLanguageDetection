He put questions to himself , and made replies to himself , and his replies frightened him . 
He asked himself : `` What has that convict done , that desperate fellow , whom I have pursued even to persecution , and who has had me under his foot , and who could have avenged himself , and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety , in leaving me my life , in showing mercy upon me ? 
His duty ? 
No . 
Something more . 
And I in showing mercy upon him in my turn -- what have I done ? 
My duty ? 
No . 
Something more . 
So there is something beyond duty ? ''
