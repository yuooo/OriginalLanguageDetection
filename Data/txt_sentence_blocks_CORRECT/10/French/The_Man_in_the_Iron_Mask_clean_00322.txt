Then it seemed to him as if the dome gradually retired , escaping from his gaze , and that the figures and attributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance became more and more remote . 
A gentle , easy movement , as regular as that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves , had succeeded to the immovableness of the bed . 
Doubtless the king was dreaming , and in this dream the crown of gold , which fastened the curtains together , seemed to recede from his vision , just as the dome , to which it remained suspended , had done , so that the winged genius which , with both its hand , supported the crown , seemed , though vainly so , to call upon the king , who was fast disappearing from it . 
The bed still sunk . 
Louis , with his eyes open , could not resist the deception of this cruel hallucination . 
At last , as the light of the royal chamber faded away into darkness and gloom , something cold , gloomy , and inexplicable in its nature seemed to infect the air . 
No paintings , nor gold , nor velvet hangings , were visible any longer , nothing but walls of a dull gray color , which the increasing gloom made darker every moment . 
And yet the bed still continued to descend , and after a minute , which seemed in its duration almost an age to the king , it reached a stratum of air , black and chill as death , and then it stopped . 
The king could no longer see the light in his room , except as from the bottom of a well we can see the light of day . 
`` I am under the influence of some atrocious dream , '' he thought .
