He rose unsteadily , and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic of the floor ; but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief ; she felt that in the flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself . 
A woman , ever vigilant , she did not think she ought to let the opportunity slip of making good her justification ; but Raoul , though stopped by her in the middle of the gallery , did not seem disposed to surrender without a combat . 
He took it up in a tone so cold and embarrassed , that if they had been thus surprised , the whole court would have no doubt about the proceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur , '' said she with disdain , `` what you are doing is very unworthy of a gentleman . 
My heart inclines me to speak to you ; you compromise me by a reception almost uncivil ; you are wrong , monsieur ; and you confound your friends with enemies . 
Farewell ! '' 
Raoul had sworn never to speak of Louise , never even to look at those who might have seen Louise ; he was going into another world , that he might never meet with anything Louise had seen , or even touched . 
But after the first shock of his pride , after having had a glimpse of Montalais , the companion of Louise - Montalais , who reminded him of the turret of Blois and the joys of youth - all his reason faded away . 
`` Pardon me , mademoiselle ; it enters not , it can not enter into my thoughts to be uncivil . ''
