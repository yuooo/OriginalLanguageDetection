These two creatures were resplendent . 
They had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment , at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy . 
They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire ; they were forty years old taken together . 
It was marriage sublimated ; these two children were two lilies . 
They did not see each other , they did not contemplate each other . 
Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory ; Marius perceived Cosette on an altar . 
And on that altar , and in that glory , the two apotheoses mingling , in the background , one knows not how , behind a cloud for Cosette , in a flash for Marius , there was the ideal thing , the real thing , the meeting of the kiss and the dream , the nuptial pillow . 
All the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication . 
It seemed to them that their sorrows , their sleepless nights , their tears , their anguish , their terrors , their despair , converted into caresses and rays of light , rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching ; and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy . 
How good it is to have suffered !
