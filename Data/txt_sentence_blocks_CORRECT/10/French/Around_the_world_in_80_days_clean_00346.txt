`` When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal ; then your existence would have been free and happy . 
But now I am ruined . '' 
`` I know it , Mr. Fogg , '' replied Aouda ; `` and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows ? 
-- for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? '' 
`` Madam , you could not remain in India , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . '' 
`` So , Mr. Fogg , '' resumed Aouda , `` not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me . 
Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service . '' 
`` But what will become of you , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` As for me , madam , '' replied the gentleman , coldly , `` I have need of nothing . ''
