When you shall have paid all M. Fouquet 's debts , and restored the finances to a sound condition , M. Fouquet will be able to remain the sovereign ruler in his little court of poets and painters , - we shall have made him rich . 
When that has been done , and I have become your royal highness 's prime minister , I shall be able to think of my own interests and yours . '' 
The young man looked at his interrogator . 
`` M. de Richelieu , of whom we were speaking just now , was very much to blame in the fixed idea he had of governing France alone , unaided . 
He allowed two kings , King Louis XIII . 
and himself , to be seated on the self - same throne , whilst he might have installed them more conveniently upon two separate and distinct thrones . '' 
`` Upon two thrones ? '' 
said the young man , thoughtfully . 
`` In fact , '' pursued Aramis , quietly , `` a cardinal , prime minister of France , assisted by the favor and by the countenance of his Most Christian Majesty the King of France , a cardinal to whom the king his master lends the treasures of the state , his army , his counsel , such a man would be acting with twofold injustice in applying these mighty resources to France alone . 
Besides , '' added Aramis , `` you will not be a king such as your father was , delicate in health , slow in judgment , whom all things wearied ; you will be a king governing by your brain and by your sword ; you will have in the government of the state no more than you will be able to manage unaided ; I should only interfere with you .
