`` At once , madam . '' 
`` But the prisoners , our unfortunate fellow-travellers -- '' `` I can not interrupt the trip , '' replied the conductor . 
`` We are already three hours behind time . '' 
`` And when will another train pass here from San Francisco ? '' 
`` To-morrow evening , madam . '' 
`` To-morrow evening ! 
But then it will be too late ! 
We must wait -- '' `` It is impossible , '' responded the conductor . 
`` If you wish to go , please get in . '' 
`` I will not go , '' said Aouda .
