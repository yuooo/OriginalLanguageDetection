`` So he is the father . '' 
`` What concern is that of mine ? '' 
`` I tell you that he 's the father . '' 
`` As if he were the only father . '' 
`` Listen . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I ca n't go out otherwise than masked . 
Here I 'm concealed , no one knows that I 'm here . 
But to-morrow , there will be no more maskers . 
It 's Ash Wednesday .
