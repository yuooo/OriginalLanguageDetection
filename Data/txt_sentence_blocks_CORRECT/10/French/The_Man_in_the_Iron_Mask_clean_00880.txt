`` Let us see , '' said the musketeer , placing his ear near Aramis 's mouth . 
The latter spoke several words rapidly , to which D'Artagnan replied , `` That is it , precisely . '' 
`` Infallible ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` During the first emotion this resolution will cause , take care of yourself , Aramis . '' 
`` Oh ! 
do n't be afraid . '' 
`` Now , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan to the officer , `` thanks , a thousand thanks ! 
You have made yourself three friends for life . ''
