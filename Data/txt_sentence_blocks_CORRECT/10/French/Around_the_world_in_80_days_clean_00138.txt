The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers . 
The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m. , to receive coal , having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival . 
Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal , and then , accompanied by Aouda , who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore , disembarked . 
Fix , who suspected Mr. Fogg 's every movement , followed them cautiously , without being himself perceived ; while Passepartout , laughing in his sleeve at Fix 's manoeuvres , went about his usual errands . 
The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect , for there are no mountains ; yet its appearance is not without attractions . 
It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues . 
A handsome carriage , drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses , carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage , and of clove-trees , whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower . 
Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields ; sago-bushes , large ferns with gorgeous branches , varied the aspect of this tropical clime ; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume . 
Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees , nor were tigers wanting in the jungles . 
After a drive of two hours through the country , Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town , which is a vast collection of heavy-looking , irregular houses , surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants ; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked , closely followed by the detective , who had kept them constantly in sight .
