well ! 
so you are a baron now . 
I present you my compliments . 
What is the meaning of this ? '' 
Marius reddened slightly and replied : -- `` It means that I am the son of my father . '' 
M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh , and said harshly : -- `` I am your father . '' 
`` My father , '' retorted Marius , with downcast eyes and a severe air , `` was a humble and heroic man , who served the Republic and France gloriously , who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made , who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century , beneath grape-shot and bullets , in snow and mud by day , beneath rain at night , who captured two flags , who received twenty wounds , who died forgotten and abandoned , and who never committed but one mistake , which was to love too fondly two ingrates , his country and myself . '' 
This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear . 
At the word republic , he rose , or , to speak more correctly , he sprang to his feet . 
Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand .
