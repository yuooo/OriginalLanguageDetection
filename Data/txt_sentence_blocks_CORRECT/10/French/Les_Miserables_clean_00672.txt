This what I wanted to say ; I could not find words for it at first . 
I have stolen nothing . 
I am a man who does not have something to eat every day . 
I was coming from Ailly ; I was walking through the country after a shower , which had made the whole country yellow : even the ponds were overflowed , and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside . 
I found a broken branch with apples on the ground ; I picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble . 
I have been in prison , and they have been dragging me about for the last three months ; more than that I can not say ; people talk against me , they tell me , ` Answer ! ' 
The gendarme , who is a good fellow , nudges my elbow , and says to me in a low voice , ` Come , answer ! ' 
I do n't know how to explain ; I have no education ; I am a poor man ; that is where they wrong me , because they do not see this . 
I have not stolen ; I picked up from the ground things that were lying there . 
You say , Jean Valjean , Jean Mathieu !
