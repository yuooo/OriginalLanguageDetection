`` Perhaps he 's a manufacturer , then . '' 
`` The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman . '' 
It was Phileas Fogg , whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers , who made this remark . 
He bowed to his friends , and entered into the conversation . 
The affair which formed its subject , and which was town talk , had occurred three days before at the Bank of England . 
A package of banknotes , to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds , had been taken from the principal cashier 's table , that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence . 
Of course , he could not have his eyes everywhere . 
Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public . 
There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures ; gold , silver , banknotes are freely exposed , at the mercy of the first comer . 
A keen observer of English customs relates that , being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day , he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds .
