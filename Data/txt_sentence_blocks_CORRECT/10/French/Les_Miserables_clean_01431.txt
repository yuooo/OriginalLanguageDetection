`` Sus is superfluous , '' observed M. Gillenormand . 
-LSB- 22 -RSB- Remarks of this nature found a situation . 
-LSB- 22 -RSB- Suspendu , suspended ; pendu , hung . 
At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons , he said , on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by : `` There goes his Excellency the Evil One . '' 
M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter , that tall mademoiselle , who was over forty and looked fifty , and by a handsome little boy of seven years , white , rosy , fresh , with happy and trusting eyes , who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him : `` How handsome he is ! 
What a pity ! 
Poor child ! '' 
This child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago . 
He was called `` poor child , '' because he had for a father `` a brigand of the Loire . '' 
This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand 's son-in-law , who has already been mentioned , and whom M. Gillenormand called `` the disgrace of his family . ''
