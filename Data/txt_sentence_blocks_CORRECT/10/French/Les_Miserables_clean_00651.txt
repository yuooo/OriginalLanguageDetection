It was thus that he had , when occasion offered , supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne , the flax-spinning industry at Frevent , and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche . 
Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration . 
Arras and Douai envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor .

When the usher , discreetly opening the door which connected the council-chamber with the court-room , bent over the back of the President 's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused , adding : `` The gentleman desires to be present at the trial , '' the President , with a quick and deferential movement , seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher , saying , `` Admit him . '' 
The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall , in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him .

It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously , and who was now bowing to the earth before him . 
At the same time , the usher handed him the paper . 
He unfolded it , and as he chanced to be near the light , he could read it .
