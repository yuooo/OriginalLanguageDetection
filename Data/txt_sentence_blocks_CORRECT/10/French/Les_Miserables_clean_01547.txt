`` You are M. Marius Pontmercy ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` I was looking for you , '' resumed Laigle de Meaux . 
`` How so ? '' 
demanded Marius ; for it was he : in fact , he had just quitted his grandfather 's , and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time . 
`` I do not know you . '' 
`` Neither do I know you , '' responded Laigle . 
Marius thought he had encountered a wag , the beginning of a mystification in the open street . 
He was not in a very good humor at the moment . 
He frowned .
