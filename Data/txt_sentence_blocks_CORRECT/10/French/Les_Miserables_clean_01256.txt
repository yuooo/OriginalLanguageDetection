The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet . 
Fauchelevent held his peace . 
She went on : -- `` I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord , who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life , and who bear wonderful fruit . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden . '' 
`` Besides , she is more than a dead woman , she is a saint . '' 
`` Like yourself , reverend Mother . '' 
`` She slept in her coffin for twenty years , by express permission of our Holy Father , Pius VII . 
-- '' `` The one who crowned the Emp -- Buonaparte . '' 
For a clever man like Fauchelevent , this allusion was an awkward one .
