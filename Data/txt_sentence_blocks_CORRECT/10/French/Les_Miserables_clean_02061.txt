The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of Patron Minette in close confinement , in the hope that he would chatter . 
This man was Brujon , the long-haired man of the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard , and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him . 
This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force . 
In that hideous courtyard , called the court of the Batiment-Neuf -LRB- New Building -RRB- , which the administration called the court Saint-Bernard , and which the robbers called the Fosseaux-Lions -LRB- The Lion 's Ditch -RRB- , on that wall covered with scales and leprosy , which rose on the left to a level with the roofs , near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of La Force , then turned in a dormitory for ruffians , there could still be seen , twelve years ago , a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail , and beneath it this signature : -- BRUJON , 1811 . 
The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832 . 
The latter , of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau house , was a very cunning and very adroit young spark , with a bewildered and plaintive air . 
It was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him , thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne yard than in close confinement . 
Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice . 
They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that .
