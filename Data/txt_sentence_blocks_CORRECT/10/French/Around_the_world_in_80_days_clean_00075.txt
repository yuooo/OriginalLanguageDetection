His old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . 
He came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . 
Already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . 
He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . 
Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer . 
The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway . 
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains , which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund , towards evening . 
The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . 
This famous timepiece , always regulated on the Greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . 
Sir Francis corrected Passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at London time .
