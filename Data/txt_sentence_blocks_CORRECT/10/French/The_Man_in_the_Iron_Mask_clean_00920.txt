At length , after a rapid race , frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages , they reached the deep grottoes , in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season . 
`` My good friend , '' said Porthos , panting vigorously , `` we have arrived , it seems . 
But I thought you spoke of three men , three servants , who were to accompany us . 
I do n't see them - where are they ? '' 
`` Why should you see them , Porthos ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern , and , no doubt , are resting , having accomplished their rough and difficult task . '' 
Aramis stopped Porthos , who was preparing to enter the cavern . 
`` Will you allow me , my friend , '' said he to the giant , `` to pass in first ? 
I know the signal I have given to these men ; who , not hearing it , would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark . ''
