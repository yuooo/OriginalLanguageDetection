`` But some one else besides must come . '' 
A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT 'S CART One evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow ; he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse ; his breath was short and halted at times ; he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before . 
Then , no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation , he made an effort , drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself . 
He put on his old workingman 's clothes . 
As he no longer went out , he had returned to them and preferred them . 
He was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself ; merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead .

He opened the valise and drew from it Cosette 's outfit . 
He spread it out on his bed . 
The Bishop 's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece .
