He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner ; he was still merry and violent as of old , but his merriment had a convulsive harshness , and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection . 
He sometimes said : `` Oh ! 
if he only would return , what a good box on the ear I would give him ! '' 
As for his aunt , she thought too little to love much ; Marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form ; and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had . 
What augmented Father Gillenormand 's secret suffering was , that he locked it all up within his breast , and did not allow its existence to be divined . 
His sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke . 
It sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius , and asked him : `` What is your grandson doing ? '' 
`` What has become of him ? '' 
The old bourgeois replied with a sigh , that he was a sad case , and giving a fillip to his cuff , if he wished to appear gay : `` Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other . '' 
While the old man regretted , Marius applauded himself .
