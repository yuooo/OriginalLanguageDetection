In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived . 
He was making his circuit to Chastelar . 
The mayor came to meet him , and urged him to retrace his steps . 
Cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche , and beyond ; there was danger even with an escort ; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose . 
`` Therefore , '' said the Bishop , `` I intend to go without escort . '' 
`` You do not really mean that , Monseigneur ! '' 
exclaimed the mayor . 
`` I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes , and shall set out in an hour . '' 
`` Set out ? '' 
`` Set out . ''
