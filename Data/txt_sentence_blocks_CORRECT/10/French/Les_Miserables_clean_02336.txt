Man is not a circle with a single centre ; he is an ellipse with a double focus . 
Facts form one of these , and ideas the other . 
Slang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some bad action to perform , disguises itself . 
There it clothes itself in word-masks , in metaphor-rags . 
In this guise it becomes horrible . 
One finds it difficult to recognize . 
Is it really the French tongue , the great human tongue ? 
Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime , and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil . 
It no longer walks , it hobbles ; it limps on the crutch of the Court of Miracles , a crutch metamorphosable into a club ; it is called vagrancy ; every sort of spectre , its dressers , have painted its face , it crawls and rears , the double gait of the reptile . 
Henceforth , it is apt at all roles , it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter , covered with verdigris by the forger , blacked by the soot of the incendiary ; and the murderer applies its rouge .
