Nothing of all this is in existence now . 
The Mondetour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in 1847 , and probably no longer exists at the present moment . 
The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have disappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau . 
As we have already said , Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the rallying-point , of Courfeyrac and his friends . 
It was Grantaire who had discovered Corinthe . 
He had entered it on account of the Carpe horas , and had returned thither on account of the Carpes au gras . 
There they drank , there they ate , there they shouted ; they did not pay much , they paid badly , they did not pay at all , but they were always welcome . 
Father Hucheloup was a jovial host . 
Hucheloup , that amiable man , as was just said , was a wine-shop-keeper with a mustache ; an amusing variety . 
He always had an ill-tempered air , seemed to wish to intimidate his customers , grumbled at the people who entered his establishment , and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup .
