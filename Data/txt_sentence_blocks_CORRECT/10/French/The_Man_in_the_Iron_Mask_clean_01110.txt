Ah ! 
dame ! 
you were not the captain of the musketeers at that time , Monsieur d'Artagnan . ''

`` Never mind that , it was a good time , seeing that it is always a good time when we are young . 
Good day , monsieur the keeper of the harriers . '' 
`` You do me honor , monsieur le comte , '' said the latter . 
D'Artagnan made no reply . 
The title of comte had hardly struck him ; D'Artagnan had been a comte four years .
