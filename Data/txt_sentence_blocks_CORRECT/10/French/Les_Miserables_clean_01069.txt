At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left , in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane , he perceived a sort of motionless , black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps . 
It was some one , a man , who had evidently just been posted there , and who was barring the passage and waiting . 
Jean Valjean recoiled . 
The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself , situated between the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Rapee , is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom , -- resulting in disfigurement according to some , and in a transfiguration according to others . 
The market-gardens , the timber-yards , and the old buildings have been effaced . 
To-day , there are brand-new , wide streets , arenas , circuses , hippodromes , railway stations , and a prison , Mazas , there ; progress , as the reader sees , with its antidote . 
Half a century ago , in that ordinary , popular tongue , which is all compounded of traditions , which persists in calling the Institut les Quatre-Nations , and the Opera-Comique Feydeau , the precise spot whither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit Picpus . 
The Porte Saint-Jacques , the Porte Paris , the Barriere des Sergents , the Porcherons , la Galiote , les Celestins , les Capucins , le Mail , la Bourbe , l'Arbre de Cracovie , la Petite-Pologne -- these are the names of old Paris which survive amid the new . 
The memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past . 
Le Petit-Picpus , which , moreover , hardly ever had any existence , and never was more than the outline of a quarter , had nearly the monkish aspect of a Spanish town .
