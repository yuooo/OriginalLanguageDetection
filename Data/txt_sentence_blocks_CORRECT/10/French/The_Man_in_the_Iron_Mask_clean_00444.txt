Chance , thou term ` st thyself , but thou art nothing ; thou inflamest everything with thy breath , crumblest mountains at thy approach , and suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of the Cross of dead wood behind which stand another Power invisible like thyself - whom thou deniest , perhaps , but whose avenging hand is on thee , and hurls thee in the dust dishonored and unnamed ! 
Lost ! 
- I am lost ! 
What can be done ? 
Flee to Belle-Isle ? 
Yes , and leave Porthos behind me , to talk and relate the whole affair to every one ! 
Porthos , too , who will have to suffer for what he has done . 
I will not let poor Porthos suffer . 
He seems like one of the members of my own frame ; and his grief or misfortune would be mine as well . 
Porthos shall leave with me , and shall follow my destiny .
