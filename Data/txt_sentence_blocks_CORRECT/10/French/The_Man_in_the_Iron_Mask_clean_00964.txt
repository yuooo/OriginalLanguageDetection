`` You are right , my friend , but how can we attract them , pray ? '' 
`` By not stirring , my good Porthos . '' 
`` Well ! 
we wo n't stir , then ; but when they are all together - '' `` Then leave it to me , I have an idea . '' 
`` If it is so , and your idea proves a good one - and your idea is most likely to be good - I am satisfied . '' 
`` To your ambuscade , Porthos , and count how many enter . '' 
`` But you , what will you do ? '' 
`` Do n't trouble yourself about me ; I have a task to perform . '' 
`` I think I hear shouts . ''
