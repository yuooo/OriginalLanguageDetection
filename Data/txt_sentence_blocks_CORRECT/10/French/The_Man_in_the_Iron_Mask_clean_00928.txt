why do you specify the fox ? 
It is not the fox alone . 
Pardieu ! 
But do n't you know , Porthos , that after the foxes come hounds , and after hounds men ? '' 
Porthos hung his head . 
As though to confirm the words of Aramis , they heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail . 
Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath , with mingling yelps of triumph . 
`` There are the dogs , plain enough ! '' 
said Aramis , posted on the look-out behind a chink in the rocks ; `` now , who are the huntsmen ? '' 
`` If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria 's , '' replied the sailor , `` he will leave the dogs to hunt the grotto , for he knows them , and will not enter in himself , being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side ; it is there he will wait for him . ''
