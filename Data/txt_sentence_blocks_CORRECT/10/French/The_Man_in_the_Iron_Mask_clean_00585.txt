`` If we had known you had a lady upstairs , '' replied Athos , with his customary coolness , `` we would have asked permission to pay our respects to her . '' 
Planchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance , that he forced the passage , and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son . 
Truchen was quite dressed : in the costume of the shopkeeper 's wife , rich yet coquettish ; German eyes attacking French eyes . 
She left the apartment after two courtesies , and went down into the shop - but not without having listened at the door , to know what Planchet 's gentlemen visitors would say of her . 
Athos suspected that , and therefore turned the conversation accordingly . 
Planchet , on his part , was burning to give explanations , which Athos avoided . 
But , as certain tenacities are stronger than others , Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity , translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus . 
So Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing age , and brought good luck to his business , as Ruth did to Boaz . 
`` You want nothing now , then , but heirs to your property . '' 
`` If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres , '' said Planchet .
