At two o'clock in the morning , the sentinel , who was an old soldier , was relieved , and replaced by a conscript . 
A few moments later , the man with the dogs paid his visit , and went off without noticing anything , except , possibly , the excessive youth and `` the rustic air '' of the `` raw recruit . '' 
Two hours afterwards , at four o'clock , when they came to relieve the conscript , he was found asleep on the floor , lying like a log near Thenardier 's cage . 
As for Thenardier , he was no longer there . 
There was a hole in the ceiling of his cage , and , above it , another hole in the roof . 
One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off , and probably carried away with him , as it was not found . 
They also seized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged . 
The soldier 's bayonet had disappeared . 
At the moment when this discovery was made , it was assumed that Thenardier was out of reach . 
The truth is , that he was no longer in the New Building , but that he was still in great danger .
