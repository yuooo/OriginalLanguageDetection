All at once , Gavroche , pushing his cart in front of him , and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes , found himself face to face with a uniform , a shako , a plume , and a gun . 
For the second time , he stopped short . 
`` Hullo , '' said he , `` it 's him . 
Good day , public order . '' 
Gavroche 's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed . 
`` Where are you going , you rascal ? '' 
shouted the sergeant . 
`` Citizen , '' retorted Gavroche , `` I have n't called you ` bourgeois ' yet . 
Why do you insult me ? ''
