If , at the harvest season , the father of a family has his son away on service in the army , and his daughters at service in the town , and if he is ill and incapacitated , the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation ; and on Sunday , after the mass , all the inhabitants of the village -- men , women , and children -- go to the poor man 's field and do his harvesting for him , and carry his straw and his grain to his granary . '' 
To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said : `` Look at the mountaineers of Devolny , a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years . 
Well , when the father of a family dies , the boys go off to seek their fortunes , leaving the property to the girls , so that they may find husbands . '' 
To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits , and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper , he said : `` Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras ! 
There are three thousand souls of them . 
Mon Dieu ! 
it is like a little republic . 
Neither judge nor bailiff is known there . 
The mayor does everything . 
He allots the imposts , taxes each person conscientiously , judges quarrels for nothing , divides inheritances without charge , pronounces sentences gratuitously ; and he is obeyed , because he is a just man among simple men . ''
