We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these - '' `` Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin .
