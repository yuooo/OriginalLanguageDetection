The mattress was a straw mat , the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff , very warm and almost new . 
This is what the alcove consisted of : -- Three rather long poles , thrust into and consolidated , with the rubbish which formed the floor , that is to say , the belly of the elephant , two in front and one behind , and united by a rope at their summits , so as to form a pyramidal bundle . 
This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it , but artistically applied , and held by fastenings of iron wire , so that it enveloped all three holes . 
A row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it . 
This grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries . 
Gavroche 's bed stood as in a cage , behind this net . 
The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent . 
This trellis-work took the place of curtains . 
Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front , and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart . 
`` Down on all fours , brats ! ''
