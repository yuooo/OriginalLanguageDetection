`` No , '' replied the husband . 
He tapped a third time . 
The husband rose , took the lamp , and went to the door , which he opened . 
He was a man of lofty stature , half peasant , half artisan . 
He wore a huge leather apron , which reached to his left shoulder , and which a hammer , a red handkerchief , a powder-horn , and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle , as in a pocket , caused to bulge out . 
He carried his head thrown backwards ; his shirt , widely opened and turned back , displayed his bull neck , white and bare . 
He had thick eyelashes , enormous black whiskers , prominent eyes , the lower part of his face like a snout ; and besides all this , that air of being on his own ground , which is indescribable . 
`` Pardon me , sir , '' said the wayfarer , `` Could you , in consideration of payment , give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden , in which to sleep ? 
Tell me ; can you ? 
For money ? ''
