They talked to him about it for one day ; it was a moment , a flash , as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved ; then all closed again . 
He heard nothing more forever . 
Nothing from them ever reached him again ; he never beheld them ; he never met them again ; and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more . 
Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean 's turn to escape arrived . 
His comrades assisted him , as is the custom in that sad place . 
He escaped . 
He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty , if being at liberty is to be hunted , to turn the head every instant , to quake at the slightest noise , to be afraid of everything , -- of a smoking roof , of a passing man , of a barking dog , of a galloping horse , of a striking clock , of the day because one can see , of the night because one can not see , of the highway , of the path , of a bush , of sleep . 
On the evening of the second day he was captured . 
He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours . 
The maritime tribunal condemned him , for this crime , to a prolongation of his term for three years , which made eight years .
