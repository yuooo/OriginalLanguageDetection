` Only , do n't do it again , you hussy ! ' 
Oh ! 
I wo n't do it again , Monsieur Javert ! 
They may do whatever they please to me now ; I will not stir . 
But to-day , you see , I cried because it hurt me . 
I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all ; and then as I told you , I am not well ; I have a cough ; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach , and the doctor tells me , ` Take care of yourself . ' 
Here , feel , give me your hand ; do n't be afraid -- it is here . '' 
She no longer wept , her voice was caressing ; she placed Javert 's coarse hand on her delicate , white throat and looked smilingly at him . 
All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments , dropped the folds of her skirt , which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along , almost to the height of her knee , and stepped towards the door , saying to the soldiers in a low voice , and with a friendly nod : -- `` Children , Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released , and I am going . '' 
She laid her hand on the latch of the door .
