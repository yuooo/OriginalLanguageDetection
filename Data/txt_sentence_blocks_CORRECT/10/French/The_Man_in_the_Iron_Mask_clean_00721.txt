`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? ''
