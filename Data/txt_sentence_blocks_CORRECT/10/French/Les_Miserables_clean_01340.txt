The cemetery was closed . 
The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to be apprehended . 
That `` conscript '' was at home busily engaged in looking for his card , and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings , since it was in Fauchelevent 's pocket . 
Without a card , he could not get back into the cemetery . 
Fauchelevent took the shovel , and Jean Valjean the pick-axe , and together they buried the empty coffin . 
When the grave was full , Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean : -- `` Let us go . 
I will keep the shovel ; do you carry off the mattock . '' 
Night was falling . 
Jean Valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking .
