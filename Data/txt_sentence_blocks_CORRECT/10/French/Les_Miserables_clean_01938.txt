I tied that paw for him . '' 
In the meanwhile , the prisoner had begun to speak : -- `` You are wretches , but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it . 
When you think that you can make me speak , that you can make me write what I do not choose to write , that you can make me say what I do not choose to say -- '' He stripped up his left sleeve , and added : -- `` See here . '' 
At the same moment he extended his arm , and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh . 
The crackling of the burning flesh became audible , and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel . 
Marius reeled in utter horror , the very ruffians shuddered , hardly a muscle of the old man 's face contracted , and while the red-hot iron sank into the smoking wound , impassive and almost august , he fixed on Thenardier his beautiful glance , in which there was no hatred , and where suffering vanished in serene majesty . 
With grand and lofty natures , the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth , and make it appear on the brow , just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself . 
`` Wretches ! '' 
said he , `` have no more fear of me than I have for you ! '' 
And , tearing the chisel from the wound , he hurled it through the window , which had been left open ; the horrible , glowing tool disappeared into the night , whirling as it flew , and fell far away on the snow .
