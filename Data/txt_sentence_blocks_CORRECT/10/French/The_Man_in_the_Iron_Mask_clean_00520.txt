Ah ! 
monseigneur , that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul abandoned -- Raoul unhappy ! '' 
Athos then employed the heroic remedy . 
He defended Louise against Raoul , and justified her perfidy by her love . 
`` A woman who would have yielded to a king because he is a king , '' said he , `` would deserve to be styled infamous ; but Louise loves Louis . 
Young , both , they have forgotten , he his rank , she her vows . 
Love absolves everything , Raoul . 
The two young people love each other with sincerity . '' 
And when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust , Athos , with a sigh , saw Raoul bound away beneath the rankling wound , and fly to the thickest recesses of the wood , or the solitude of his chamber , whence , an hour after , he would return , pale , trembling , but subdued . 
Then , coming up to Athos with a smile , he would kiss his hand , like the dog who , having been beaten , caresses a respected master , to redeem his fault .
