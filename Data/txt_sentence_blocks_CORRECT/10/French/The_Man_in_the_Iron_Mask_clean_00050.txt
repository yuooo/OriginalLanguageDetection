`` Monsieur , '' cried the prince , `` would it not have been better for you to have reflected , before telling me all that you have done , that you have broken my heart forever ? '' 
`` And so I desire to do , monseigneur . '' 
`` To talk to me about power , grandeur , eye , and to prate of thrones ! 
Is a prison the fit place ? 
You wish to make me believe in splendor , and we are lying lost in night ; you boast of glory , and we are smothering our words in the curtains of this miserable bed ; you give me glimpses of power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer in the corridor - that step which , after all , makes you tremble more than it does me . 
To render me somewhat less incredulous , free me from the Bastile ; let me breathe the fresh air ; give me my spurs and trusty sword , then we shall begin to understand each other . '' 
`` It is precisely my intention to give you all this , monseigneur , and more ; only , do you desire it ? '' 
`` A word more , '' said the prince . 
`` I know there are guards in every gallery , bolts to every door , cannon and soldiery at every barrier . 
How will you overcome the sentries - spike the guns ?
