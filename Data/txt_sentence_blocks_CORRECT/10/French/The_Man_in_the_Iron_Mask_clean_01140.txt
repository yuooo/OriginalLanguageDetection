And the king turned on his heel , smiling in his brother 's face , to sweeten , as it were , the bitter draught he had given him . 
During this time Colbert was talking with the Duc d'Almeda . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Colbert to Aramis , `` this is the moment for us to come to an understanding . 
I have made your peace with the king , and I owed that clearly to a man of so much merit ; but as you have often expressed friendship for me , an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof of it . 
You are , besides , more a Frenchman than a Spaniard . 
Shall we secure - answer me frankly - the neutrality of Spain , if we undertake anything against the United Provinces ? '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Aramis , `` the interest of Spain is clear . 
To embroil Europe with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy , but the king of France is an ally of the United Provinces . 
You are not ignorant , besides , that it would infer a maritime war , and that France is in no state to undertake this with advantage . '' 
Colbert , turning round at this moment , saw D'Artagnan who was seeking some interlocutor , during this `` aside '' of the king and Monsieur .
