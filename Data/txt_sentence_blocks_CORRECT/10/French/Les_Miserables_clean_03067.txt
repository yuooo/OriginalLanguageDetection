Javert did not recognize Jean Valjean , who , as we have stated , no longer looked like himself . 
He did not unfold his arms , he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist , by an imperceptible movement , and said in a curt , calm voice : `` Who are you ? '' 
`` I. '' `` Who is ` I ' ? '' 
`` Jean Valjean . '' 
Javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth , bent his knees , inclined his body , laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean , which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices , scrutinized him , and recognized him . 
Their faces almost touched . 
Javert 's look was terrible . 
Jean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert 's grasp , like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx . 
`` Inspector Javert , '' said he , `` you have me in your power . 
Moreover , I have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning .
