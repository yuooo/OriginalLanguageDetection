`` Monday , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` No -- to-day is Saturday . '' 
`` Saturday ? 
Impossible ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , yes , yes ! '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` You have made a mistake of one day ! 
We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time ; but there are only ten minutes left ! '' 
Passepartout had seized his master by the collar , and was dragging him along with irresistible force . 
Phileas Fogg , thus kidnapped , without having time to think , left his house , jumped into a cab , promised a hundred pounds to the cabman , and , having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages , reached the Reform Club .
