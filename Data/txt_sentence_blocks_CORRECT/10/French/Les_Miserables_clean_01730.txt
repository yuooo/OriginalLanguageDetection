A ROSE IN MISERY A very young girl was standing in the half-open door . 
The dormer window of the garret , through which the light fell , was precisely opposite the door , and illuminated the figure with a wan light . 
She was a frail , emaciated , slender creature ; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness . 
Her girdle was a string , her head ribbon a string , her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise , a blond and lymphatic pallor , earth-colored collar-bones , red hands , a half-open and degraded mouth , missing teeth , dull , bold , base eyes ; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth , and the look of a corrupt old woman ; fifty years mingled with fifteen ; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible , and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep . 
Marius had risen , and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being , who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams . 
The most heart-breaking thing of all was , that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely . 
In her early childhood she must even have been pretty . 
The grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous , premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty . 
The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen , like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter 's day . 
That face was not wholly unknown to Marius .
