At intervals , as he combated his lassitude , he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind . 
He tried to put to himself , for the last time , and definitely , the problem over which he had , in a manner , fallen prostrate with fatigue : Ought he to denounce himself ? 
Ought he to hold his peace ? 
He could not manage to see anything distinctly . 
The vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished , one after the other , into smoke . 
He only felt that , to whatever course of action he made up his mind , something in him must die , and that of necessity , and without his being able to escape the fact ; that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left ; that he was passing through a death agony , -- the agony of his happiness , or the agony of his virtue . 
Alas ! 
all his resolution had again taken possession of him . 
He was no further advanced than at the beginning . 
Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish .
