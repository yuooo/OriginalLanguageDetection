The trunk had not suffered any internal injury ; a bullet , deadened by the pocket-book , had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration , which was of no great depth , and consequently , not dangerous . 
The long , underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken collar-bone , and the disorder there was serious . 
The arms had been slashed with sabre cuts .

Moreover , the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage . 
From the waist down , the barricade had protected the lower part of the body from injury . 
Basque and Nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages ; Nicolette sewed them , Basque rolled them .
