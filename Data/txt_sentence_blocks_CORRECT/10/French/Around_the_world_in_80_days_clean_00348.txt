Mr. Fogg , at this , rose in his turn . 
There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips . 
Aouda looked into his face . 
The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him . 
He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look . 
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! '' 
he said , simply . 
`` Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Aouda , pressing his hand to her heart .
