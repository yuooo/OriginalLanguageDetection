`` You are the grandchild of Henry IV . 
as well as myself , lady . 
Cousin and brother-in-law , does not that amount pretty well to the title of brother - germain ? ''

`` Let us form an alliance . '' 
`` Begin . '' 
`` I have , you say , unjustly exiled De Guiche . '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes , '' said she , blushing . 
`` De Guiche shall return . ''
