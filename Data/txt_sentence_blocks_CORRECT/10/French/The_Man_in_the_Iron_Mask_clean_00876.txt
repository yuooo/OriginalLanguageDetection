D'Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate , which penetrated that hardened heart . 
`` Dear Porthos ! ''

`` You see what is being done against you , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` interception of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle . 
Your means of transport seized . 
If you had endeavored to fly , you would have fallen into the hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions , on the watch for you . 
The king wants you to be taken , and he will take you . '' 
D'Artagnan tore at his gray mustache .
