-LSB- 18 -RSB- Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air . 
It is in that keel that the titi huddle together . 
The titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva ; the same being endowed with wings and soaring . 
It suffices for him to be there , with his radiance of happiness , with his power of enthusiasm and joy , with his hand-clapping , which resembles a clapping of wings , to confer on that narrow , dark , fetid , sordid , unhealthy , hideous , abominable keel , the name of Paradise .
