The duke looked at his friend , as if desirous to assist him to parry this unexpected blow . 
`` That is difficult , my dear vicomte , very difficult , '' added he , in a lower tone of voice . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , I have been indiscreet , '' replied Raoul , in a firm voice ; `` but as you yourself invited me to wish - '' `` To wish to leave me ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur - can you imagine - '' `` Well , mordieu ! '' 
cried the duke , `` the young vicomte is right ! 
What can he do here ? 
He will go moldy with grief . '' 
Raoul blushed , and the excitable prince continued : `` War is a distraction : we gain everything by it ; we can only lose one thing by it - life - then so much the worse ! ''
