asked Fix , in the most natural tone in the world . 
`` Quite well , and I too . 
I eat like a famished ogre ; it 's the sea air . 
`` But I never see your master on deck . '' 
`` Never ; he has n't the least curiosity . '' 
`` Do you know , Mr. Passepartout , that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand -- perhaps a diplomatic mission ? '' 
`` Faith , Monsieur Fix , I assure you I know nothing about it , nor would I give half a crown to find out . '' 
After this meeting , Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together , the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man 's confidence . 
He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room , which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity , mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows . 
Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly ; on the 13th , Mocha , surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing , was sighted , and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields .
