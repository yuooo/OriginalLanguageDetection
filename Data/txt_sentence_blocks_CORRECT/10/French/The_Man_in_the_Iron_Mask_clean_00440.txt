`` I accept the augury , Monsieur d'Herblay ; but nothing shall prevent me , nothing shall stop me . 
You will leave Vaux - you must leave France ; I give you four hours to place yourself out of the king 's reach . '' 
`` Four hours ? '' 
said Aramis , scornfully and incredulously . 
`` Upon the word of Fouquet , no one shall follow you before the expiration of that time . 
You will therefore have four hours ' advance of those whom the king may wish to dispatch after you . '' 
Four hours ! '' 
repeated Aramis , in a thick , smothered voice . 
`` It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to Belle - Isle , which I give you as a place of refuge . '' 
`` Ah ! ''
