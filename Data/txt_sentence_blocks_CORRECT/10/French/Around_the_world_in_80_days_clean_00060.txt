I quite recognise you . 
You are the servant of the strange Englishman -- '' `` Just so , monsieur -- '' `` Fix . '' 
`` Monsieur Fix , '' resumed Passepartout , `` I 'm charmed to find you on board . 
Where are you bound ? '' 
`` Like you , to Bombay . '' 
`` That 's capital ! 
Have you made this trip before ? '' 
`` Several times . 
I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company . ''
