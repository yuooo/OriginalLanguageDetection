- To the castle , then ! '' 
He returned thither . 
M. de Lyonne was coming out . 
He gave D'Artagnan both hands , but told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening and all night , and that orders had been given that no one should be admitted . 
`` Not even the captain who takes the order ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I think that is rather too strong . '' 
`` Not even he , '' said M. de Lyonne . 
`` Since that is the case , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the heart ; `` since the captain of the musketeers , who has always entered the king 's chamber , is no longer allowed to enter it , his cabinet , or his salle-a - manger , either the king is dead , or his captain is in disgrace . 
Do me the favor , then , M. de Lyonne , who are in favor , to return and tell the king , plainly , I send him my resignation . ''
