`` The devil ! '' 
muttered Passepartout . 
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one . 
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind . 
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one . 
`` Eighty ! 
ninety ! '' 
Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American . 
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people ! 
Sir , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! ''
