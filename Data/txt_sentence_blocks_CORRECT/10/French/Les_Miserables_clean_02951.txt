The musketry of the besiegers , though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards , was deadly . 
The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain , whence dripped long , red and smoking streams , the uproar was indescribable ; a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat . 
Words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch . 
There were no longer men in this conflict , which was now infernal . 
They were no longer giants matched with colossi . 
It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer . 
Demons attacked , spectres resisted . 
It was heroism become monstrous . 
ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK At length , by dint of mounting on each other 's backs , aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase , climbing up the walls , clinging to the ceiling , slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door , the last one who offered resistance , a score of assailants , soldiers , National Guardsmen , municipal guardsmen , in utter confusion , the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent , blinded by blood , furious , rendered savage , made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor . 
There they found only one man still on his feet , Enjolras .
