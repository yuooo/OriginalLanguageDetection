`` That 's true , '' said he , `` both of you together have no more than that . '' 
And , forgetting his motto : `` half shares , '' he took all . 
He hesitated a little over the large sous . 
After due reflection , he took them also , muttering : `` Never mind ! 
You cut folks ' throats too cheap altogether . '' 
That done , he once more drew the big key from under his blouse . 
`` Now , my friend , you must leave . 
It 's like the fair here , you pay when you go out . 
You have paid , now clear out . '' 
And he began to laugh .
