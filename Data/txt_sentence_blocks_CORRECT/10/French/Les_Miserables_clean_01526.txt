His mind had two attitudes , one on the side towards man , the other on that towards God ; he studied or he contemplated . 
All day long , he buried himself in social questions , salary , capital , credit , marriage , religion , liberty of thought , education , penal servitude , poverty , association , property , production and sharing , the enigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness ; and at night , he gazed upon the planets , those enormous beings . 
Like Enjolras , he was wealthy and an only son . 
He spoke softly , bowed his head , lowered his eyes , smiled with embarrassment , dressed badly , had an awkward air , blushed at a mere nothing , and was very timid . 
Yet he was intrepid . 
Feuilly was a workingman , a fan-maker , orphaned both of father and mother , who earned with difficulty three francs a day , and had but one thought , to deliver the world . 
He had one other preoccupation , to educate himself ; he called this also , delivering himself . 
He had taught himself to read and write ; everything that he knew , he had learned by himself . 
Feuilly had a generous heart . 
The range of his embrace was immense .
