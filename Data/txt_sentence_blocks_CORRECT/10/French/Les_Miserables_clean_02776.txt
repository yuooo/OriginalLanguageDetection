These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces . 
The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach . 
All windows and doors were closed . 
In the background rose this barrier , which made a blind thoroughfare of the street , a motionless and tranquil wall ; no one was visible , nothing was audible ; not a cry , not a sound , not a breath . 
A sepulchre . 
The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light . 
It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple . 
As soon as one arrived on the spot , and caught sight of it , it was impossible , even for the boldest , not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition . 
It was adjusted , jointed , imbricated , rectilinear , symmetrical and funereal . 
Science and gloom met there .
