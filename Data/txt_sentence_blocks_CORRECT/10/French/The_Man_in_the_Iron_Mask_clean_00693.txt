: The Last Supper . 
The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching departure , for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends . 
From the bottom to the top of the house , the hurry of the servants bearing dishes , and the diligence of the registres , denoted an approaching change in offices and kitchen . 
D'Artagnan , with his order in his hand , presented himself at the offices , when he was told it was too late to pay cash , the chest was closed . 
He only replied : `` On the king 's service . '' 
The clerk , a little put out by the serious air of the captain , replied , that `` that was a very respectable reason , but that the customs of the house were respectable likewise ; and that , in consequence , he begged the bearer to call again next day . '' 
D'Artagnan asked if he could not see M. Fouquet . 
The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with such details , and rudely closed the outer door in the captain 's face . 
But the latter had foreseen this stroke , and placed his boot between the door and the door-case , so that the lock did not catch , and the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor .
