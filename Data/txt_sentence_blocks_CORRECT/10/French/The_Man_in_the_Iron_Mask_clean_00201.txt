Baisemeaux obeyed . 
He summoned his lieutenant , and gave him an order , which the latter passed on , without disturbing himself about it , to the next whom it concerned . 
Half an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court ; it was the door to the dungeon , which had just rendered up its prey to the free air . 
Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one , which he left burning behind the door . 
This flickering glare prevented the sight from resting steadily on any object . 
It multiplied tenfold the changing forms and shadows of the place , by its wavering uncertainty . 
Steps drew near . 
`` Go and meet your men , '' said Aramis to Baisemeaux . 
The governor obeyed . 
The sergeant and turnkeys disappeared .
