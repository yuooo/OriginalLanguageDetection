There is no longer any bank there now . 
The aspect of the locality has changed . 
On that bank , two men , separated by a certain distance , seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other . 
The one who was in advance was trying to get away , the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other . 
It was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence . 
Neither seemed to be in any hurry , and both walked slowly , as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace . 
One would have said that it was an appetite following its prey , and purposely without wearing the air of doing so . 
The prey was crafty and on its guard . 
The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dog were observed . 
The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance ; the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect , and must have been rude to encounter .
