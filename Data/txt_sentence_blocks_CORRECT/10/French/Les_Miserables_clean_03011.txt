Stupefied , he turned round . 
Behind him , in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through , at a distance which appeared to him immense , piercing the dense obscurity , flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him . 
It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer . 
In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way , black , upright , indistinct , horrible . 
EXPLANATION On the day of the sixth of June , a battue of the sewers had been ordered . 
It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge , and Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General Bugeaud swept public Paris ; a double and connected operation which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force , represented above by the army and below by the police . 
Three squads of agents and sewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris , the first on the right bank , the second on the left bank , the third in the city . 
The agents of police were armed with carabines , with bludgeons , swords and poignards . 
That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment , was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank . 
This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran .
