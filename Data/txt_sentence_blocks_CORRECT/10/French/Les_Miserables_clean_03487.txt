`` Good-day , and farewell , doctor , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Here are my poor children . ''

The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance . 
`` Because things are not agreeable , '' said Jean Valjean , `` that is no reason for being unjust towards God . '' 
A silence ensued . 
All breasts were oppressed .
