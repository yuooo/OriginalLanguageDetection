You understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king 's ears , the king , who had pitied his terrible affliction , and saw that all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude , became perfectly furious ; so that , now - and remember this very distinctly , dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , for it concerns you most closely - so that there is now , I repeat , sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself . 
You understand , Baisemeaux , sentence of death ! '' 
`` You need not ask me whether I understand . '' 
`` And now , let us go down , and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon again , unless you prefer he should come up here . '' 
`` What would be the good of that ? '' 
`` It would be better , perhaps , to enter his name in the prison-book at once ! '' 
`` Of course , certainly ; not a doubt of it . '' 
`` In that case , have him up . '' 
Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung , as a warning to every one to retire , in order to avoid meeting a prisoner , about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery .
