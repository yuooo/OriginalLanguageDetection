`` See if M. d'Artagnan has returned . '' 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` It is very strange , '' murmured the king . 
`` Call M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert entered ; he had been expecting this all the morning . 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' said the king , very sharply ; `` you must ascertain what has become of M. d'Artagnan . '' 
Colbert in his calm voice replied , `` Where does your majesty desire him to be sought for ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur ! 
do you not know on what I have sent him ? ''
