Later on , indulgence and kindness saved me , as severity had ruined me . 
But , pardon me , you can not understand what I am saying . 
You will find at my house , among the ashes in the fireplace , the forty-sou piece which I stole , seven years ago , from little Gervais . 
I have nothing farther to add ; take me . 
Good God !

you do not believe me ! 
that is distressing . 
Do not , at least , condemn this man !
