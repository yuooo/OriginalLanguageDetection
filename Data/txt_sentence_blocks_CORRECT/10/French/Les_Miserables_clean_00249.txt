This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry . 
Jean Valjean shuddered . 
The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of Judgment . 
In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated , and had suddenly assumed a terrible life , and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one , and warn and to wake those who were asleep . 
He halted , shuddering , bewildered , and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels . 
He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers , and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern . 
It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household , like the shock of an earthquake ; the door , pushed by him , had taken the alarm , and had shouted ; the old man would rise at once ; the two old women would shriek out ; people would come to their assistance ; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar , and the gendarmerie on hand . 
For a moment he thought himself lost . 
He remained where he was , petrified like the statue of salt , not daring to make a movement . 
Several minutes elapsed .
