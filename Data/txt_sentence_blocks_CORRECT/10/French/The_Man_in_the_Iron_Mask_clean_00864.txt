`` Oh !

`` Ah ! 
but - '' `` And so , according to this , the duchy that was promised me - '' `` It was the usurper that was to give it to you . '' 
`` And that is not the same thing , Aramis , '' said Porthos , majestically . 
`` My friend , if it had only depended upon me , you should have become a prince . ''
