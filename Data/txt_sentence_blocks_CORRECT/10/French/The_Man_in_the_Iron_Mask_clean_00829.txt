`` And from Angers , '' continued the king , `` they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile , in Paris . '' 
`` You were right , '' said the captain to the minister . 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' continued the king , `` you will have any one shot who shall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet , during the journey . '' 
`` But myself , sire , '' said the duke . 
`` You , monsieur , you will only speak to him in the presence of the musketeers . '' 
The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission . 
D'Artagnan was about to retire likewise ; but the king stopped him . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you will go immediately , and take possession of the isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . 
Alone ? ''
