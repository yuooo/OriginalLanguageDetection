`` I will go and ask him to come up here , presently , after I have spoken to you . '' 
`` Do so , mademoiselle . '' 
`` Are you angry with me ? '' 
Raoul looked at her for a moment , then , casting down his eyes , `` Yes , '' said he . 
`` You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture , do you not ? '' 
`` Rupture ! '' 
said he , with bitterness . 
`` Oh ! 
mademoiselle , there can be no rupture where there has been no love . ''
