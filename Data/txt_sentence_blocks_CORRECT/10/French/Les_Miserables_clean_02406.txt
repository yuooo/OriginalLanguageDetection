It was , in fact , Eponine , who had addressed Thenardier . 
At the apparition of Eponine , the other five , that is to say , Claquesous , Guelemer , Babet , Brujon , and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near , without precipitation , without uttering a word , with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night . 
Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands . 
Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons . 
`` Ah , see here , what are you about there ? 
What do you want with us ? 
Are you crazy ? '' 
exclaimed Thenardier , as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low ; `` what have you come here to hinder our work for ? '' 
Eponine burst out laughing , and threw herself on his neck .
