What am I ? 
A little dust collected in an organism . 
What am I to do on this earth ? 
The choice rests with me : suffer or enjoy . 
Whither will suffering lead me ? 
To nothingness ; but I shall have suffered . 
Whither will enjoyment lead me ? 
To nothingness ; but I shall have enjoyed myself . 
My choice is made . 
One must eat or be eaten .
