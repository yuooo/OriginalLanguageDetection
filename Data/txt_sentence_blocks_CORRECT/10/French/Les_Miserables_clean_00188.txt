It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed ! 
You actually do not want me to go ! 
You are good people . 
Besides , I have money . 
I will pay well . 
Pardon me , monsieur the inn-keeper , but what is your name ? 
I will pay anything you ask . 
You are a fine man . 
You are an inn-keeper , are you not ? '' 
`` I am , '' replied the Bishop , `` a priest who lives here . ''
