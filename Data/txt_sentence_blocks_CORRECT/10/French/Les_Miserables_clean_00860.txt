He is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty , to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers . 
This sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs . 
If the indictment is to be trusted , he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone , and it has not been possible to lay hands on it . 
However that may be , the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence , about eight years ago , on the person of one of those honest children who , as the patriarch of Ferney has said , in immortal verse , '' ... Arrive from Savoy every year , And who , with gentle hands , do clear Those long canals choked up with soot . '' 
This bandit refused to defend himself . 
It was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor , that the theft was committed in complicity with others , and that Jean Valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south . 
Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence . 
This criminal refused to lodge an appeal . 
The king , in his inexhaustible clemency , has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life . 
Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon .
