At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes , serious and with sword in fist . 
This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier , the last was barely debauching from the boulevard . 
A throng , sprung , it is impossible to say whence , and formed in a twinkling , as is frequently the case in Paris , pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on . 
In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible . 
The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence . 
They were livid with the chill of morning . 
They all wore linen trousers , and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes . 
The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness . 
Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous ; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags . 
Battered felt hats , tarpaulin caps , hideous woollen nightcaps , and , side by side with a short blouse , a black coat broken at the elbow ; many wore women 's headgear , others had baskets on their heads ; hairy breasts were visible , and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried ; temples of Love , flaming hearts , Cupids ; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen .
