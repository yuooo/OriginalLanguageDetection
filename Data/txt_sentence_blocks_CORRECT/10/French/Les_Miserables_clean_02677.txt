The vidette of the Lane des Precheurs had remained at his post , which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles . 
The Rue de la Chanvrerie , of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag , offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke . 
Each man had taken up his position for the conflict . 
Forty-three insurgents , among whom were Enjolras , Combeferre , Courfeyrac , Bossuet , Joly , Bahorel , and Gavroche , were kneeling inside the large barricade , with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier , the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop-holes , attentive , mute , ready to fire . 
Six , commanded by Feuilly , had installed themselves , with their guns levelled at their shoulders , at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe . 
Several minutes passed thus , then a sound of footsteps , measured , heavy , and numerous , became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu . 
This sound , faint at first , then precise , then heavy and sonorous , approached slowly , without halt , without intermission , with a tranquil and terrible continuity . 
Nothing was to be heard but this . 
It was that combined silence and sound , of the statue of the commander , but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng , and , at the same time , the idea of a spectre . 
One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward .
