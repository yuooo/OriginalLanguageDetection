This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden . 
At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated , one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom . 
Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees . 
They knew not what it was , they knew not where they were ; but both of them , the man and the child , the penitent and the innocent , felt that they must kneel . 
These voices had this strange characteristic , that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted . 
It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house . 
While these voices were singing , Jean Valjean thought of nothing . 
He no longer beheld the night ; he beheld a blue sky . 
It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us , unfolding . 
The song died away .
