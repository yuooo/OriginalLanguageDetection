When he came down again the portress interrogated him : `` Well , doctor ? '' 
`` Your sick man is very ill indeed . '' 
`` What is the matter with him ? '' 
`` Everything and nothing . 
He is a man who , to all appearances , has lost some person who is dear to him . 
People die of that . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` He told me that he was in good health . '' 
`` Shall you come again , doctor ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the doctor .
