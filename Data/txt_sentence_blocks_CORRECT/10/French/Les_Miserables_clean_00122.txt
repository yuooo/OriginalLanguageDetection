The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor . 
He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard , a member of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz , as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle . 
This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks , which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches . 
After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor , he never dressed himself in his regimentals , as he said , so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross . 
He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him ; this made a hole , and he would not put anything in its place . 
`` I will die , '' he said , `` rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart ! '' 
He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII . 
`` The gouty old creature in English gaiters ! '' 
he said ; `` let him take himself off to Prussia with that queue of his . '' 
He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested , Prussia and England .
