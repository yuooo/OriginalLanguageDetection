When Porthos enjoined Raoul de Bragelonne to give D'Artagnan all that he would ask , he knew well , our worthy Porthos , that D'Artagnan would ask or take nothing ; and in case he did demand anything , none but himself could say what . 
Porthos left a pension to Aramis , who , if he should be inclined to ask too much , was checked by the example of D'Artagnan ; and that word exile , thrown out by the testator , without apparent intention , was it not the mildest , most exquisite criticism upon that conduct of Aramis which had brought about the death of Porthos ? 
But there was no mention of Athos in the testament of the dead . 
Could the latter for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the father ? 
The rough mind of Porthos had fathomed all these causes , seized all these shades more clearly than law , better than custom , with more propriety than taste . 
`` Porthos had indeed a heart , '' said D'Artagnan to himself with a sigh . 
As he made this reflection , he fancied he hard a groan in the room above him ; and he thought immediately of poor Mousqueton , whom he felt it was a pleasing duty to divert from his grief . 
For this purpose he left the hall hastily to seek the worthy intendant , as he had not returned . 
He ascended the staircase leading to the first story , and perceived , in Porthos 's own chamber , a heap of clothes of all colors and materials , upon which Mousqueton had laid himself down after heaping them all on the floor together . 
It was the legacy of the faithful friend .
