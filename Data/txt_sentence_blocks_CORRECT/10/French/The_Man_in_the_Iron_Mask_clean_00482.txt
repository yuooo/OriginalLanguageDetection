`` Oh ! 
I understand , then , you ask me to forgive your friends . '' 
`` My friends ! '' 
said Fouquet , deeply wounded . 
`` Your friends , certainly ; but the safety of the state requires that an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty . '' 
`` I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just restored you to liberty , and have saved your life . '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
`` I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d'Herblay wished to carry out his character of an assassin , he could very easily have assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart , and all would have been over . '' 
The king started . 
`` A pistol-bullet through the head , '' pursued Fouquet , `` and the disfigured features of Louis XIV. , which no one could have recognized , would be M. d'Herblay 's complete and entire justification . ''
