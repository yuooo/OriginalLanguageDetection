`` I do n't know whether you can , sir ; but you ought to do so . '' 
`` Nobody here , '' returned the other , `` has a right to teach me my duty . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg , coldly . 
`` I will go alone . '' 
`` You , sir ! '' 
cried Fix , coming up ; `` you go alone in pursuit of the Indians ? '' 
`` Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish -- him to whom every one present owes his life ? 
I shall go . '' 
`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself .
