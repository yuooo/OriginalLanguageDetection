The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose , with two deep nostrils , towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks . 
One felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time . 
When Javert laughed , -- and his laugh was rare and terrible , -- his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth , but his gums , and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold , as on the muzzle of a wild beast . 
Javert , serious , was a watchdog ; when he laughed , he was a tiger . 
As for the rest , he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw ; his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows ; between his eyes there was a permanent , central frown , like an imprint of wrath ; his gaze was obscure ; his mouth pursed up and terrible ; his air that of ferocious command . 
This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments , comparatively ; but he rendered them almost bad , by dint of exaggerating them , -- respect for authority , hatred of rebellion ; and in his eyes , murder , robbery , all crimes , are only forms of rebellion . 
He enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state , from the prime minister to the rural policeman . 
He covered with scorn , aversion , and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil . 
He was absolute , and admitted no exceptions . 
On the one hand , he said , `` The functionary can make no mistake ; the magistrate is never the wrong . ''
