Then these men were seen to be in motion , and as in the good old times of Louis XIII . 
and M. de Treville , groups were formed , and staircases were filled ; vague murmurs , issuing from the court below , came rolling to the upper stories , like the distant moaning of the waves . 
M. de Gesvres became uneasy . 
He looked at his guards , who , after being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks , began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence . 
D'Artagnan was certainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres , the captain of the guards . 
As soon as he entered , he seated himself on the ledge of a window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without the least emotion . 
No step of the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him . 
He foresaw the very moment the explosion would take place ; and we know that his previsions were in general correct . 
`` It would be very whimsical , '' thought he , `` if , this evening , my praetorians should make me king of France . 
How I should laugh ! ''
