`` The speculation ! '' 
`` I mean - '' interrupted Planchet , quite confused . 
`` Well , well ; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question ; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you . 
Since the captain of the musketeers is not here , and as we can not learn from you where we are likely to find M. d'Artagnan , we will take our leave of you . 
Au revoir , Planchet , au revoir . 
Let us be gone , Raoul . '' 
`` Monsieur le comte , I wish I were able to tell you - '' `` Oh , not at all ; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion . '' 
This word `` servant '' struck rudely on the ears of the demi-millionnaire Planchet , but natural respect and bonhomie prevailed over pride . 
`` There is nothing indiscreet in telling you , monsieur le comte , M. d'Artagnan came here the other day - '' `` Aha ? '' 
`` And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart . ''
