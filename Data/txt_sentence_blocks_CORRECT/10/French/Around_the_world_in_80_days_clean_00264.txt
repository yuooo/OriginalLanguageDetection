`` I know it , '' said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . '' 
`` Doubtless , '' urged Passepartout , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What ! 
Prudent ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . 
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! '' 
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated Passepartout ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who ! 
What ! 
What 's the matter with this fellow ? '' 
cried several .
