And she hummed vaguely , with these figures : -- `` It must be , said a warrior . '' 
`` I will pay it , '' said the mother . 
`` I have eighty francs . 
I shall have enough left to reach the country , by travelling on foot . 
I shall earn money there , and as soon as I have a little I will return for my darling . '' 
The man 's voice resumed : -- `` The little one has an outfit ? '' 
`` That is my husband , '' said the Thenardier . 
`` Of course she has an outfit , the poor treasure . 
-- I understood perfectly that it was your husband .
