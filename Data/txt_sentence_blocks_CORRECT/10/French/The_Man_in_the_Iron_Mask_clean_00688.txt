`` I have rested , sire . '' 
`` That is well . 
Then between this and to-morrow evening , when you please . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave ; but , perceiving the king very much embarrassed , `` Will you majesty , '' said he , stepping two paces forward , `` take the court with you ? '' 
`` Certainly I shall . '' 
`` Then you majesty will , doubtless , want the musketeers ? '' 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain . 
`` Take a brigade of them , '' replied Louis . 
`` Is that all ? 
Has your majesty no other orders to give me ? ''
