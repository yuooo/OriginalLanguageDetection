cried the duchesse to the coachman . 
And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine , after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet , the last defender of Belle-Isle , the former friend of Marie Michon , the new foe of the old duchesse .

D'Artagnan had set off ; Fouquet likewise was gone , and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends . 
The first moments of this journey , or better say , this flight , were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive . 
It was not natural , in fact , if Louis XIV . 
was determined to seize this prey , that he should allow it to escape ; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase , and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted . 
But insensibly all fears were dispersed ; the surintendant , by hard traveling , placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors , that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him . 
As to his position , his friends had made it excellent for him .
