Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter . 
The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours . 
Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day , October 25th , at noon , for Hong Kong . 
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station , whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet , a dress , shawl , and some furs ; for which his master gave him unlimited credit . 
Passepartout started off forthwith , and found himself in the streets of Allahabad , that is , the City of God , one of the most venerated in India , being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers , Ganges and Jumna , the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula . 
The Ganges , according to the legends of the Ramayana , rises in heaven , whence , owing to Brahma 's agency , it descends to the earth . 
Passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city . 
It was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison ; its commerce has dwindled away , and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street . 
At last he came upon an elderly , crusty Jew , who sold second-hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter-skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds . 
He then returned triumphantly to the station .
