`` Light it ! '' 
`` Stop , '' said Aramis , `` till they are all massed together , and then , my Jupiter , hurl your thunderbolt among them . '' 
`` Light it , '' repeated Porthos . 
`` On my part , '' continued Aramis , `` I will join our Bretons , and help them to get the canoe to the sea . 
I will wait for you on the shore ; launch it strongly , and hasten to us . '' 
`` Light it , '' said Porthos , a third time . 
`` But do you understand me ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Porthos again , with laughter that he did not even attempt to restrain , `` when a thing is explained to me I understand it ; begone , and give me the light . '' 
Aramis gave the burning match to Porthos , who held out his arm to him , his hands being engaged .
