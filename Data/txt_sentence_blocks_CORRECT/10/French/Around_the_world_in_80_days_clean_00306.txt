Passepartout , revolver in hand , held himself ready to fire on those which came too near . 
Had an accident then happened to the sledge , the travellers , attacked by these beasts , would have been in the most terrible danger ; but it held on its even course , soon gained on the wolves , and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind . 
About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the Platte River . 
He said nothing , but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha . 
In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails , whilst the sledge , carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it , went on half a mile further with its sails unspread . 
It stopped at last , and Mudge , pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow , said : `` We have got there ! '' 
Arrived ! 
Arrived at the station which is in daily communication , by numerous trains , with the Atlantic seaboard ! 
Passepartout and Fix jumped off , stretched their stiffened limbs , and aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge . 
Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge , whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped , and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station .
