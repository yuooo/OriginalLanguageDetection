`` I shall be made a duke ! '' 
said Porthos , aloud . 
He was speaking to himself . 
`` That is possible , '' replied Aramis , smiling after his own fashion , as Porthos 's horse passed him . 
Aramis felt , notwithstanding , as though his brain were on fire ; the activity of the body had not yet succeeded in subduing that of the mind .
