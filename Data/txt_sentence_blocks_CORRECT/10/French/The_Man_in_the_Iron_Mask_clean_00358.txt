The wax-lights were dying away in their sockets , the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands , the groups of dancers and courtiers were separating in the salons . 
Surrounded by his friends , who complimented him and received his flattering remarks in return , the surintendant half-closed his wearied eyes . 
He longed for rest and quiet ; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped up for him for so many days past ; it might almost have been said that he seemed bowed beneath the weight of the new debts which he had incurred for the purpose of giving the greatest possible honor to this fete . 
Fouquet had just retired to his room , still smiling , but more than half - asleep . 
He could listen to nothing more , he could hardly keep his eyes open ; his bed seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible attraction for him . 
The god Morpheus , the presiding deity of the dome painted by Lebrun , had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms , and showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the house . 
Fouquet , almost entirely alone , was being assisted by his valet de chambre to undress , when M. d'Artagnan appeared at the entrance of the room . 
D'Artagnan had never been able to succeed in making himself common at the court ; and notwithstanding he was seen everywhere and on all occasions , he never failed to produce an effect wherever and whenever he made his appearance . 
Such is the happy privilege of certain natures , which in that respect resemble either thunder or lightning ; every one recognizes them ; but their appearance never fails to arouse surprise and astonishment , and whenever they occur , the impression is always left that the last was the most conspicuous or most important . 
`` What !
