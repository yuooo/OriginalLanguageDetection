They ate each other somewhat , it is true , which is the misery of evil mixed with good ; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach . 
The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain , and , rather bewildered by all this light , they tried to hide themselves , the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence ; and they kept behind the swans ' hutch . 
Here and there , at intervals , when the wind blew , shouts , clamor , a sort of tumultuous death rattle , which was the firing , and dull blows , which were discharges of cannon , struck the ear confusedly . 
Smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the Halles . 
A bell , which had the air of an appeal , was ringing in the distance . 
These children did not appear to notice these noises . 
The little one repeated from time to time : `` I am hungry . '' 
Almost at the same instant with the children , another couple approached the great basin . 
They consisted of a goodman , about fifty years of age , who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six . 
No doubt , a father and his son .
