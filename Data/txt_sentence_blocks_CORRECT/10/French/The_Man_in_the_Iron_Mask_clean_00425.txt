`` Well , well , '' said Fouquet , `` I understand you ; you have relied upon me to repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis XIV . 
You have thought well ; I will help you . 
I thank you , D'Herblay , I thank you . '' 
`` Oh , no , it is not that at all ; you have not allowed me to finish , '' said Aramis , perfectly unmoved . 
`` I will not say another word , then . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , I was observing , the minister of the reigning sovereign , was suddenly taken into the greatest aversion , and menaced with the ruin of his fortune , loss of liberty , loss of life even , by intrigue and personal hatred , to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear . 
But Heaven permits -LRB- still , however , out of consideration for the unhappy prince who had been sacrificed -RRB- that M. Fouquet should in his turn have a devoted friend who knew this state secret , and felt that he possessed strength and courage enough to divulge this secret , after having had the strength to carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years . 
`` Go no farther , '' said Fouquet , full of generous feelings . 
`` I understand you , and can guess everything now . 
You went to see the king when the intelligence of my arrest reached you ; you implored him , he refused to listen to you ; then you threatened him with that secret , threatened to reveal it , and Louis XIV. , alarmed at the risk of its betrayal , granted to the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous intercession .
