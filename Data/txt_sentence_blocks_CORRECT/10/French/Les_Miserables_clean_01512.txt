It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged . 
On the one hand was a sacred grave , on the other hoary locks . 
He stood there for several moments , staggering as though intoxicated , with all this whirlwind dashing through his head ; then he raised his eyes , gazed fixedly at his grandfather , and cried in a voice of thunder : -- `` Down with the Bourbons , and that great hog of a Louis XVIII . ! '' 
Louis XVIII . 
had been dead for four years ; but it was all the same to him . 
The old man , who had been crimson , turned whiter than his hair . 
He wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry , which stood on the chimney-piece , and made a profound bow , with a sort of peculiar majesty . 
Then he paced twice , slowly and in silence , from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace , traversing the whole length of the room , and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking . 
On his second turn , he bent over his daughter , who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb , and said to her with a smile that was almost calm : `` A baron like this gentleman , and a bourgeois like myself can not remain under the same roof . '' 
And drawing himself up , all at once , pallid , trembling , terrible , with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath , he extended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him : -- `` Be off ! ''
