I carry good luck with me , vicomte , '' said he to Raoul ; `` wish for something while drinking out of my glass , and may the black plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass ! '' 
He held the goblet to Raoul , who hastily moistened his lips , and replied with the same promptitude : `` I have wished for something , monseigneur . '' 
His eyes sparkled with a gloomy fire , and the blood mounted to his cheeks ; he terrified Athos , if only with his smile . 
`` And what have you wished for ? '' 
replied the duke , sinking back into his fauteuil , whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud , and with the other gave him a purse . 
`` Will you promise me , monseigneur , to grant me what I wish for ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
That is agreed upon . '' 
`` I wished , monsieur le duc , to go with you to Gigelli . '' 
Athos became pale , and was unable to conceal his agitation .
