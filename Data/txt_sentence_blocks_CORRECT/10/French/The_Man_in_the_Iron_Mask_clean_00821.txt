`` M. Fouquet , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` is in the iron cage that M. Colbert had prepared for him , and is galloping as fast as four strong horses can drag him , towards Angers . '' 
`` Why did you leave him on the road ? '' 
`` Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers . 
The proof , the best proof of what I advance , is that the king desired me to be sought for but this minute . 
And then I had another reason . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Whilst I was with him , poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the king , astonished . 
`` Your majesty ought to understand , and does understand , certainly , that my warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty .
