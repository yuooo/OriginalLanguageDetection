At last , one day when she was in the garden , she heard poor old Toussaint saying : `` Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing , sir ? '' 
Cosette did not hear her father 's reply , but Toussaint 's words caused a sort of commotion within her . 
She fled from the garden , ran up to her room , flew to the looking-glass , -- it was three months since she had looked at herself , -- and gave vent to a cry . 
She had just dazzled herself . 
She was beautiful and lovely ; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint and her mirror .
