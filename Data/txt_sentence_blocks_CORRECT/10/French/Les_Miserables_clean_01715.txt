Neither M. Leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden . 
Thenceforth , Marius had but one thought , -- to gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face . 
He sought constantly , he sought everywhere ; he found nothing . 
He was no longer Marius , the enthusiastic dreamer , the firm , resolute , ardent man , the bold defier of fate , the brain which erected future on future , the young spirit encumbered with plans , with projects , with pride , with ideas and wishes ; he was a lost dog . 
He fell into a black melancholy . 
All was over . 
Work disgusted him , walking tired him . 
Vast nature , formerly so filled with forms , lights , voices , counsels , perspectives , horizons , teachings , now lay empty before him . 
It seemed to him that everything had disappeared . 
He thought incessantly , for he could not do otherwise ; but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts .
