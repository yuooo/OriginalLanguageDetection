It was not dawn , it was daybreak ; a delightful and stern moment . 
A few constellations here and there in the deep , pale azure , the earth all black , the heavens all white , a quiver amid the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight . 
A lark , which seemed mingled with the stars , was carolling at a prodigious height , and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity . 
In the East , the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel ; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice . 
All was peace and silence ; there was no one on the road ; a few stray laborers , of whom they caught barely a glimpse , were on their way to their work along the side-paths . 
Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber-yard . 
His face was turned towards the highway , his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising ; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated , which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls . 
There are meditations which may be called vertical ; when one is at the bottom of them , time is required to return to earth . 
Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries . 
He was thinking of Cosette , of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her , of the light with which she filled his life , a light which was but the emanation of her soul .
