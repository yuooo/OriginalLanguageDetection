A minute more , and they were both in the fire . 
At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting : `` Jean Valjean ! 
Jean Valjean ! '' 
His hair rose upright : he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing . 
`` Yes , that 's it ! 
finish ! '' 
said the voice . 
`` Complete what you are about ! 
Destroy these candlesticks ! 
Annihilate this souvenir !
