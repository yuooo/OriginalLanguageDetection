Every man has his own peculiar secrets with which others have nothing to do .

`` Well , then , I tell you , you could not have called loud enough , or Aramis would have heard you . '' 
`` However softly any one may call Aramis , monseigneur , Aramis always hears when he has an interest in hearing . 
I repeat what I said before - Aramis was not in his own room , or Aramis had certain reasons for not recognizing my voice , of which I am ignorant , and of which you may be even ignorant yourself , notwithstanding your liege-man is His Greatness the Lord Bishop of Vannes . '' 
Fouquet drew a deep sigh , rose from his seat , took three or four turns in his room , and finished by seating himself , with an expression of extreme dejection , upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings , and costliest lace . 
D'Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the deepest and sincerest pity . 
`` I have seen a good many men arrested in my life , '' said the musketeer , sadly ; `` I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested , though I was very young then . 
I have seen M. de Conde arrested with the princes ; I have seen M. de Retz arrested ; I have seen M. Broussel arrested . 
Stay a moment , monseigneur , it is disagreeable to have to say , but the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was that poor fellow Broussel .
