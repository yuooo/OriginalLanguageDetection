Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! ''
