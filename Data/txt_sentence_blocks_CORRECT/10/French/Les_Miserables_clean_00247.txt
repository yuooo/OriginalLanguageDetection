It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed . 
Perhaps it was a lever ; possibly it was a club . 
In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner 's candlestick . 
Convicts were , at that period , sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon , and it was not rare for them to have miners ' tools at their command . 
These miners ' candlesticks are of massive iron , terminated at the lower extremity by a point , by means of which they are stuck into the rock . 
He took the candlestick in his right hand ; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread , he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room , occupied by the Bishop , as we already know . 
On arriving at this door , he found it ajar . 
The Bishop had not closed it . 
WHAT HE DOES Jean Valjean listened . 
Not a sound .
