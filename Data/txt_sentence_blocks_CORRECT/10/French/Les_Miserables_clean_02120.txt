Beloved by Cosette , he felt that he was healed , rested , appeased , loaded with benefits , recompensed , crowned . 
Beloved by Cosette , it was well with him ! 
He asked nothing more ! 
Had any one said to him : `` Do you want anything better ? '' 
he would have answered : `` No . '' 
God might have said to him : `` Do you desire heaven ? '' 
and he would have replied : `` I should lose by it . '' 
Everything which could affect this situation , if only on the surface , made him shudder like the beginning of something new . 
He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means ; but he understood instinctively , that it was something terrible .
