It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police , and to guard themselves well , and care must be taken to duly close , bar and barricade their houses , and to fasten the doors well . 
Madame Magloire emphasized these last words ; but the Bishop had just come from his room , where it was rather cold . 
He seated himself in front of the fire , and warmed himself , and then fell to thinking of other things . 
He did not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame Magloire . 
She repeated it . 
Then Mademoiselle Baptistine , desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother , ventured to say timidly : -- `` Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying , brother ? '' 
`` I have heard something of it in a vague way , '' replied the Bishop . 
Then half-turning in his chair , placing his hands on his knees , and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face , which so easily grew joyous , and which was illuminated from below by the firelight , -- `` Come , what is the matter ? 
What is the matter ? 
Are we in any great danger ? ''
