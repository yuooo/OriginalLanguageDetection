`` Yes , my sister ; and then , instead of embraces and feasts , it is soldiers - it is soldiers all alive and well equipped - that we must serve up to our friends ; vessels we must offer , all armed with cannons and stored with provisions . 
It hence results that we have not always coffers in a fit condition for such friendships . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are quite right , '' said Madame ; `` the coffers of the king of England have been sonorous for some time . '' 
`` But you , my sister , who have so much influence over your brother , you can secure more than an ambassador could ever get the promise of . '' 
`` To effect that I must go to London , my dear brother . '' 
`` I have thought so , '' replied the king , eagerly ; `` and I have said to myself that such a voyage would do your health and spirits good . '' 
`` Only , '' interrupted Madame , `` it is possible I should fail . 
The king of England has dangerous counselors . '' 
`` Counselors , do you say ? ''
