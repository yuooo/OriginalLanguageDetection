`` To gain time ! '' 
cried the prisoner in a thundering voice , and at the same instant he shook off his bonds ; they were cut . 
The prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg . 
Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward , he had bent down into the fireplace , had stretched out his hand to the brazier , and had then straightened himself up again , and now Thenardier , the female Thenardier , and the ruffians , huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel , stared at him in stupefaction , as almost free and in a formidable attitude , he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel , which emitted a threatening glow . 
The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house eventually gave rise , established the fact that a large sou piece , cut and worked in a peculiar fashion , was found in the garret , when the police made their descent on it . 
This sou piece was one of those marvels of industry , which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows , marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape . 
These hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers ' work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry . 
There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys , just as there are Villons in language . 
The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools , sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife , to saw a sou into two thin plates , to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp , and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again . 
This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will ; it is a box .
