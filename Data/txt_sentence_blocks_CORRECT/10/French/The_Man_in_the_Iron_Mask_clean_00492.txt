He smiled at seeing these countenances , but trembled on recognizing his mother . 
That still so noble and imposing figure , ravaged by pain , pleaded in his heart the cause of the famous queen who had immolated a child to reasons of state . 
He found his mother still handsome . 
He knew that Louis XIV . 
loved her , and he promised himself to love her likewise , and not to prove a scourge to her old age . 
He contemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be understood . 
The latter had usurped nothing , had cast no shades athwart his life . 
A separate tree , he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its elevation or majestic life . 
Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother to this prince , who required nothing but gold to minister to his pleasures . 
He bowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan , who was all reverences and smiles , and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta , his sister-in-law , whose beauty struck him ; but he saw in the eyes of that princess an expression of coldness which would facilitate , as he thought , their future relations .
