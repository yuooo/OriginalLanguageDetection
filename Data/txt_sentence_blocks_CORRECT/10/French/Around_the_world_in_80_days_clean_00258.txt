Between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . 
On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River , one of the great tributaries of the Missouri . 
At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed . 
There was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . 
The snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . 
Large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . 
No wild beast appeared on the plain . 
It was a desert in its vast nakedness . 
After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , Mr. Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped . 
Passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view .
