If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had ! 
In the first place , she will have very beautiful hands ; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old ; like this ! 
she must be a big girl now ; she is seven years old ; she is quite a young lady ; I call her Cosette , but her name is really Euphrasie . 
Stop ! 
this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece , and I had a sort of idea come across me , like that , that I should see Cosette again soon . 
Mon Dieu ! 
how wrong it is not to see one 's children for years ! 
One ought to reflect that life is not eternal . 
Oh , how good M. le Maire is to go ! 
it is very cold !
