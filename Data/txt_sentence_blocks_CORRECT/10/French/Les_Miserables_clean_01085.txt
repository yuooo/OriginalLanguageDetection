Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them . 
The upper story had scuttles like prisons . 
One of those facades cast its shadow on the other , which fell over the garden like an immense black pall . 
No other house was visible . 
The bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness . 
Nevertheless , walls could be confusedly made out , which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond , and the low roofs of the Rue Polonceau . 
Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined . 
There was no one in it , which was quite natural in view of the hour ; but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in , even in broad daylight . 
Jean Valjean 's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again , then to step under the shed with Cosette . 
A man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden .
