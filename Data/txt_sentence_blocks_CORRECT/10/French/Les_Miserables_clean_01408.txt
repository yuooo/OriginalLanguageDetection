He always thrust his hands into his fobs . 
He said authoritatively : `` The French Revolution is a heap of blackguards . '' 
LUC-ESPRIT At the age of sixteen , one evening at the opera , he had had the honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same time -- ripe and celebrated beauties then , and sung by Voltaire , the Camargo and the Salle . 
Caught between two fires , he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer , a young girl named Nahenry , who was sixteen like himself , obscure as a cat , and with whom he was in love . 
He abounded in memories . 
He was accustomed to exclaim : `` How pretty she was -- that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette , the last time I saw her at Longchamps , her hair curled in sustained sentiments , with her come-and-see of turquoises , her gown of the color of persons newly arrived , and her little agitation muff ! '' 
He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin , which he was fond of talking about effusively . 
`` I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin , '' said he . 
Madame de Boufflers , having seen him by chance when he was twenty , had described him as `` a charming fool . '' 
He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power , regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois .
