`` Kiss the hand of a prisoner , '' he said , shaking his head , `` to what purpose ? '' 
`` Why did you tell me , '' said Aramis , `` that you were happy here ? 
Why , that you aspired to nothing ? 
Why , in a word , by thus speaking , do you prevent me from being frank in my turn ? '' 
The same light shone a third time in the young man 's eyes , but died ineffectually away as before . 
`` You distrust me , '' said Aramis . 
`` And why say you so , monsieur ? '' 
`` Oh , for a very simple reason ; if you know what you ought to know , you ought to mistrust everybody . '' 
`` Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful , since you suspect me of knowing what I do not know . '' 
Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance .
