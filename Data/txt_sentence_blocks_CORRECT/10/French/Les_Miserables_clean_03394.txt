Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis . 
He got as far as the Rue Pavee , shook his head and turned back ; then he went no further than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons ; then he did not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux . 
One would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up , and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether . 
Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour , he undertook the same trip , but he no longer completed it , and , perhaps without himself being aware of the fact , he constantly shortened it . 
His whole countenance expressed this single idea : What is the use ? 
-- His eye was dim ; no more radiance . 
His tears were also exhausted ; they no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid ; that thoughtful eye was dry . 
The old man 's head was still craned forward ; his chin moved at times ; the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold . 
Sometimes , when the weather was bad , he had an umbrella under his arm , but he never opened it . 
The good women of the quarter said : `` He is an innocent . ''
