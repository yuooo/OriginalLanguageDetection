And thinking that the elder , who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation , deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite , he added , as be handed him the largest share : -- `` Ram that into your muzzle . ''

As they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls , they blocked up the shop of the baker , who , now that they had paid their money , looked angrily at them . 
`` Let 's go into the street again , '' said Gavroche . 
They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille .

`` Well , he is a very green ` un , '' said Gavroche . 
Then , becoming thoughtful , he muttered between his teeth : -- `` All the same , if I had charge of the babes I 'd lock 'em up better than that . ''
