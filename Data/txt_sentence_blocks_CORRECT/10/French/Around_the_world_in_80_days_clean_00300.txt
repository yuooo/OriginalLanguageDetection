This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail . 
Behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . 
It was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . 
During the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . 
Provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains . 
Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft . 
The wind was favourable , being fresh , and blowing from the west . 
The snow had hardened , and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha . 
Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York . 
It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered ; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected .
