No one loves the light like the blind man . 
The dwarf adores the drum-major . 
The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven . 
Why ? 
In order to watch the bird in its flight . 
Grantaire , in whom writhed doubt , loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras . 
He had need of Enjolras . 
That chaste , healthy , firm , upright , hard , candid nature charmed him , without his being clearly aware of it , and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him . 
He admired his opposite by instinct . 
His soft , yielding , dislocated , sickly , shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column .
