That stopped me , it seemed to me that I was born again . '' 
`` You are full of strength and life , '' cried Marius . 
`` Do you imagine that a person can die like this ? 
You have had sorrow , you shall have no more . 
It is I who ask your forgiveness , and on my knees ! 
You are going to live , and to live with us , and to live a long time . 
We take possession of you once more . 
There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness . '' 
`` You see , '' resumed Cosette , all bathed in tears , `` that Marius says that you shall not die . '' 
Jean Valjean continued to smile .
