`` Mr. Marius , are you there ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Mr. Marius , '' went on the voice , `` your friends are waiting for you at the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie . '' 
This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him .

M. MABEUF Jean Valjean 's purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf .

He had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche .
