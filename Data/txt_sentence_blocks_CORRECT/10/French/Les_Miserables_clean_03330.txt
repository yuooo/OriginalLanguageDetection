`` You shall come every evening , '' said Marius , `` and Cosette will be waiting for you . '' 
`` You are kind , sir , '' said Jean Valjean . 
Marius saluted Jean Valjean , happiness escorted despair to the door , and these two men parted . 
THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN Marius was quite upset . 
The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen Cosette , was now explained to him . 
There was something enigmatic about that person , of which his instinct had warned him . 
This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces , the galleys . 
This M. Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean . 
To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one 's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves . 
Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood ?
