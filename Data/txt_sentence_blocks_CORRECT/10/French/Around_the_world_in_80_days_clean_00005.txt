On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster , because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six ; and he was awaiting his successor , who was due at the house between eleven and half-past . 
Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years . 
At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit Saville Row , and repair to the Reform . 
A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated , and James Forster , the dismissed servant , appeared . 
`` The new servant , '' said he . 
A young man of thirty advanced and bowed . 
`` You are a Frenchman , I believe , '' asked Phileas Fogg , `` and your name is John ? '' 
`` Jean , if monsieur pleases , '' replied the newcomer , `` Jean Passepartout , a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another . 
I believe I 'm honest , monsieur , but , to be outspoken , I 've had several trades . 
I 've been an itinerant singer , a circus-rider , when I used to vault like Leotard , and dance on a rope like Blondin .
