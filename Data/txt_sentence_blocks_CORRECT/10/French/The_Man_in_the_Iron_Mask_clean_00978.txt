The hero fell without a groan - he fell while answering Aramis with words of encouragement and hope , for , thanks to the powerful arch of his hands , for an instant he believed that , like Enceladus , he would succeed in shaking off the triple load . 
But by degrees Aramis beheld the block sink ; the hands , strung for an instant , the arms stiffened for a last effort , gave way , the extended shoulders sank , wounded and torn , and the rocks continued to gradually collapse . 
`` Porthos ! 
Porthos ! '' 
cried Aramis , tearing his hair . 
`` Porthos ! 
where are you ? 
Speak ! '' 
`` Here , here , '' murmured Porthos , with a voice growing evidently weaker , `` patience ! 
patience ! ''
