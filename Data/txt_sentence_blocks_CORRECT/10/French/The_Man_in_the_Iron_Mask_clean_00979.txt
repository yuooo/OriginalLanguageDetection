Scarcely had he pronounced these words , when the impulse of the fall augmented the weight ; the enormous rock sank down , pressed by those others which sank in from the sides , and , as it were , swallowed up Porthos in a sepulcher of badly jointed stones . 
On hearing the dying voice of his friend , Aramis had sprung to land . 
Two of the Bretons followed him , with each a lever in his hand - one being sufficient to take care of the bark . 
The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided them amidst the ruins . 
Aramis , animated , active and young as at twenty , sprang towards the triple mass , and with his hands , delicate as those of a woman , raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great granite grave . 
Then he caught a glimpse , through the darkness of that charnel-house , of the still brilliant eye of his friend , to whom the momentary lifting of the mass restored a momentary respiration . 
The two men came rushing up , grasped their iron levers , united their triple strength , not merely to raise it , but sustain it . 
All was useless . 
They gave way with cries of grief , and the rough voice of Porthos , seeing them exhaust themselves in a useless struggle , murmured in an almost cheerful tone those supreme words which came to his lips with the last respiration , `` Too heavy ! '' 
After which his eyes darkened and closed , his face grew ashy pale , the hands whitened , and the colossus sank quite down , breathing his last sigh .
