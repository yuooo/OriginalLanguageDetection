Those who had seen Jean Valjean at the epoch when he passed through D -- in October , 1815 , could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit . 
He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks , in order to remind himself continually of his starting-point , but he had concealed all that came from the galleys , and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen . 
He cast a furtive glance towards the door , as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it ; then , with a quick and abrupt movement , he took the whole in his arms at once , without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years , and flung them all , rags , cudgel , knapsack , into the fire . 
He closed the false cupboard again , and with redoubled precautions , henceforth unnecessary , since it was now empty , he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture , which he pushed in front of it . 
After the lapse of a few seconds , the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce , red , tremulous glow . 
Everything was on fire ; the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber . 
As the knapsack was consumed , together with the hideous rags which it contained , it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes . 
By bending over , one could have readily recognized a coin , -- no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard . 
He did not look at the fire , but paced back and forth with the same step . 
All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks , which shone vaguely on the chimney-piece , through the glow .
