`` We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop . '' 
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once . 
There 's the bell ringing now . '' 
The train started . 
`` I 'm really very sorry , gentlemen , '' said the conductor . 
`` Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you . 
But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ? 
`` That would n't be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , '' said the colonel , in a jeering tone .
