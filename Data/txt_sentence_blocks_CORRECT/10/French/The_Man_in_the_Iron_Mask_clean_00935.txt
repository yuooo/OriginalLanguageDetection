`` No , '' replied Biscarrat . 
`` Only , as it looks as dark as a wolf 's mouth , we might break our necks in it . '' 
`` Witness the dogs , '' said a guard , `` who seem to have broken theirs . '' 
`` What the devil can have become of them ? '' 
asked the young men in chorus . 
And every master called his dog by his name , whistled to him in his favorite mode , without a single one replying to either call or whistle . 
`` It is perhaps an enchanted grotto , '' said Biscarrat ; `` let us see . '' 
And , jumping from his horse , he made a step into the grotto . 
`` Stop ! 
stop !
