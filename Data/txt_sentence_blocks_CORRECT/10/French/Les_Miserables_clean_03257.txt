The old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers ; the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid Marius down . 
Basque , in a black coat , knee-breeches , white stockings and white gloves , was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served . 
Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling , charged Basque to explain his absence , and went away . 
The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street . 
Jean Valjean stood for several minutes , erect and motionless in the darkness , beneath those radiant windows . 
He listened . 
The confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear . 
He heard the loud , commanding tones of the grandfather , the violins , the clatter of the plates , the bursts of laughter , and through all that merry uproar , he distinguished Cosette 's sweet and joyous voice . 
He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire , and returned to the Rue de l'Homme Arme . 
In order to return thither , he took the Rue Saint-Louis , the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine , and the Blancs-Manteaux ; it was a little longer , but it was the road through which , for the last three months , he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de l'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire , in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple .
