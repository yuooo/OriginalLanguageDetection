The streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd . 
Each time a company passed , Passepartout chuckled , and said to himself : `` Good ! 
another Japanese embassy departing for Europe ! '' 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT 'S NOSE BECOMES OUTRAGEOUSLY LONG The next morning poor , jaded , famished Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards , and the sooner he did so the better . 
He might , indeed , sell his watch ; but he would have starved first . 
Now or never he must use the strong , if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him . 
He knew several French and English songs , and resolved to try them upon the Japanese , who must be lovers of music , since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals , tam-tams , and tambourines , and could not but appreciate European talent . 
It was , perhaps , rather early in the morning to get up a concert , and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers , might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado 's features . 
Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours ; and , as he was sauntering along , it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist . 
The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project ; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger .
