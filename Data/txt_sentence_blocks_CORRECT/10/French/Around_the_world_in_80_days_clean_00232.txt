Boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . 
One of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand . 
`` It would be prudent for us to retire , '' said Fix , who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to London . 
`` If there is any question about England in all this , and we were recognised , I fear it would go hard with us . '' 
`` An English subject -- '' began Mr. Fogg . 
He did not finish his sentence ; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood , and there were frantic shouts of , `` Hurrah for Mandiboy ! 
Hip , hip , hurrah ! '' 
It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the Camerfield forces in flank . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix found themselves between two fires ; it was too late to escape . 
The torrent of men , armed with loaded canes and sticks , was irresistible .
