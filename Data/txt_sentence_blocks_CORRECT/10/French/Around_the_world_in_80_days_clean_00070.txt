At five minutes before eight , Passepartout , hatless , shoeless , and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes , rushed breathlessly into the station . 
Fix , who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay , was there , upon the platform . 
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta , and farther , if necessary . 
Passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg . 
`` I hope that this will not happen again , '' said Phileas Fogg coldly , as he got into the train . 
Poor Passepartout , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word . 
Fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan . 
`` No , I 'll stay , '' muttered he . 
`` An offence has been committed on Indian soil . 
I 've got my man . ''
