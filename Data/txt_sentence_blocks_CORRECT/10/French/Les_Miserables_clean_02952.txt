Without cartridges , without sword , he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering . 
He had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself ; he had retreated into the corner of the room , and there , with haughty eye , and head borne high , with this stump of a weapon in his hand , he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him . 
A cry arose : `` He is the leader ! 
It was he who slew the artillery-man . 
It is well that he has placed himself there . 
Let him remain there . 
Let us shoot him down on the spot . '' 
`` Shoot me , '' said Enjolras . 
And flinging away his bit of gun-barrel , and folding his arms , he offered his breast . 
The audacity of a fine death always affects men .
