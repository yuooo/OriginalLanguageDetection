He remained the same , setting aside his fits of wrath . 
He still held the same opinions . 
Only , they had been tempered . 
To speak accurately , he had no longer any opinions , he had sympathies . 
To what party did he belong ? 
To the party of humanity . 
Out of humanity he chose France ; out of the Nation he chose the people ; out of the people he chose the woman . 
It was to that point above all , that his pity was directed . 
Now he preferred an idea to a deed , a poet to a hero , and he admired a book like Job more than an event like Marengo . 
And then , when , after a day spent in meditation , he returned in the evening through the boulevards , and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond , the nameless gleams , the abyss , the shadow , the mystery , all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to him .
