Marius heard Mother Jondrette 's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark . 
The door opened . 
He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror . 
The Jondrette entered . 
The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow . 
One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which Marius was leaning , so that he disappeared within it . 
Mother Jondrette raised her eyes , did not see Marius , took the two chairs , the only ones which Marius possessed , and went away , letting the door fall heavily to behind her . 
She re-entered the lair . 
`` Here are the two chairs . '' 
`` And here is the lantern .
