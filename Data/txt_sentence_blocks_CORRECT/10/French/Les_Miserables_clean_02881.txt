In the morning everything was dripping , in the afternoon everything is powdered over . 
Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight ; it is warm freshness . 
The gardens and meadows , having water at their roots , and sun in their flowers , become perfuming-pans of incense , and smoke with all their odors at once . 
Everything smiles , sings and offers itself . 
One feels gently intoxicated . 
The springtime is a provisional paradise , the sun helps man to have patience . 
There are beings who demand nothing further ; mortals , who , having the azure of heaven , say : `` It is enough ! '' 
dreamers absorbed in the wonderful , dipping into the idolatry of nature , indifferent to good and evil , contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man , who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these , and the thirst of those , with the nudity of the poor in winter , with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column , with the pallet , the attic , the dungeon , and the rags of shivering young girls , when they can dream beneath the trees ; peaceful and terrible spirits they , and pitilessly satisfied . 
Strange to say , the infinite suffices them . 
That great need of man , the finite , which admits of embrace , they ignore .
