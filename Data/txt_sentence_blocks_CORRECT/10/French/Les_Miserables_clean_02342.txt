The words of the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled , as it were , beneath the hot iron of the executioner . 
Some seem to be still smoking . 
Such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the fleur-de-lys , which has suddenly been laid bare . 
Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are fugitives from justice . 
Metaphor is sometimes so shameless , that one feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter . 
Moreover , in spite of all this , and because of all this , this strange dialect has by rights , its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal , and which is called literature . 
Slang , whether the public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry . 
It is a language . 
Yes , by the deformity of certain terms , we recognize the fact that it was chewed by Mandrin , and by the splendor of certain metonymies , we feel that Villon spoke it . 
That exquisite and celebrated verse -- Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan ?
