Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately . 
Mr. Fogg still held Aouda 's hand in his own ; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith . 
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson , of Marylebone parish , that evening . 
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile , and said , `` Never too late . '' 
It was five minutes past eight . 
`` Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ? '' 
`` For to-morrow , Monday , '' said Mr. Fogg , turning to Aouda . 
`` Yes ; for to-morrow , Monday , '' she replied . 
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him .
