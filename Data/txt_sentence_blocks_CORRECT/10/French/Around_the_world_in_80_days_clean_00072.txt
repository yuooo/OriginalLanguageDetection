The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that , of all the eccentric persons he had ever met , none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences . 
Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . 
In the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else . 
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the Island of Salcette , and had got into the open country . 
At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah ; and , passing Pauwell , they entered the defiles of the mountains , with their basalt bases , and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time , and now Sir Francis , reviving the conversation , observed , `` Some years ago , Mr. Fogg , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager . '' 
`` How so , Sir Francis ? '' 
`` Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah , on the other side . '' 
`` Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . ''
