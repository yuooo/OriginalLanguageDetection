`` That is , never to come back again , '' D'Artagnan suffered to escape him . 
`` Till we meet again , then , dear Athos - and if you are diligent , I shall embrace you the sooner . '' 
So saying , he put his foot in the stirrup , which Raoul held . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said the young man , embracing him . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , as he got into his saddle . 
His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends . 
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos , near the gates of Antibes , whither D'Artagnan , after his supper , had ordered his horses to be brought . 
The road began to branch off there , white and undulating in the vapors of the night .
