`` Listen to me , '' said the king ; `` if your friends compromise you , it is not Monsieur 's fault . '' 
He spoke these words with so much kindness that Madame , encouraged , having borne so many solitary griefs so long , was nearly bursting into tears , so full was her heart . 
`` Come , come , dear little sister , '' said the king , `` tell me your griefs ; on the word of a brother , I pity them ; on the word of a king , I will put an end to them . '' 
She raised her glorious eyes and , in a melancholy tone : `` It is not my friends who compromise me , '' said she ; `` they are either absent or concealed ; they have been brought into disgrace with your majesty ; they , so devoted , so good , so loyal ! '' 
`` You say this on account of De Guiche , whom I have exiled , at Monsieur 's desire ? '' 
`` And who , since that unjust exile , has endeavored to get himself killed once every day . '' 
`` Unjust , say you , sister ? '' 
`` So unjust , that if I had not had the respect mixed with friendship that I have always entertained for your majesty - '' `` Well ! '' 
`` Well !
