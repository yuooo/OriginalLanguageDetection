His pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields . 
He always took his meals alone , with an open book before him , which he read . 
He had a well-selected little library . 
He loved books ; books are cold but safe friends . 
In proportion as leisure came to him with fortune , he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind . 
It had been observed that , ever since his arrival at M. sur M. . 
his language had grown more polished , more choice , and more gentle with every passing year . 
He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls , but he rarely made use of it . 
When he did happen to do so , his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror . 
He never killed an inoffensive animal .
