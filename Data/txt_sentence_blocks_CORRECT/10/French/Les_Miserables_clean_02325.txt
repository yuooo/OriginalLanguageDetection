`` Yes , yes , '' said Brujon , `` it must be looked up . '' 
In the meanwhile , none of the men seemed to see Gavroche , who , during this colloquy , had seated himself on one of the fence-posts ; he waited a few moments , thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him , then he put on his shoes again , and said : -- `` Is that all ? 
You do n't want any more , my men ? 
Now you 're out of your scrape . 
I 'm off . 
I must go and get my brats out of bed . '' 
And off he went . 
The five men emerged , one after another , from the enclosure . 
When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets , Babet took Thenardier aside . 
`` Did you take a good look at that young ` un ? ''
