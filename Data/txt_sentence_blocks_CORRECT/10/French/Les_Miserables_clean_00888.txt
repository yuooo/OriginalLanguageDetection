Cosette was her only servant ; a mouse in the service of an elephant . 
Everything trembled at the sound of her voice , -- window panes , furniture , and people . 
Her big face , dotted with red blotches , presented the appearance of a skimmer . 
She had a beard . 
She was an ideal market-porter dressed in woman 's clothes . 
She swore splendidly ; she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist . 
Except for the romances which she had read , and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times , in a very queer way , the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her , `` That is a woman . '' 
This Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife . 
When one heard her speak , one said , `` That is a gendarme '' ; when one saw her drink , one said , `` That is a carter '' ; when one saw her handle Cosette , one said , `` That is the hangman . '' 
One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose .
