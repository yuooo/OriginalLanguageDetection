`` No , monsieur , such a ride is worth no more than a crown ; that is what M. Grimaud , the comte 's intendant , always pays me when he makes use of that carriage ; and I should not wish the Comte de la Fere to have to reproach me with having imposed on one of his friends . '' 
`` As you please , '' said Aramis , `` particularly as regards disobliging the Comte de la Fere ; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for your idea . '' 
`` Oh ! 
doubtless , '' replied the postmaster with delight . 
And he himself harnessed the ancient horse to the creaking carriage . 
In the meantime Porthos was curious to behold . 
He imagined he had discovered a clew to the secret , and he felt pleased , because a visit to Athos , in the first place , promised him much satisfaction , and , in the next , gave him the hope of finding at the same time a good bed and good supper . 
The master , having got the carriage ready , ordered one of his men to drive the strangers to La Fere . 
Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis , whispering in his ear , `` I understand . '' 
`` Aha ! ''
