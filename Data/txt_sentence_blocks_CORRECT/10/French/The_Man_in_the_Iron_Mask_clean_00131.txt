` That will not be humiliating to you ? ' '' 
` My friend , ' said I , ` there is , I think , a great difference between being supported and being measured . ' '' 
`` The distinction is full of the soundest sense , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Then , '' continued Porthos , `` he made a sign : two lads approached ; one supported my left arm , while the other , with infinite address , supported my right . '' '' 
` Another , my man , ' cried he . 
A third approached . 
` Support monsieur by the waist , ' said he .
