`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup .
