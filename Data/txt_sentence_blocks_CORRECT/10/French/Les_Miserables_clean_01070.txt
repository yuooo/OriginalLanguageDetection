The roads were not much paved ; the streets were not much built up . 
With the exception of the two or three streets , of which we shall presently speak , all was wall and solitude there . 
Not a shop , not a vehicle , hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows ; all lights extinguished after ten o'clock . 
Gardens , convents , timber-yards , marshes ; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses . 
Such was this quarter in the last century . 
The Revolution snubbed it soundly . 
The republican government demolished and cut through it . 
Rubbish shoots were established there . 
Thirty years ago , this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings . 
To-day , it has been utterly blotted out .
