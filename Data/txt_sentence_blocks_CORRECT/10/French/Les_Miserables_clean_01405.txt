The words which he uttered the most frequently were : the sensible man , and nature . 
He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it , but he made it enter , after his own fashion , into his little chimney-corner satires : `` Nature , '' he said , `` in order that civilization may have a little of everything , gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism . 
Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale . 
The cat is a drawing-room tiger , the lizard is a pocket crocodile . 
The dancers at the opera are pink female savages . 
They do not eat men , they crunch them ; or , magicians that they are , they transform them into oysters and swallow them . 
The Caribbeans leave only the bones , they leave only the shell . 
Such are our morals . 
We do not devour , we gnaw ; we do not exterminate , we claw . ''
