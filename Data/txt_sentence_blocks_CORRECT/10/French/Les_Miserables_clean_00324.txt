There he goes with his shouting . 
But , my dear , you are splitting my head ! ' 
So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets , to black holes , as high as he can mount , and there he sets to singing , declaiming , how do I know what ? 
so that he can be heard down stairs ! 
He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney 's by penning quibbles . 
He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas . 
Ah ! 
he is very nice . 
He idolizes me so , that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes , he said to me : ` Mamselle , make your gloves into fritters , and I will eat them . ' 
It is only artists who can say such things as that .
