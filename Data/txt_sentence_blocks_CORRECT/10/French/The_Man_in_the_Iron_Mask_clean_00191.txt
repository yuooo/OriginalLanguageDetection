I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of ink . '' 
`` No , there is no ink ; no , there is no blot . '' 
`` Oh ! 
but there was , though ; I know it , because I rubbed my finger - this very one - in the powder that was over the blot . '' 
`` In a word , be it how it may , dear M. Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , `` and whatever you may have seen , the order is signed to release Marchiali , blot or no blot . '' 
`` The order is signed to release Marchiali , '' replied Baisemeaux , mechanically , endeavoring to regain his courage . 
`` And you are going to release this prisoner . 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also , I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in the world . '' 
Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile , the irony of which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux 's confusion of mind , and restored his courage . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he said , `` this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a priest confessor of our order came to visit in so imperious and so secret a manner . ''
