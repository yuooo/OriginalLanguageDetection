The latter lifted up his soldier , and quietly , with soothing words , carried him into the trench , amidst the enthusiastic applause of the regiments . 
From that time it was no longer a question of valor - the army was delirious ; two companies stole away to the advanced posts , which they instantly destroyed . 
When their comrades , restrained with great difficulty by D'Artagnan , saw them lodged upon the bastions , they rushed forward likewise ; and soon a furious assault was made upon the counterscarp , upon which depended the safety of the place . 
D'Artagnan perceived there was only one means left of checking his army - to take the place . 
He directed all his force to the two breaches , where the besieged were busy in repairing . 
The shock was terrible ; eighteen companies took part in it , and D'Artagnan went with the rest , within half cannon-shot of the place , to support the attack by echelons . 
The cries of the Dutch , who were being poniarded upon their guns by D'Artagnan 's grenadiers , were distinctly audible . 
The struggle grew fiercer with the despair of the governor , who disputed his position foot by foot . 
D'Artagnan , to put an end to the affair , and to silence the fire , which was unceasing , sent a fresh column , which penetrated like a very wedge ; and he soon perceived upon the ramparts , through the fire , the terrified flight of the besieged , pursued by the besiegers . 
At this moment the general , breathing feely and full of joy , heard a voice behind him , saying , `` Monsieur , if you please , from M. Colbert . ''
