in the name of your father ! ' 
`` At these words M. de Bragelonne turned round ; his countenance expressed a lively grief , but he did not stop ; we then concluded that his horse must have run away with him . 
When M. le duc saw cause to conclude that the vicomte was no longer master of his horse , and had watched him precede the first grenadiers , his highness cried , ` Musketeers , kill his horse ! 
A hundred pistoles for the man who kills his horse ! ' 
But who could expect to hit the beast without at least wounding his rider ? 
No one dared the attempt . 
At length one presented himself ; he was a sharp - shooter of the regiment of Picardy , named Luzerne , who took aim at the animal , fired , and hit him in the quarters , for we saw the blood redden the hair of the horse . 
Instead of falling , the cursed jennet was irritated , and carried him on more furiously than ever . 
Every Picard who saw this unfortunate young man rushing on to meet certain death , shouted in the loudest manner , ` Throw yourself off , monsieur le vicomte ! 
- off !
