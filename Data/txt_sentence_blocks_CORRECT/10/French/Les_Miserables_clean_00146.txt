`` I can not receive you , sir , '' said he . 
The man half rose . 
`` What ! 
Are you afraid that I will not pay you ? 
Do you want me to pay you in advance ? 
I have money , I tell you . '' 
`` It is not that . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` You have money -- '' `` Yes , '' said the man . 
`` And I , '' said the host , `` have no room . ''
