As soon as they reached Baisemeaux 's quarters , `` Let us proceed to business , my dear governor , '' said Aramis . 
`` Alas ! '' 
replied Baisemeaux . 
`` You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres , '' said the bishop . 
`` And to pay over the first third of the sum , '' added the poor governor , with a sigh , taking three steps towards his iron strong-box . 
`` Here is the receipt , '' said Aramis . 
`` And here is the money , '' returned Baisemeaux , with a threefold sigh . 
`` The order instructed me only to give a receipt ; it said nothing about receiving the money , '' rejoined Aramis . 
`` Adieu , monsieur le governeur ! '' 
And he departed , leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile .
