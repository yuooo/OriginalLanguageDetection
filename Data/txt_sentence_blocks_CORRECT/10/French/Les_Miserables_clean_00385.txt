Children at that age are only copies of their mother . 
The size is smaller ; that is all . 
A year passed ; then another . 
People in the village said : -- `` Those Thenardiers are good people . 
They are not rich , and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands ! '' 
They thought that Cosette 's mother had forgotten her . 
In the meanwhile , Thenardier , having learned , it is impossible to say by what obscure means , that the child was probably a bastard , and that the mother could not acknowledge it , exacted fifteen francs a month , saying that `` the creature '' was growing and `` eating , '' and threatening to send her away . 
`` Let her not bother me , '' he exclaimed , `` or I 'll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets . 
I must have an increase . '' 
The mother paid the fifteen francs .
