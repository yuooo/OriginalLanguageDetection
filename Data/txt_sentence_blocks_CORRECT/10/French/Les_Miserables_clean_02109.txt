And then , she loved her father , that is to say , Jean Valjean , with all her soul , with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her . 
It will be remembered that M. Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal . 
Jean Valjean had continued this practice ; he had come to converse well ; he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself . 
He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness ; his mind was rough and his heart was soft . 
During their conversations in the Luxembourg , he gave her explanations of everything , drawing on what he had read , and also on what he had suffered . 
As she listened to him , Cosette 's eyes wandered vaguely about . 
This simple man sufficed for Cosette 's thought , the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes . 
When she had had a good chase after the butterflies , she came panting up to him and said : `` Ah ! 
How I have run ! '' 
He kissed her brow .
