It seemed evident that certain Spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too easily ; the idea of corruption was connected with the victory ; it appears as though generals and not battles had been won , and the conquering soldier returned humiliated . 
A debasing war , in short , in which the Bank of France could be read in the folds of the flag . 
Soldiers of the war of 1808 , on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin , frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels , and began to regret Palafox . 
It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchine rather than Ballesteros in front of her . 
From a still more serious point of view , and one which it is also proper to insist upon here , this war , which wounded the military spirit of France , enraged the democratic spirit . 
It was an enterprise of inthralment . 
In that campaign , the object of the French soldier , the son of democracy , was the conquest of a yoke for others . 
A hideous contradiction . 
France is made to arouse the soul of nations , not to stifle it . 
All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French Revolution : liberty darts rays from France .
