She gazed at them , she admired them , in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song , she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read : -- `` You have two pretty children , Madame . '' 
The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young . 
The mother raised her head and thanked her , and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door , she herself being seated on the threshold . 
The two women began to chat . 
`` My name is Madame Thenardier , '' said the mother of the two little girls . 
`` We keep this inn . '' 
Then , her mind still running on her romance , she resumed humming between her teeth : -- `` It must be so ; I am a knight , And I am off to Palestine . '' 
This Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman , thin and angular -- the type of the soldier 's wife in all its unpleasantness ; and what was odd , with a languishing air , which she owed to her perusal of romances . 
She was a simpering , but masculine creature . 
Old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman .
