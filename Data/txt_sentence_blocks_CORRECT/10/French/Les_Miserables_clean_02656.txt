He found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops , he shunned the patrols , he avoided the sentinels . 
He made a circuit , reached the Rue de Bethisy , and directed his course towards the Halles . 
At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais , there were no longer any lanterns . 
After having passed the zone of the crowd , he had passed the limits of the troops ; he found himself in something startling . 
There was no longer a passer-by , no longer a soldier , no longer a light , there was no one ; solitude , silence , night , I know not what chill which seized hold upon one . 
Entering a street was like entering a cellar . 
He continued to advance . 
He took a few steps . 
Some one passed close to him at a run . 
Was it a man ?
