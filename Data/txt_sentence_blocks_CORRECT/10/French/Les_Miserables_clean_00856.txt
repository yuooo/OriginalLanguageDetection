`` I have been robbed , '' said the officer ; `` I am sorry for that . 
You should have had them . '' 
The steps of the patrol became more and more distinct . 
`` Some one is coming , '' said the prowler , with the movement of a man who is taking his departure . 
The officer raised his arm feebly , and detained him . 
`` You have saved my life . 
Who are you ? '' 
The prowler answered rapidly , and in a low voice : -- `` Like yourself , I belonged to the French army . 
I must leave you . 
If they were to catch me , they would shoot me .
