`` M. de Roncherolles , who was sent with your majesty 's musketeers , has remitted me some papers , '' replied Colbert . 
`` I will look at them . 
Give me your hand . '' 
`` My hand , sire ! '' 
`` Yes , that I may place it in that of M. d'Artagnan . 
In fact , M. d'Artagnan , '' added he , with a smile , turning towards the soldier , who , at sight of the clerk , had resumed his haughty attitude , `` you do not know this man ; make his acquaintance . '' 
And he pointed to Colbert . 
`` He has been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions , but he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
stammered Colbert , confused with pleasure and fear .
