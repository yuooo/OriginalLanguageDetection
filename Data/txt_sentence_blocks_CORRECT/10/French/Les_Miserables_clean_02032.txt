`` What is that ? '' 
asked Courfeyrac . 
`` The Barriere du Maine , '' replied Enjolras . 
Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection , then he resumed : -- `` At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers , painters , and journeymen in the studios of sculptors . 
They are an enthusiastic family , but liable to cool off . 
I do n't know what has been the matter with them for some time past . 
They are thinking of something else . 
They are becoming extinguished . 
They pass their time playing dominoes . 
There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little , but with firmness .
