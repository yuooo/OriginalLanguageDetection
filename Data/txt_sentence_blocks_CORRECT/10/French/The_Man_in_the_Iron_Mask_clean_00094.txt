`` Well , my dear Monsieur Moliere , but you will go and tell him I am here . ''

`` If you do n't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here , my dear Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan , in a low tone , `` I warn you of one thing : that I wo n't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me . '' 
Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture , `` This gentleman , is it not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds and hearts of men .
