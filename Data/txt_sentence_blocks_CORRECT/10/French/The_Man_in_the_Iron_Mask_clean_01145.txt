`` D'Imfreville ? ''

`` He is a man I have discovered ; he has a specialty ; he is a man of genius - he knows how to set men to work .

`` Calculating upon the character of the Dutch , our allies , I said to myself , ` They are merchants , they are friendly with the king ; they will be happy to sell to the king what they fabricate for themselves ; then the more we buy ' - Ah ! 
I must add this : I have Forant - do you know Forant , D'Artagnan ? ''
