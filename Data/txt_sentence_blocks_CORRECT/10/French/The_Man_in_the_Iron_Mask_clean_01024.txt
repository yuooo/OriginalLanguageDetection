`` Very well , they will be dead , then , Monsieur d'Artagnan , and that will come to the same thing , since I should only take them to have them hanged . '' 
D'Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow . 
`` I have told you , '' pursued Louis XIV. , `` that I would one day be an affectionate , generous , and constant master . 
You are now the only man of former times worthy of my anger or my friendship . 
I will not spare you either sentiment , according to your conduct .

Could I , tell me , do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate ?
