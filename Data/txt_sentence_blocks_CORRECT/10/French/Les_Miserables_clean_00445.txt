She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head , and in which she was still pretty . 
Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine 's heart . 
When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair , she began to hate every one about her . 
She had long shared the universal veneration for Father Madeleine ; yet , by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her , that he was the cause of her unhappiness , she came to hate him also , and most of all . 
When she passed the factory in working hours , when the workpeople were at the door , she affected to laugh and sing . 
An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said , `` There 's a girl who will come to a bad end . 
She took a lover , the first who offered , a man whom she did not love , out of bravado and with rage in her heart . 
He was a miserable scamp , a sort of mendicant musician , a lazy beggar , who beat her , and who abandoned her as she had taken him , in disgust . 
She adored her child . 
The lower she descended , the darker everything grew about her , the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart .
