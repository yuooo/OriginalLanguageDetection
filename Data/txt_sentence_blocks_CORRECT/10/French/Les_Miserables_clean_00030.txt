A tragic event occurred at D -- A man was condemned to death for murder . 
He was a wretched fellow , not exactly educated , not exactly ignorant , who had been a mountebank at fairs , and a writer for the public . 
The town took a great interest in the trial . 
On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man , the chaplain of the prison fell ill . 
A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments . 
They sent for the cure . 
It seems that he refused to come , saying , `` That is no affair of mine . 
I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task , and with that mountebank : I , too , am ill ; and besides , it is not my place . '' 
This reply was reported to the Bishop , who said , `` Monsieur le Cure is right : it is not his place ; it is mine . '' 
He went instantly to the prison , descended to the cell of the `` mountebank , '' called him by name , took him by the hand , and spoke to him .
