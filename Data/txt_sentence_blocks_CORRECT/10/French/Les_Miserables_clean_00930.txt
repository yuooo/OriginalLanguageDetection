The man said nothing for a moment ; then he remarked abruptly : -- `` So you have no mother . '' 
`` I do n't know , '' answered the child . 
Before the man had time to speak again , she added : -- `` I do n't think so . 
Other people have mothers . 
I have none . '' 
And after a silence she went on : -- `` I think that I never had any . '' 
The man halted ; he set the bucket on the ground , bent down and placed both hands on the child 's shoulders , making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark . 
Cosette 's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
said the man .
