`` You are pursued ! 
- a conspiracy ! 
Eh ! 
my friend , what do you tell me ? '' 
`` The saddest truth . 
I am entirely ruined . '' 
`` Well , but Porthos - this title of duke - what does all that mean ? '' 
`` That is the subject of my severest pain ; that is the deepest of my wounds . 
I have , believing in infallible success , drawn Porthos into my conspiracy . 
He threw himself into it , as you know he would do , with all his strength , without knowing what he was about ; and now he is as much compromised as myself - as completely ruined as I am . ''
