Yves waved a white cloth at the end of a gaff . 
This was like striking their flag . 
The pursuer came on like a race-horse . 
It launched a fresh Greek fire , which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe , and threw a light upon them as white as sunshine . 
`` At the first sign of resistance , '' cried the commander of the balancelle , `` fire ! '' 
The soldiers brought their muskets to the present . 
`` Did we not say we surrendered ? '' 
said Yves . 
`` Alive , alive , captain ! '' 
cried one excited soldier , `` they must be taken alive . ''
