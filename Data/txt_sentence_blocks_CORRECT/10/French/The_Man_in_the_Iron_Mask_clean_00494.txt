`` Sire , '' said Henrietta , `` I , on my part , have always liked M. Fouquet . 
He is a man of good taste , - a superior man . '' 
`` A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly , '' added Monsieur ; `` and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him . '' 
`` Every one in this thinks too much of himself , and nobody for the state , '' said the old queen . 
`` M. Fouquet , it is a fact , M. Fouquet is ruining the state . '' 
`` Well , mother ! '' 
replied Philippe , in rather a lower key , `` do you likewise constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert ? '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
replied the old queen , rather surprised . 
`` Why , in truth , '' replied Philippe , `` you speak that just as your old friend Madame de Chevreuse would speak . ''
