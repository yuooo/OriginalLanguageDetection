`` Oh , monsieur ! '' 
`` Your movement , monseigneur , arises from an excellent disposition . 
I thank you .

I am convinced that , when arrived at the summit , you will judge me still more worthy to be your friend ; and then , monseigneur , we two will do such great deeds , that ages hereafter shall long speak of them . ''

But the doctors always prefer the king who is to the king who is not .
