Every tree in the neighborhood which presented a fair appearance of beauty or stature had been taken up by its roots and transplanted to the park . 
Fouquet could well afford to purchase trees to ornament his park , since he had bought up three villages and their appurtenances -LRB- to use a legal word -RRB- to increase its extent . 
M. de Scudery said of this palace , that , for the purpose of keeping the grounds and gardens well watered , M. Fouquet had divided a river into a thousand fountains , and gathered the waters of a thousand fountains into torrents . 
This same Monsieur de Scudery said a great many other things in his `` Clelie , '' about this palace of Valterre , the charms of which he describes most minutely . 
We should be far wiser to send our curious readers to Vaux to judge for themselves , than to refer them to `` Clelie ; '' and yet there are as many leagues from Paris to Vaux , as there are volumes of the `` Clelie . '' 
This magnificent palace had been got ready for the reception of the greatest reigning sovereign of the time . 
M. Fouquet 's friends had transported thither , some their actors and their dresses , others their troops of sculptors and artists ; not forgetting others with their ready - mended pens , - floods of impromptus were contemplated . 
The cascades , somewhat rebellious nymphs though they were , poured forth their waters brighter and clearer than crystal : they scattered over the bronze triton and nereids their waves of foam , which glistened like fire in the rays of the sun . 
An army of servants were hurrying to and fro in squadrons in the courtyard and corridors ; while Fouquet , who had only that morning arrived , walked all through the palace with a calm , observant glance , in order to give his last orders , after his intendants had inspected everything . 
It was , as we have said , the 15th of August .
