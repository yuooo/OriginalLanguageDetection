`` This bishop 's prose shocks me ; I want to eat eggs without being permitted . 
Your style is the hot and cold ; I am amusing myself . 
Besides , I 'm not wasting myself , I 'm getting a start ; and if I tore down that charge , Hercle ! 
't was only to whet my appetite . '' 
This word , Hercle , struck Gavroche . 
He sought all occasions for learning , and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem . 
He inquired of him : -- `` What does Hercle mean ? '' 
Bahorel answered : -- `` It means cursed name of a dog , in Latin . '' 
Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed , probably a Friend of the A B C . 
He shouted to him : -- `` Quick , cartridges , para bellum . ''
