He was an officiating priest and a man of war ; from the immediate point of view , a soldier of the democracy ; above the contemporary movement , the priest of the ideal . 
His eyes were deep , his lids a little red , his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful , his brow was lofty . 
A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view . 
Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last , who became illustrious at an early age , he was endowed with excessive youth , and was as rosy as a young girl , although subject to hours of pallor . 
Already a man , he still seemed a child . 
His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen ; he was serious , it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman . 
He had but one passion -- the right ; but one thought -- to overthrow the obstacle . 
On Mount Aventine , he would have been Gracchus ; in the Convention , he would have been Saint-Just . 
He hardly saw the roses , he ignored spring , he did not hear the carolling of the birds ; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton ; he , like Harmodius , thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword . 
He was severe in his enjoyments .
