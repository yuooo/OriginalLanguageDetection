`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . ''
