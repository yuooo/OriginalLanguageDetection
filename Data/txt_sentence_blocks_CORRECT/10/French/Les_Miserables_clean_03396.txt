He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him , as much as possible , from Cosette 's mind . 
He had , in a manner , always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean , sure that , in this way , she would not perceive nor think of the latter . 
It was more than effacement , it was an eclipse . 
Marius did what he considered necessary and just . 
He thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen , and others which will be seen later on , for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness , but without weakness . 
Chance having ordained that he should encounter , in a case which he had argued , a former employee of the Laffitte establishment , he had acquired mysterious information , without seeking it , which he had not been able , it is true , to probe , out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard , and out of consideration for Jean Valjean 's perilous position . 
He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform : the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion . 
In the meanwhile , he abstained from touching that money . 
As for Cosette , she had not been initiated into any of these secrets ; but it would be harsh to condemn her also . 
There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism , which caused her to do , instinctively and almost mechanically , what Marius wished .
