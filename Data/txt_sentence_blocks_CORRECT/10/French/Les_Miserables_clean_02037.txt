Do you take me for a brute ? 
I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer . 
The Rights of Man , the sovereignty of the people , sapristi ! 
I am even a bit of a Hebertist . 
I can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock , watch in hand . '' 
`` Be serious , '' said Enjolras . 
`` I am wild , '' replied Grantaire . 
Enjolras meditated for a few moments , and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution . 
`` Grantaire , '' he said gravely , `` I consent to try you . 
You shall go to the Barriere du Maine . ''
