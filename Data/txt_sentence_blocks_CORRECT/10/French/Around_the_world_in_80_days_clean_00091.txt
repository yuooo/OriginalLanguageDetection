Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form . 
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin . 
It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince . 
Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments ; these closed the procession . 
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , `` A suttee . '' 
The Parsee nodded , and put his finger to his lips . 
The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood . 
The songs gradually died away ; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again . 
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked : `` What is a suttee ? '' 
`` A suttee , '' returned the general , `` is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one .
