The street-lantern , situated directly opposite , cast some light on the stairs , and thus effected some economy in illumination . 
Jean Valjean , either for the sake of getting the air , or mechanically , thrust his head out of this window .

Jean Valjean was overwhelmed with amazement ; there was no longer any one there . 
Javert had taken his departure .

The doctor who had been sent for had hastened thither . 
Aunt Gillenormand had risen .
