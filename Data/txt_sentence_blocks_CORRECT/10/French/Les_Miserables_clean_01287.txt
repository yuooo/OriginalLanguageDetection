Jean Valjean went on : -- `` The problem is to get out of here without being seen . 
This offers the means . 
But give me some information , in the first place . 
How is it managed ? 
Where is this coffin ? '' 
`` The empty one ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Down stairs , in what is called the dead-room . 
It stands on two trestles , under the pall . '' 
`` How long is the coffin ? ''
