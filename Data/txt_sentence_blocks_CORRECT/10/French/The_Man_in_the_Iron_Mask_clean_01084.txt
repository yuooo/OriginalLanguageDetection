: The Bulletin . 
The Duc de Beaufort wrote to Athos . 
The letter destined for the living only reached the dead . 
God had changed the address . 
`` MY DEAR COMTE , '' wrote the prince , in his large , school-boy 's hand , - `` a great misfortune has struck us amidst a great triumph . 
The king loses one of the bravest of soldiers . 
I lose a friend . 
You lose M. de Bragelonne . 
He has died gloriously , so gloriously that I have not the strength to weep as I could wish . 
Receive my sad compliments , my dear comte .
