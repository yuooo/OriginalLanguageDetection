He remarked upon the cheeks of Athos the hectic hue of fever , which feeds upon itself ; slow fever , pitiless , born in a fold of the heart , sheltering itself behind that rampart , growing from the suffering it engenders , at once cause and effect of a perilous situation . 
The comte spoke to nobody ; he did not even talk to himself . 
His thought feared noise ; it approached to that degree of over-excitement which borders upon ecstasy . 
Man thus absorbed , though he does not yet belong to God , already appertains no longer to the earth . 
The doctor remained for several hours studying this painful struggle of the will against superior power ; he was terrified at seeing those eyes always fixed , ever directed on some invisible object ; was terrified at the monotonous beating of that heart from which never a sigh arose to vary the melancholy state ; for often pain becomes the hope of the physician . 
Half a day passed away thus . 
The doctor formed his resolution like a brave man ; he issued suddenly from his place of retreat , and went straight up to Athos , who beheld him without evincing more surprise than if he had understood nothing of the apparition . 
`` Monsieur le comte , I crave your pardon , '' said the doctor , coming up to the patient with open arms ; `` but I have a reproach to make you - you shall hear me . '' 
And he seated himself by the pillow of Athos , who had great trouble in rousing himself from his preoccupation . 
`` What is the matter , doctor ? ''
