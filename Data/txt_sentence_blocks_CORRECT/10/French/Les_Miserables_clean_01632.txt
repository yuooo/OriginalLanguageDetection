Thus he went from time to time , to Comte Pajol , to General Bellavesne , to General Fririon , to the Invalides . 
There was music and dancing there . 
On such evenings , Marius put on his new coat . 
But he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold , because he could not afford a carriage , and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors . 
He said sometimes , but without bitterness : `` Men are so made that in a drawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes . 
In order to insure a good reception there , only one irreproachable thing is asked of you ; your conscience ? 
No , your boots . '' 
All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery . 
Marius ' political fevers vanished thus . 
The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the process , by satisfying and calming him .
