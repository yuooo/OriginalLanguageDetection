`` I fancy you already on your road , my dear little sister , consoled for all your griefs . '' 
`` I will go , on two conditions . 
The first is , that I shall know what I am negotiating about . '' 
`` That is it . 
The Dutch , you know , insult me daily in their gazettes , and by their republican attitude . 
I do not like republics . '' 
`` That may easily be imagined , sire . '' 
`` I see with pain that these kings of the sea - they call themselves so - keep trade from France in the Indies , and that their vessels will soon occupy all the ports of Europe . 
Such a power is too near me , sister . '' 
`` They are your allies , nevertheless . ''
