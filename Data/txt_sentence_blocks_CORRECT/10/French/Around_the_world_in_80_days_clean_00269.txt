Fix had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose ; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg . 
During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman . 
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands . 
Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , `` I should play a diamond . '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix raised their heads , and beheld Colonel Proctor . 
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , is it , Englishman ? '' 
cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! '' 
`` And who plays it , '' replied Phileas Fogg coolly , throwing down the ten of spades .
