`` Beware ! '' 
she shouted . 
All crowded back towards the corridor . 
A broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret . 
The Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned , and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents : -- `` The cowards ! '' 
Javert smiled , and advanced across the open space which the Thenardier was devouring with her eyes . 
`` Do n't come near me , '' she cried , `` or I 'll crush you . '' 
`` What a grenadier ! '' 
ejaculated Javert ; `` you 've got a beard like a man , mother , but I have claws like a woman . '' 
And he continued to advance .
