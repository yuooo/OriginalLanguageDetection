There 's a soldier on guard yonder . 
We shall get nabbed here . '' 
These two words , icigo and icicaille , both of which mean ici , and which belong , the first to the slang of the barriers , the second to the slang of the Temple , were flashes of light for Thenardier . 
By the icigo he recognized Brujon , who was a prowler of the barriers , by the icicaille he knew Babet , who , among his other trades , had been an old-clothes broker at the Temple . 
The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the Temple , and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity . 
Had it not been for the icicaille , Thenardier would not have recognized him , for he had entirely changed his voice . 
In the meanwhile , the third man had intervened . 
`` There 's no hurry yet , let 's wait a bit . 
How do we know that he does n't stand in need of us ? '' 
By this , which was nothing but French , Thenardier recognized Montparnasse , who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speak none of them .
