On some semi-official occasion or other , I do not recollect what , Count *** -LSB- this senator -RSB- and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect . 
At dessert , the senator , who was slightly exhilarated , though still perfectly dignified , exclaimed : -- `` Egad , Bishop , let 's have a discussion . 
It is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking . 
We are two augurs . 
I am going to make a confession to you . 
I have a philosophy of my own . '' 
`` And you are right , '' replied the Bishop . 
`` As one makes one 's philosophy , so one lies on it . 
You are on the bed of purple , senator . '' 
The senator was encouraged , and went on : -- `` Let us be good fellows . ''
