Formerly he had come in his old coat , now he wore his new one every day ; Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled , his eyes were very queer , he wore gloves ; in short , Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man . 
Cosette allowed nothing to be divined . 
Without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it , and that it must be concealed . 
There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to Cosette , and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean . 
It might be accidental , no doubt , certainly , but it was a menacing accident . 
He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger . 
One day , however , he could not refrain from so doing , and , with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair , he said to her : `` What a very pedantic air that young man has ! '' 
Cosette , but a year before only an indifferent little girl , would have replied : `` Why , no , he is charming . '' 
Ten years later , with the love of Marius in her heart , she would have answered : `` A pedant , and insufferable to the sight ! 
You are right ! ''
