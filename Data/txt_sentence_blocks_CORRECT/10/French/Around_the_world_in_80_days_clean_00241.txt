` Cisco was reached at seven in the morning ; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car , and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming . 
The railway track wound in and out among the passes , now approaching the mountain-sides , now suspended over precipices , avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves , plunging into narrow defiles , which seemed to have no outlet . 
The locomotive , its great funnel emitting a weird light , with its sharp bell , and its cow-catcher extended like a spur , mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades , and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines . 
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route . 
The railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another . 
The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock , going always northeasterly ; and at midday reached Reno , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast . 
From this point the road , running along Humboldt River , passed northward for several miles by its banks ; then it turned eastward , and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range , nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada . 
Having breakfasted , Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . 
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . 
These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks .
