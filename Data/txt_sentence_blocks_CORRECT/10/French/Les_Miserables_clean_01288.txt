`` What is this dead-room ? '' 
`` It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden , which is closed on the outside by a shutter , and two doors ; one leads into the convent , the other into the church . '' 
`` What church ? '' 
`` The church in the street , the church which any one can enter . '' 
`` Have you the keys to those two doors ? '' 
`` No ; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent ; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church . '' 
`` When does the porter open that door ? '' 
`` Only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter , when they come to get the coffin . 
When the coffin has been taken out , the door is closed again . ''
