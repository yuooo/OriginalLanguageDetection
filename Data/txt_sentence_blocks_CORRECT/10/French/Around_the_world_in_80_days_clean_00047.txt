`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a Frenchman , and ca n't help talking . 
Excuse me for a little while , consul . '' 
Fix started off in search of Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin . 
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` Left Paris , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` Left Turin , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158 + ; or , in days , six days and a half . '' 
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . 
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . 
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . 
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE , PERHAPS , THAN IS PRUDENT Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything .
