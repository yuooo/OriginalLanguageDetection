demanded her father . 
`` No , '' replied the girl , `` but as his key is in the door , he must be out . '' 
The father exclaimed : -- `` Go in , nevertheless . ''

She was as she had been in the morning , only still more repulsive in this light . 
She walked straight up to the bed . 
Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety ; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall , and it was thither that she was directing her steps . 
She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it . 
In the neighboring room , the sound of iron articles being moved was audible .
