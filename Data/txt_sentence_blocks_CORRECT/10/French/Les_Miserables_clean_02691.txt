The insurgents , surprised but not terrified , had rallied . 
Enjolras had shouted : `` Wait ! 
Do n't fire at random ! '' 
In the first confusion , they might , in fact , wound each other . 
The majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story and to the attic windows , whence they commanded the assailants . 
The most determined , with Enjolras , Courfeyrac , Jean Prouvaire , and Combeferre , had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear , unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade . 
All this was accomplished without haste , with that strange and threatening gravity which precedes engagements . 
They took aim , point blank , on both sides : they were so close that they could talk together without raising their voices . 
When they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of darting forth , an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said : -- `` Lay down your arms ! '' 
`` Fire ! ''
