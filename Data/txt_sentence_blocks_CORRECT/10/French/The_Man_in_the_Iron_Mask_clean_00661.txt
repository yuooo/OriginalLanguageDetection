`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . ''
