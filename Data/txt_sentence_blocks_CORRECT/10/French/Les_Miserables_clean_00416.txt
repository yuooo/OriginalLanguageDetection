Therein lay his connection with humanity . 
The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry of Justice designates under the rubric , Vagrants . 
The name of Javert routed them by its mere utterance ; the face of Javert petrified them at sight . 
Such was this formidable man . 
Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine . 
An eye full of suspicion and conjecture . 
M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact ; but it seemed to be of no importance to him . 
He did not even put a question to Javert ; he neither sought nor avoided him ; he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it . 
He treated Javert with ease and courtesy , as he did all the rest of the world . 
It was divined , from some words which escaped Javert , that he had secretly investigated , with that curiosity which belongs to the race , and into which there enters as much instinct as will , all the anterior traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere .
