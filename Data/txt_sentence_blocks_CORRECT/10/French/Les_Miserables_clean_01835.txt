He inspired fear and confidence . 
Marius related the adventure to him : That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight , was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening ; that , as he occupied the room adjoining the den , he , Marius Pontmercy , a lawyer , had heard the whole plot through the partition ; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette ; that there would be accomplices , probably some prowlers of the barriers , among others a certain Panchaud , alias Printanier , alias Bigrenaille ; that Jondrette 's daughters were to lie in wait ; that there was no way of warning the threatened man , since he did not even know his name ; and that , finally , all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening , at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital , in house No. 50-52 . 
At the sound of this number , the inspector raised his head , and said coldly : -- `` So it is in the room at the end of the corridor ? '' 
`` Precisely , '' answered Marius , and he added : `` Are you acquainted with that house ? '' 
The inspector remained silent for a moment , then replied , as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove : -- `` Apparently . '' 
He went on , muttering between his teeth , and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat : -- `` Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this . '' 
This word struck Marius . 
`` Patron-Minette , '' said he , `` I did hear that word pronounced , in fact . '' 
And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier . 
The inspector muttered : -- `` The long-haired man must be Brujon , and the bearded one Demi-Liard , alias Deux-Milliards . ''
