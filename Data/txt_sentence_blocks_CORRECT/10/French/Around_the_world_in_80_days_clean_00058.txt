The Mongolia , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time . 
The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay , others for Calcutta by way of Bombay , the nearest route thither , now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula . 
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades , the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops , and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company : for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds , brigadiers , 2,400 pounds , and generals of divisions , 4,000 pounds . 
What with the military men , a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels , and the hospitable efforts of the purser , the time passed quickly on the Mongolia . 
The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and the eight o'clock supper , and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day ; and the hours were whirled away , when the sea was tranquil , with music , dancing , and games . 
But the Red Sea is full of caprice , and often boisterous , like most long and narrow gulfs . 
When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia , with her long hull , rolled fearfully . 
Then the ladies speedily disappeared below ; the pianos were silent ; singing and dancing suddenly ceased . 
Yet the good ship ploughed straight on , unretarded by wind or wave , towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb . 
What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time ?
