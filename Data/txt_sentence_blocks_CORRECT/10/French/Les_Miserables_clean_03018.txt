It is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking . 
If the other allowed him to walk on , and had not seized him as yet , it was , judging from all appearances , in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant meeting-place and to some group worth catching . 
This delicate operation is called `` spinning . '' 
What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-up man , on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quay as it was passing along empty , made a sign to the driver ; the driver understood , evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal , turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay , at a foot-pace . 
This was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance . 
The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Elysees . 
The bust of the driver , whip in hand , could be seen moving along above the parapet . 
One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article : `` Always have on hand a hackney-coach , in case of emergency . '' 
While these two men were manoeuvring , each on his own side , with irreproachable strategy , they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore , and which permitted cab-drivers arriving from Passy to come to the river and water their horses . 
This inclined plane was suppressed later on , for the sake of symmetry ; horses may die of thirst , but the eye is gratified .
