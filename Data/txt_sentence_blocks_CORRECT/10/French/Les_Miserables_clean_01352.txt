We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope , Leo XII. , to one of his relatives , a Monsignor in the Nuncio 's establishment in Paris , and bearing , like himself , the name of Della Genga ; it contained these lines : `` It appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent gardener , who is also a holy man , named Fauvent . '' 
Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut ; he went on grafting , weeding , and covering up his melon beds , without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity . 
Neither did he suspect his glory , any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the London Illustrated News , with this inscription : `` Bull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show . '' 
CLOISTERED Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent . 
It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean 's daughter . 
Moreover , as she knew nothing , she could say nothing , and then , she would not have said anything in any case . 
As we have just observed , nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness . 
Cosette had suffered so much , that she feared everything , even to speak or to breathe . 
A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her . 
She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean .
