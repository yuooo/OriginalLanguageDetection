`` It is the mildest term that I can find , '' pursued the king . 
`` My idea was to take and punish rebels ; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels were your friends or not ? '' 
`` But I was , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` It was a cruelty on your majesty 's part to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets . '' 
`` It was a trial I had to make , monsieur , of pretended servants , who eat my bread and should defend my person . 
The trial has succeeded ill , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` For one bad servant your majesty loses , '' said the musketeer , with bitterness , `` there are ten who , on that same day , go through a like ordeal . 
Listen to me , sire ; I am not accustomed to that service .
