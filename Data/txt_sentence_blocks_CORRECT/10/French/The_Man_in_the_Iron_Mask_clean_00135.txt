`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . '' 
`` Wo n't it be of use to him , indeed ? 
I believe you , it will , and that in the highest degree ; - for you see my friend Moliere is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons , comtes , and marquises - according to their measure . '' 
On this observation , neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss , D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin 's house and rejoined their carriages , wherein we will leave them , in order to look after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande . 
: The Bee-Hive , the Bees , and the Honey . 
The bishop of Vannes , much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin 's , returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor .
