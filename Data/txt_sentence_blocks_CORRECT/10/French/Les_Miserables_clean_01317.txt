He had a certain sensation of cold . 
A voice rose above him , glacial and solemn . 
He heard Latin words , which he did not understand , pass over him , so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one : -- `` Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere , evigilabunt ; alii in vitam aeternam , et alii in approbrium , ut videant semper . '' 
A child 's voice said : -- `` De profundis . '' 
The grave voice began again : -- `` Requiem aeternam dona ei , Domine . '' 
The child 's voice responded : -- `` Et lux perpetua luceat ei . '' 
He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him . 
It was probably the holy water . 
He thought : `` This will be over soon now . 
Patience for a little while longer .
