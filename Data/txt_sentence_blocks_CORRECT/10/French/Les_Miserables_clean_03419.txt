There was one inconvenience about these clothes , they `` did not fit '' ; not having been made for those who wore them , they were too tight for one , too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one . 
Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer 's costumes . 
It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean . 
The changer had foreseen only ordinary men . 
He had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand , who is neither stout nor thin , neither tall nor short . 
Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer 's clients extricated themselves as best they might . 
So much the worse for the exceptions ! 
The suit of the statesman , for instance , black from head to foot , and consequently proper , would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala . 
The costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the Changer 's catalogue ; we copy : `` A coat of black cloth , trowsers of black wool , a silk waistcoat , boots and linen . '' 
On the margin there stood : ex-ambassador , and a note which we also copy : `` In a separate box , a neatly frizzed peruke , green glasses , seals , and two small quills an inch long , wrapped in cotton . ''
