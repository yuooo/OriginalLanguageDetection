`` No , not exactly . 
I beg your pardon , my good Mouston . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not in fault , monsieur , '' said Mouston , graciously . 
`` You were in Paris , and as for us , we were at Pierrefonds . '' 
`` Well , well , my dear Porthos ; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat . 
Is that what you wished to say ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend ; and I greatly rejoice over the period . '' 
`` Indeed , I believe you do , '' exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` You understand , '' continued Porthos , `` what a world of trouble it spared for me . ''
