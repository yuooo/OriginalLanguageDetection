He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen , and that the stokers fired up like heroes . 
His loquacious good-humour infected everyone . 
He had forgotten the past , its vexations and delays . 
He only thought of the end , so nearly accomplished ; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience , as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta . 
Often , also , the worthy fellow revolved around Fix , looking at him with a keen , distrustful eye ; but he did not speak to him , for their old intimacy no longer existed . 
Fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . 
The conquest of the Henrietta , the bribery of the crew , Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him . 
He did not know what to think . 
For , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg 's command , was not going to Liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety . 
The conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .
