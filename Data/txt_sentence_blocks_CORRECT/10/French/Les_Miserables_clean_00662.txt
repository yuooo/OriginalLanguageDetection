The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court , if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident , to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban , and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence . 
The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence . 
He was violent and florid , as district-attorneys usually are . 
He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his `` loyalty , '' and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty . 
He reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer . 
The advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean . 
He took note of this . 
So this man was Jean Valjean . 
This point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed . 
Here , by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime , the district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school , then dawning under the name of the Satanic school , which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and the Oriflamme ; he attributed , not without some probability , to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu , or rather , to speak more correctly , of Jean Valjean .
