They exchanged a few words in a low tone . 
The man had again become absorbed in his reflections . 
The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace , laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man , and said to him : -- `` You are going to get out of here . '' 
The stranger turned round and replied gently , `` Ah ! 
You know ? 
-- '' `` Yes . '' 
`` I was sent away from the other inn . '' 
`` And you are to be turned out of this one . '' 
`` Where would you have me go ? ''
