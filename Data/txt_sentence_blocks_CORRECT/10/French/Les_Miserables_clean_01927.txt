Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and the prisoner . 
These men , through the black masks or paste which covered their faces , and made of them , at fear 's pleasure , charcoal-burners , negroes , or demons , had a stupid and gloomy air , and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work , tranquilly , without either wrath or mercy , with a sort of ennui . 
They were crowded together in one corner like brutes , and remained silent . 
Thenardier warmed his feet . 
The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity . 
A sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before . 
The candle , on which a large `` stranger '' had formed , cast but a dim light in the immense hovel , the brazier had grown dull , and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling . 
No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man , who was fast asleep . 
Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle .
