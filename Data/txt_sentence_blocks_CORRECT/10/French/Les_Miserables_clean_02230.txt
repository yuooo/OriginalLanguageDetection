And she sank down as though on the point of death . 
He grasped her , she fell , he took her in his arms , he pressed her close , without knowing what he was doing . 
He supported her , though he was tottering himself . 
It was as though his brain were full of smoke ; lightnings darted between his lips ; his ideas vanished ; it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act , and that he was committing a profanation . 
Moreover , he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast . 
He was beside himself with love . 
She took his hand and laid it on her heart . 
He felt the paper there , he stammered : -- `` You love me , then ? '' 
She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath : -- `` Hush ! 
Thou knowest it ! ''
