It was with this full power , and the conviction that she was doing right , that the superintendent had instituted the suit , judged , condemned , and executed Fantine . 
As regards the fifty francs , she had given them from a fund which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes , and for giving assistance to the workwomen , and of which she rendered no account . 
Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood ; she went from house to house . 
No one would have her . 
She could not leave town . 
The second-hand dealer , to whom she was in debt for her furniture -- and what furniture ! 
-- said to her , `` If you leave , I will have you arrested as a thief . '' 
The householder , whom she owed for her rent , said to her , `` You are young and pretty ; you can pay . '' 
She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer , returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods , kept only necessaries , and found herself without work , without a trade , with nothing but her bed , and still about fifty francs in debt . 
She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison , and earned twelve sous a day .
