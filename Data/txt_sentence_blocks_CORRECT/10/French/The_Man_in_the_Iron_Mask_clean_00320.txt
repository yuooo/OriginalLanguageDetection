That man is too much for me ; he is my mortal enemy , but he shall forthwith fall ! 
I hate him - I hate him - I hate him ! '' 
and as he pronounced these words , he struck the arm of the chair in which he was sitting violently , over and over again , and then rose like one in an epileptic fit . 
`` To-morrow ! 
to-morrow ! 
oh , happy day ! '' 
he murmured , `` when the sun rises , no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess but me . 
That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject ruin my anger shall have wrought , they will be forced to confess at last and at least that I am indeed greater than he . '' 
The king , who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer , knocked over with a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside , and in the very bitterness of anger , almost weeping , and half-suffocated , he threw himself on his bed , dressed as he was , and bit the sheets in his extremity of passion , trying to find repose of body at least there . 
The bed creaked beneath his weight , and with the exception of a few broken sounds , emerging , or , one might say , exploding , from his overburdened chest , absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus .
