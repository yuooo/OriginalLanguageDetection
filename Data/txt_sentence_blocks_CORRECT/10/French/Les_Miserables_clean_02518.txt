All at once , a man on horseback , clad in black , made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag , others say , with a pike surmounted with a red liberty-cap . 
Lafayette turned aside his head . 
Exelmans quitted the procession . 
This red flag raised a storm , and disappeared in the midst of it . 
From the Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude . 
Two prodigious shouts went up : `` Lamarque to the Pantheon ! 
-- Lafayette to the Town-hall ! '' 
Some young men , amid the declamations of the throng , harnessed themselves and began to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz and Lafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland . 
In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette , it was noticed that a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder , who died a centenarian afterwards , who had also been in the war of 1776 , and who had fought at Trenton under Washington , and at Brandywine under Lafayette . 
In the meantime , the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion , and came to bar the bridge , on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the Celestins and deployed along the Quai Morland .
