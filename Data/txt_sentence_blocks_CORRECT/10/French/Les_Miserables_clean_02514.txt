Pretot , who was destined to perish also in the struggle , seconded Mavot , and to the question : `` What is your object ? '' 
he replied : `` Insurrection . '' 
Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy , waited for a certain Lemarin , the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg Saint-Marceau . 
Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly . 
On the 5th of June , accordingly , a day of mingled rain and sun , General Lamarque 's funeral procession traversed Paris with official military pomp , somewhat augmented through precaution . 
Two battalions , with draped drums and reversed arms , ten thousand National Guards , with their swords at their sides , escorted the coffin . 
The hearse was drawn by young men . 
The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it , bearing laurel branches . 
Then came an innumerable , strange , agitated multitude , the sectionaries of the Friends of the People , the Law School , the Medical School , refugees of all nationalities , and Spanish , Italian , German , and Polish flags , tricolored horizontal banners , every possible sort of banner , children waving green boughs , stone-cutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment , printers who were recognizable by their paper caps , marching two by two , three by three , uttering cries , nearly all of them brandishing sticks , some brandishing sabres , without order and yet with a single soul , now a tumultuous rout , again a column . 
Squads chose themselves leaders ; a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view , seemed to pass the host in review , and the files separated before him .
