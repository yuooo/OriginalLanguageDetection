With monseigneur were the oldest captains and his aides-de-camp . 
M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne had received orders not to leave his highness . 
In the meantime the enemy 's cannon , which at first thundered with little success against the masses , began to regulate their fire , and the balls , better directed , killed several men near the prince . 
The regiments formed in column , and , advancing against the ramparts , were rather roughly handled . 
There was a sort of hesitation in our troops , who found themselves ill-seconded by the artillery . 
In fact , the batteries which had been established the evening before had but a weak and uncertain aim , on account of their position . 
The upward direction of the aim lessened the justness of the shots as well as their range . 
`` Monseigneur , comprehending the bad effect of this position on the siege artillery , commanded the frigates moored in the little road to commence a regular fire against the place . 
M. de Bragelonne offered himself at once to carry this order . 
But monseigneur refused to acquiesce in the vicomte 's request .
