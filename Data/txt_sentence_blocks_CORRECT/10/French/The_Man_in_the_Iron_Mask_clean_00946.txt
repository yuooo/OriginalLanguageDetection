Woe be to you , Biscarrat ! '' 
`` You are the cause of my being wounded unto death , '' said one of the young men , letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm , and spattering it into Biscarrat 's livid face . 
`` My blood be on your head ! '' 
And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man . 
`` But , at least , tell us who is there ? '' 
cried several furious voices . 
Biscarrat remained silent . 
`` Tell us , or die ! '' 
cried the wounded man , raising himself upon one knee , and lifting towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword . 
Biscarrat rushed towards him , opening his breast for the blow , but the wounded man fell back not to rise again , uttering a groan which was his last .
