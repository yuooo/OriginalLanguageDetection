He had viewed , almost tranquilly , that coupling of words , in the Moniteur : M. Humblot-Conte , peer of France . 
The fact is , that the old man was deeply dejected . 
He did not bend , he did not yield ; this was no more a characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature , but he felt himself giving way internally . 
For four years he had been waiting for Marius , with his foot firmly planted , that is the exact word , in the conviction that that good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other ; now he had reached the point , where , at certain gloomy hours , he said to himself , that if Marius made him wait much longer -- It was not death that was insupportable to him ; it was the idea that perhaps he should never see Marius again . 
The idea of never seeing Marius again had never entered his brain until that day ; now the thought began to recur to him , and it chilled him . 
Absence , as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments , had only served to augment the grandfather 's love for the ungrateful child , who had gone off like a flash . 
It is during December nights , when the cold stands at ten degrees , that one thinks oftenest of the son . 
M. Gillenormand was , or thought himself , above all things , incapable of taking a single step , he -- the grandfather , towards his grandson ; `` I would die rather , '' he said to himself . 
He did not consider himself as the least to blame ; but he thought of Marius only with profound tenderness , and the mute despair of an elderly , kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark . 
He began to lose his teeth , which added to his sadness .
