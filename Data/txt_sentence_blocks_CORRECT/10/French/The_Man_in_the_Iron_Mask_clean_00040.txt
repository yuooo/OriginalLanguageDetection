`` This also was done by design , then ; just as they deprived you of mirrors , which reflect the present , so they left you in ignorance of history , which reflects the past .

`` It is true , '' said the young man . 
`` Listen , then ; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France during the last twenty-three or twenty-four years ; that is , from the probable date of your birth ; in a word , from the time that interests you . '' 
`` Say on . '' 
And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude . 
`` Do you know who was the son of Henry IV . ? ''
