`` You have a charming cravat on this morning , Marius . 
You are very dandified , monseigneur . 
No , it will not bore me . '' 
`` I assure you that it will bore you . '' 
`` No . 
Since it is you . 
I shall not understand you , but I shall listen to you . 
When one hears the voices of those whom one loves , one does not need to understand the words that they utter . 
That we should be here together -- that is all that I desire . 
I shall remain with you , bah ! ''
