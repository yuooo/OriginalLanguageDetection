Courfeyrac , to whom he confided nothing , -- it was his nature , -- but who made some little guess at everything , -- that was his nature , -- had begun by congratulating him on being in love , though he was amazed at it ; then , seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state , he ended by saying to him : `` I see that you have been simply an animal . 
Here , come to the Chaumiere . '' 
Once , having confidence in a fine September sun , Marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac , Bossuet , and Grantaire , hoping , what a dream ! 
that he might , perhaps , find her there . 
Of course he did not see the one he sought . 
-- `` But this is the place , all the same , where all lost women are found , '' grumbled Grantaire in an aside . 
Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot , alone , through the night , weary , feverish , with sad and troubled eyes , stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast , which passed close to him , as he , in his discouragement , breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees , along the road , in order to refresh his head . 
He took to living more and more alone , utterly overwhelmed , wholly given up to his inward anguish , going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap , seeking the absent one everywhere , stupefied by love . 
On another occasion , he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect .
