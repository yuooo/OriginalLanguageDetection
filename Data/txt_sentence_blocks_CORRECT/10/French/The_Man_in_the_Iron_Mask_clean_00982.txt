Of what service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries , and in the midst of them Mousqueton , proud of the power delegated by thee ! 
Oh , noble Porthos ! 
careful heaper-up of treasure , was it worth while to labor to sweeten and gild life , to come upon a desert shore , surrounded by the cries of seagulls , and lay thyself , with broken bones , beneath a torpid stone ? 
Was it worth while , in short , noble Porthos , to heap so much gold , and not have even the distich of a poor poet engraven upon thy monument ? 
Valiant Porthos ! 
he still , without doubt , sleeps , lost , forgotten , beneath the rock the shepherds of the heath take for the gigantic abode of a dolmen . 
And so many twining branches , so many mosses , bent by the bitter wind of ocean , so many lichens solder thy sepulcher to earth , that no passers-by will imagine such a block of granite could ever have been supported by the shoulders of one man . 
Aramis , still pale , still icy-cold , his heart upon his lips , looked , even till , with the last ray of daylight , the shore faded on the horizon . 
Not a word escaped him , not a sigh rose from his deep breast . 
The superstitious Bretons looked upon him , trembling .
