Gavroche retorted again : -- `` What villainous words ! 
You must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck . '' 
The sergeant lowered his bayonet . 
`` Will you tell me where you are going , you wretch ? '' 
`` General , '' said Gavroche `` I 'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor . '' 
`` To arms ! '' 
shouted the sergeant . 
The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them ; Gavroche took in the whole situation at a glance . 
It was the cart which had told against him , it was the cart 's place to protect him . 
At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on Gavroche , the cart , converted into a projectile and launched with all the latter 's might , rolled down upon him furiously , and the sergeant , struck full in the stomach , tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air .
