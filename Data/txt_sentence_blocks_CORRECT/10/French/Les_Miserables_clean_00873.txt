That is a solar fact . 
Blind is he who will not see ! 
It was Bonaparte who said it . 
The war of 1823 , an outrage on the generous Spanish nation , was then , at the same time , an outrage on the French Revolution . 
It was France who committed this monstrous violence ; by foul means , for , with the exception of wars of liberation , everything that armies do is by foul means . 
The words passive obedience indicate this . 
An army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence . 
Thus is war , made by humanity against humanity , despite humanity , explained . 
As for the Bourbons , the war of 1823 was fatal to them . 
They took it for a success .
