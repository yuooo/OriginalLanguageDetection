`` In prison , in the city prison , while waiting to be transferred . '' 
`` Until he is transferred ! '' 
`` He is to be transferred ! '' 
`` Where is he to be taken ? '' 
`` He will be tried at the Assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago . '' 
`` Well ! 
I suspected as much . 
That man was too good , too perfect , too affected . 
He refused the cross ; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across . 
I always thought there was some evil history back of all that . ''
