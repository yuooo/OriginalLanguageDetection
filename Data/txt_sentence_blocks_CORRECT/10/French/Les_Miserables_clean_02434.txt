Tell me , will you do this for me , and cease to weep ? '' 
`` Do you love me ? '' 
said she . 
He took her hand . 
`` Cosette , I have never given my word of honor to any one , because my word of honor terrifies me . 
I feel that my father is by my side . 
Well , I give you my most sacred word of honor , that if you go away I shall die . '' 
In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil , that Cosette trembled . 
She felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by . 
The shock made her cease weeping .
