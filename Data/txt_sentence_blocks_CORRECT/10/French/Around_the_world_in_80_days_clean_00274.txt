replied Mr. Fogg , returning to the car as coolly as usual . 
He began to reassure Aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse . 
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness . 
At eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station . 
Mr. Fogg rose , and , followed by Fix , went out upon the platform . 
Passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . 
Aouda remained in the car , as pale as death . 
The door of the next car opened , and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second . 
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , `` You ca n't get off , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Why not ? ''
