The younger wedded the man of her dreams , but she died . 
The elder did not marry at all . 
At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating , she was an antique virtue , an incombustible prude , with one of the sharpest noses , and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see . 
A characteristic detail ; outside of her immediate family , no one had ever known her first name . 
She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand , the elder . 
In the matter of cant , Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given points to a miss . 
Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness . 
She cherished a frightful memory of her life ; one day , a man had beheld her garter . 
Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty . 
Her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque , and never ascended sufficiently high .
