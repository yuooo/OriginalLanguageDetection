The grave-digger resumed : -- `` Peasant , I have seven small children who must be fed . 
As they must eat , I can not drink . '' 
And he added , with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well : -- `` Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst . '' 
The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees , quitted the grand alley , turned into a narrow one , entered the waste land , and plunged into a thicket . 
This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture . 
Fauchelevent slackened his pace , but he could not detain the hearse . 
Fortunately , the soil , which was light and wet with the winter rains , clogged the wheels and retarded its speed . 
He approached the grave-digger . 
`` They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine , '' murmured Fauchelevent . 
`` Villager , '' retorted the man , `` I ought not be a grave-digger .
