To sum up , in conclusion , that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out , we will confine ourselves to the statement that , in the course of nineteen years , Jean Valjean , the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles , the formidable convict of Toulon , had become capable , thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him , of two sorts of evil action : firstly , of evil action which was rapid , unpremeditated , dashing , entirely instinctive , in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone ; secondly , of evil action which was serious , grave , consciously argued out and premeditated , with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish . 
His deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases , which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse , -- reasoning , will , perseverance . 
He had for moving causes his habitual wrath , bitterness of soul , a profound sense of indignities suffered , the reaction even against the good , the innocent , and the just , if there are any such . 
The point of departure , like the point of arrival , for all his thoughts , was hatred of human law ; that hatred which , if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident , becomes , within a given time , the hatred of society , then the hatred of the human race , then the hatred of creation , and which manifests itself by a vague , incessant , and brutal desire to do harm to some living being , no matter whom . 
It will be perceived that it was not without reason that Jean Valjean 's passport described him as a very dangerous man . 
From year to year this soul had dried away slowly , but with fatal sureness . 
When the heart is dry , the eye is dry . 
On his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear . 
BILLOWS AND SHADOWS A man overboard ! 
What matters it ?
