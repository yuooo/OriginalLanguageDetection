The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who carried away from the pillage of palace a kettle at the bottom of which was concealed a bag of gold , and whom everybody allowed to pass without jealousy , - this fable had become a truth in the prince 's mansion . 
Many contractors paid themselves upon the offices of the duke . 
Thus , the provision department , who plundered the clothes-presses and the harness-rooms , attached very little value to things which tailors and saddlers set great store by . 
Anxious to carry home to their wives presents given them by monseigneur , many were seen bounding joyously along , under the weight of earthen jars and bottles , gloriously stamped with the arms of the prince . 
M. de Beaufort finished by giving away his horses and the hay from his lofts . 
He made more than thirty happy with kitchen utensils ; and thirty more with the contents of his cellar . 
Still further ; all these people went away with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in this manner to prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs ' tents . 
They repeated to each other , while pillaging his hotel , that he was sent to Gigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes ; that the treasures of Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and the king of France ; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds , or other fabulous stones ; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not even obtain the honor of being named . 
In addition to the mines to be worked -- which could not be begun till after the campaign - there would be the booty made by the army . 
M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on all the riches pirates had robbed Christendom of since the battle of Lepanto .
