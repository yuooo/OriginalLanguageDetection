When he entered , he was asked : `` Whence come you ? '' 
He replied : `` From the street . '' 
When he went away , they asked him : `` Whither are you going ? '' 
He replied : `` Into the streets . ''

This child lived , in this absence of affection , like the pale plants which spring up in cellars .

Nevertheless , his mother loved his sisters . 
We have forgotten to mention , that on the Boulevard du Temple this child was called Little Gavroche .
