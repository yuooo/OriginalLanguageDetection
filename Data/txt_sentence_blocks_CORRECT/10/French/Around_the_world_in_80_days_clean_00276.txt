`` It would be perfectly so , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
`` Well , we are really in America , '' thought Passepartout , `` and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order ! '' 
So muttering , he followed his master . 
The two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train . 
The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle . 
The passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform . 
The car , which was some fifty feet long , was very convenient for their purpose . 
The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle , and fire at their ease . 
Never was duel more easily arranged . 
Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor , each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers , entered the car .
