The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off . 
Isabeau ran out in haste ; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs . 
Isabeau ran after him and stopped him . 
The thief had flung away the loaf , but his arm was still bleeding . 
It was Jean Valjean . 
This took place in 1795 . 
Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night . 
He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world , he was a bit of a poacher , and this injured his case . 
There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers . 
The poacher , like the smuggler , smacks too strongly of the brigand .
