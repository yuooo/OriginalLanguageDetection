This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him , and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud . 
Bossuet burst out laughing . 
`` Who is that man ? '' 
`` He ? '' 
retorted Courfeyrac , `` he 's a poet . 
Poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of France . '' 
`` Let 's see where Marius will go , '' said Bossuet ; `` let 's see where the man is going , let 's follow them , hey ? '' 
`` Bossuet ! '' 
exclaimed Courfeyrac , `` eagle of Meaux ! 
You are a prodigious brute .
