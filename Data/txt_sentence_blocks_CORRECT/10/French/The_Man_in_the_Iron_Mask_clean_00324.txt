Then , addressing himself to the man who held the lamp in his hand , he said : `` What is this , monsieur , and what is the meaning of this jest ? '' 
`` It is no jest , '' replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the lantern . 
`` Do you belong to M. Fouquet ? '' 
inquired the king , greatly astonished at his situation . 
`` It matters very little to whom we belong , '' said the phantom ; `` we are your masters now , that is sufficient . '' 
The king , more impatient than intimidated , turned to the other masked figure . 
`` If this is a comedy , '' he said , `` you will tell M. Fouquet that I find it unseemly and improper , and that I command it should cease . '' 
The second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a man of huge stature and vast circumference . 
He held himself erect and motionless as any block of marble . 
`` Well ! ''
