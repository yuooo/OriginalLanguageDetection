Louis held up the massive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use . 
`` Sire , '' said Fouquet , in a voice trembling with emotion , `` do you not recognize the most faithful of your friends ? '' 
`` A friend - you ! '' 
repeated Louis , gnashing his teeth in a manner which betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance . 
`` The most respectful of your servants , '' added Fouquet , throwing himself on his knees . 
The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp . 
Fouquet approached him , kissed his knees , and took him in his arms with inconceivable tenderness . 
`` My king , my child , '' he said , `` how you must have suffered ! '' 
Louis , recalled to himself by the change of situation , looked at himself , and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel , ashamed of his conduct , and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was shown towards him , drew back . 
Fouquet did not understand this movement ; he did not perceive that the king 's feeling of pride would never forgive him for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness .
