It often occurred that he forgot the day had half passed away , that the hours for the two first meals were gone by . 
Then he was awakened . 
He rose , descended to his shady walk , then came out a little into the sun , as though to partake of its warmth for a minute in memory of his absent child . 
And then the dismal monotonous walk recommenced , until , exhausted , he regained the chamber and his bed , his domicile by choice . 
For several days the comte did not speak a single word . 
He refused to receive the visits that were paid him , and during the night he was seen to relight his lamp and pass long hours in writing , or examining parchments . 
Athos wrote one of these letters to Vannes , another to Fontainebleau ; they remained without answers . 
We know why : Aramis had quitted France , and D'Artagnan was traveling from Nantes to Paris , from Paris to Pierrefonds . 
His valet de chambre observed that he shortened his walk every day by several turns . 
The great alley of limes soon became too long for feet that used to traverse it formerly a hundred times a day .
