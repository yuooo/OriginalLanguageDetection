Providence has willed that you should be persecuted ; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of France . 
You had , then , a right to reign , seeing that it is disputed ; you had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed ; and you possess royal blood , since no one has dared to shed yours , as that of your servants has been shed . 
Now see , then , what this Providence , which you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you , has done for you . 
It has given you the features , figure , age , and voice of your brother ; and the very causes of your persecution are about to become those of your triumphant restoration . 
To-morrow , after to-morrow - from the very first , regal phantom , living shade of Louis XIV. , you will sit upon his throne , whence the will of Heaven , confided in execution to the arm of man , will have hurled him , without hope of return . '' 
`` I understand , '' said the prince , `` my brother 's blood will not be shed , then . '' 
`` You will be sole arbiter of his fate . '' 
`` The secret of which they made an evil use against me ? '' 
`` You will employ it against him . 
What did he do to conceal it ?
