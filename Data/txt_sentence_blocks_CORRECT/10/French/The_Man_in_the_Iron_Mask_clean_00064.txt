I 'll wager that you alone in France have so many ; and suppose you never had any more made , and were to live to be a hundred years of age , which would n't astonish me in the very least , you could still wear a new dress the day of your death , without being obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then .

Porthos shook his head . 
`` Come , my friend , '' said D'Artagnan , `` this unnatural melancholy in you frightens me . 
My dear Porthos , pray get it out , then . 
And the sooner the better . '' 
`` Yes , my friend , so I will : if , indeed , it is possible . '' 
`` Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux ? '' 
`` No : they have felled the wood , and it has yielded a third more than the estimate . '' 
`` Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds ? '' 
`` No , my friend : they have been fished , and there is enough left to stock all the pools in the neighborhood . ''
