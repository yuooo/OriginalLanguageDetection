The anxiety in which , for three days , London society existed , can not be described . 
Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg . 
Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening . 
No news . 
The police were ignorant what had become of the detective , Fix , who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent . 
Bets increased , nevertheless , in number and value . 
Phileas Fogg , like a racehorse , was drawing near his last turning-point . 
The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour . 
A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the Reform Club . 
Circulation was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on .
