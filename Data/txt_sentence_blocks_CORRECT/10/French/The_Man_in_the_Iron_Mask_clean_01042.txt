A king does not allow himself to soften save at the tears of the innocent , the remorse of the guilty . 
I have no faith either in the remorse of M. Fouquet or the tears of his friends , because the one is tainted to the very heart , and the others ought to dread offending me in my own palace . 
For these reasons , I beg you , Monsieur Pelisson , Monsieur Gourville , and you , Monsieur - , to say nothing that will not plainly proclaim the respect you have for my will . '' 
`` Sire , '' replied Pelisson , trembling at these words , `` we are come to say nothing to your majesty that is not the most profound expression of the most sincere respect and love that are due to a king from all his subjects . 
Your majesty 's justice is redoubtable ; every one must yield to the sentences it pronounces . 
We respectfully bow before it . 
Far from us the idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend your majesty . 
He who has incurred your displeasure may be a friend of ours , but he is an enemy to the state . 
We abandon him , but with tears , to the severity of the king . '' 
`` Besides , '' interrupted the king , calmed by that supplicating voice , and those persuasive words , `` my parliament will decide .
