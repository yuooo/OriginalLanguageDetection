Sire , we supplicate you , with clasped hands and bended knees , as a divinity is supplicated ! 
Madame Fouquet has no longer any friends , no longer any means of support ; she weeps in her deserted home , abandoned by all those who besieged its doors in the hour of prosperity ; she has neither credit nor hope left . 
At least , the unhappy wretch upon whom your anger falls receives from you , however culpable he may be , his daily bread though moistened by his tears . 
As much afflicted , more destitute than her husband , Madame Fouquet - the lady who had the honor to receive your majesty at her table - Madame Fouquet , the wife of the ancient superintendent of your majesty 's finances , Madame Fouquet has no longer bread . '' 
Here the mortal silence which had chained the breath of Pelisson 's two friends was broken by an outburst of sobs ; and D'Artagnan , whose chest heaved at hearing this humble prayer , turned round towards the angle of the cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan . 
The king had preserved his eye dry and his countenance severe ; but the blood had mounted to his cheeks , and the firmness of his look was visibly diminished . 
`` What do you wish ? '' 
said he , in an agitated voice . 
`` We come humbly to ask your majesty , '' replied Pelisson , upon whom emotion was fast gaining , `` to permit us , without incurring the displeasure of your majesty , to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand pistoles collected among the old friends of her husband , in order that the widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life . '' 
At the word widow , pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still alive , the king turned very pale ; - his pride disappeared ; pity rose from his heart to his lips ; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt sobbing at his feet .
