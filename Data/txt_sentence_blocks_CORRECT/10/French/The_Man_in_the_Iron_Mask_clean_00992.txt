`` Well , yes - living , '' said the captain . 
Then turning towards the Bretons , `` Your lives are safe , my friends ! '' 
cried he , `` all but the Chevalier d'Herblay . '' 
Aramis stared imperceptibly . 
For an instant his eye was fixed upon the depths of the ocean , illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire , which ran along the sides of the waves , played on the crests like plumes , and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they covered . 
`` Do you hear , monseigneur ? '' 
said the sailors . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What are your orders ? '' 
`` Accept ! ''
