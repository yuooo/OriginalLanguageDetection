She lived on them . 
In them she drowned what brains she possessed . 
This had given her , when very young , and even a little later , a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband , a scamp of a certain depth , a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar , coarse and fine at one and the same time , but , so far as sentimentalism was concerned , given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun , and `` in what concerns the sex , '' as he said in his jargon -- a downright , unmitigated lout . 
His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was . 
Later on , when her hair , arranged in a romantically drooping fashion , began to grow gray , when the Magaera began to be developed from the Pamela , the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse , vicious woman , who had dabbled in stupid romances . 
Now , one can not read nonsense with impunity . 
The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine ; as for the younger , the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare ; I know not to what diversion , effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil , she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma . 
However , we will remark by the way , everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding , and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names . 
By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom . 
It is not rare for the neatherd 's boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur , Alfred , or Alphonse , and for the vicomte -- if there are still any vicomtes -- to be called Thomas , Pierre , or Jacques .
