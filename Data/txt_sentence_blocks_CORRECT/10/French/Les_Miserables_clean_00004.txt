He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop , and because he was a bishop . 
But after all , the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only , -- noise , sayings , words ; less than words -- palabres , as the energetic language of the South expresses it . 
However that may be , after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D -- , all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion .
