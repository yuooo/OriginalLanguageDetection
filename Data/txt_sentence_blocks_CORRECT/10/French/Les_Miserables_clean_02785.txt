They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger . 
They had then reached the first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June when , in the barricade Saint-Merry , Jeanne , surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread , replied to all combatants crying : `` Something to eat ! '' 
with : `` Why ? 
It is three o'clock ; at four we shall be dead . '' 
As they could no longer eat , Enjolras forbade them to drink . 
He interdicted wine , and portioned out the brandy . 
They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed . 
Enjolras and Combeferre examined them . 
Combeferre when he came up again said : -- `` It 's the old stock of Father Hucheloup , who began business as a grocer . '' 
-- `` It must be real wine , '' observed Bossuet .
