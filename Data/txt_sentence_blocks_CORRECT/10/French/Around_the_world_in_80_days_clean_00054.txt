`` And you have known your master a long time ? '' 
`` Why , no ; I entered his service the very day we left London . '' 
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . 
The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed Fix in his theory . 
He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in London , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . 
Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez , but was really going on to Bombay . 
`` Is Bombay far from here ? '' 
asked Passepartout . 
`` Pretty far . 
It is a ten days ' voyage by sea . ''
