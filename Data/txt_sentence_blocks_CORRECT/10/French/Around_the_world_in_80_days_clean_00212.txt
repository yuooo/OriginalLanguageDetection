`` But can you sing standing on your head , with a top spinning on your left foot , and a sabre balanced on your right ? '' 
`` Humph ! 
I think so , '' replied Passepartout , recalling the exercises of his younger days . 
`` Well , that 's enough , '' said the Honourable William Batulcar . 
The engagement was concluded there and then . 
Passepartout had at last found something to do . 
He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe . 
It was not a very dignified position , but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco . 
The performance , so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar , was to commence at three o'clock , and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door . 
Passepartout , though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part , was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the `` human pyramid , '' executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou .
