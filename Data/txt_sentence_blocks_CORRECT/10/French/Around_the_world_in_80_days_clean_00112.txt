During the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses . 
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage , on the railway , dressed in European habiliments , and with travellers who were quite strangers to her ! 
Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor , and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed , dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her , and recounting the happy sequel of the venture , the result of Passepartout 's rash idea . 
Mr. Fogg said nothing ; while Passepartout , abashed , kept repeating that `` it was n't worth telling . '' 
Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers , rather with tears than words ; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips . 
Then , as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice , and recalled the dangers which still menaced her , she shuddered with terror . 
Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda 's mind , and offered , in order to reassure her , to escort her to Hong Kong , where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up -- an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted . 
She had , it seems , a Parsee relation , who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong , which is wholly an English city , though on an island on the Chinese coast . 
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares . 
The Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi , which , like Mahomet 's tomb , was once suspended between heaven and earth ; though the Benares of to-day , which the Orientalists call the Athens of India , stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth , Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts , giving an aspect of desolation to the place , as the train entered it .
