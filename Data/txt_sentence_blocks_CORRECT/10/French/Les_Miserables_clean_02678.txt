This tread drew near ; it drew still nearer , and stopped . 
It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street . 
Nothing was to be seen , however , but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads , as fine as needles and almost imperceptible , which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one 's closed eyelids , in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep . 
These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch . 
A pause ensued , as though both sides were waiting . 
All at once , from the depths of this darkness , a voice , which was all the more sinister , since no one was visible , and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking , shouted : -- `` Who goes there ? '' 
At the same time , the click of guns , as they were lowered into position , was heard . 
Enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone : -- `` The French Revolution ! '' 
`` Fire ! '' 
shouted the voice .
