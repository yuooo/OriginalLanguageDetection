Day had dawned once more in her spirit ; all had reappeared . 
She felt an unheard-of joy , and a profound anguish . 
It was he ! 
he who had written ! 
he was there ! 
it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing ! 
While she was forgetful of him , he had found her again ! 
But had she forgotten him ? 
No , never ! 
She was foolish to have thought so for a single moment .
