She caressed him with her smile . 
A banquet had been spread in the dining-room . 
Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy . 
Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy . 
They do not consent to be black . 
The night , yes ; the shadows , no . 
If there is no sun , one must be made . 
The dining-room was full of gay things . 
In the centre , above the white and glittering table , was a Venetian lustre with flat plates , with all sorts of colored birds , blue , violet , red , and green , perched amid the candles ; around the chandelier , girandoles , on the walls , sconces with triple and quintuple branches ; mirrors , silverware , glassware , plate , porcelain , faience , pottery , gold and silversmith 's work , all was sparkling and gay . 
The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets , so that where there was not a light , there was a flower .
