`` What is all that noise ? '' 
said Philippe , turning round towards the door of the second staircase . 
And a voice was heard saying , `` This way , this way ! 
A few steps more , sire ! '' 
`` The voice of M. Fouquet , '' said D'Artagnan , who was standing close to the queen-mother . 
`` Then M. d'Herblay can not be far off , '' added Philippe . 
But he then saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him . 
All eyes were turned towards the door at which M. Fouquet was expected to enter ; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered . 
A terrible cry resounded from all corners of the chamber , a painful cry uttered by the king and all present . 
It is given to but few men , even those whose destiny contains the strangest elements , and accidents the most wonderful , to contemplate such a spectacle similar to that which presented itself in the royal chamber at that moment .
