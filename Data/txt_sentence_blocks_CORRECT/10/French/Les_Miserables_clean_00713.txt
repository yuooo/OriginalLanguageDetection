The humiliation of having , in some slight degree , lost the scent , and of having indulged , for a few moments , in an error with regard to Champmathieu , was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place , and of having for so long cherished a just instinct . 
Javert 's content shone forth in his sovereign attitude . 
The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow . 
All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there . 
Javert was in heaven at that moment . 
Without putting the thing clearly to himself , but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success , he , Javert , personified justice , light , and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil . 
Behind him and around him , at an infinite distance , he had authority , reason , the case judged , the legal conscience , the public prosecution , all the stars ; he was protecting order , he was causing the law to yield up its thunders , he was avenging society , he was lending a helping hand to the absolute , he was standing erect in the midst of a glory . 
There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat . 
Erect , haughty , brilliant , he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel . 
The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist ; happy and indignant , he held his heel upon crime , vice , rebellion , perdition , hell ; he was radiant , he exterminated , he smiled , and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael .
