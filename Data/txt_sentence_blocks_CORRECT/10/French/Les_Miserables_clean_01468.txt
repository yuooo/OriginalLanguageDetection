Marius stepped aside promptly , and the old man took possession of his chair . 
The mass concluded , Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant ; the old man approached him again and said : -- `` I beg your pardon , sir , for having disturbed you a while ago , and for again disturbing you at this moment ; you must have thought me intrusive , and I will explain myself . '' 
`` There is no need of that , Sir , '' said Marius . 
`` Yes ! '' 
went on the old man , `` I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me . 
You see , I am attached to this place . 
It seems to me that the mass is better from here . 
Why ? 
I will tell you . 
It is from this place , that I have watched a poor , brave father come regularly , every two or three months , for the last ten years , since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child , because he was prevented by family arrangements .
