The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole , when half-way up . 
His companions imitated him . 
`` Make your men draw back , '' cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis ; `` let them retire out of hearing . '' 
This order , given by Porthos , was executed immediately . 
Then D'Artagnan , turning towards him who followed him : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we are no longer on board the king 's fleet , where , in virtue of your order , you spoke so arrogantly to me , just now . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the officer , `` I did not speak arrogantly to you ; I simply , but rigorously , obeyed instructions . 
I was commanded to follow you . 
I follow you . 
I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do ; I am in duty bound , accordingly , to overhear your conversations . '' 
D'Artagnan trembled with rage , and Porthos and Aramis , who heard this dialogue , trembled likewise , but with uneasiness and fear .
