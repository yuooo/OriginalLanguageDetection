Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper , and who had not the air of being frightfully poor , would have been equivalent to an order . 
But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire , and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will , was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate . 
She retorted with acrimony : -- `` She must work , since she eats . 
I do n't feed her to do nothing . '' 
`` What is she making ? '' 
went on the stranger , in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter 's shoulders . 
The Thenardier deigned to reply : -- `` Stockings , if you please . 
Stockings for my little girls , who have none , so to speak , and who are absolutely barefoot just now . '' 
The man looked at Cosette 's poor little red feet , and continued : -- `` When will she have finished this pair of stockings ? '' 
`` She has at least three or four good days ' work on them still , the lazy creature ! ''
