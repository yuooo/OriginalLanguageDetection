`` How much more easy , '' thought he , `` it will be to be the brother of that woman than her gallant , if she evinces towards me a coldness that my brother could not have for her , but which is imposed upon me as a duty . '' 
The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen ; his heart - his mind - had just been shaken by so violent a trial , that , in spite of their firm temperament , they would not , perhaps , support another shock . 
Happily the queen did not come . 
Then commenced , on the part of Anne of Austria , a political dissertation upon the welcome M. Fouquet had given to the house of France . 
She mixed up hostilities with compliments addressed to the king , and questions as to his health , with little maternal flatteries and diplomatic artifices . 
`` Well , my son , '' said she , `` are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' said Philippe , `` have the goodness to go and inquire after the queen . '' 
At these words , the first Philippe had pronounced aloud , the slight difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was sensible to maternal ears , and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her son . 
Saint-Aignan left the room , and Philippe continued : `` Madame , I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of , you know I do not - and you have even spoken well of him yourself . '' 
`` That is true ; therefore I only question you on the state of your sentiments with respect to him . ''
