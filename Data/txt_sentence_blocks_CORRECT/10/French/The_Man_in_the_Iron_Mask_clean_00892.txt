D'Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king , and during the confusion that will result from his absence , we will get away , or rather you will get away , Porthos , if there is possibility of flight for only one . '' 
Here Porthos shook his head and replied : `` We will escape together , Aramis , or we will stay together . '' 
`` Thine is a right , a generous heart , '' said Aramis , `` only your melancholy uneasiness affects me . '' 
`` I am not uneasy , '' said Porthos . 
`` Then you are angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you . '' 
`` Then why , my friend , do you put on such a dismal countenance ? ''
