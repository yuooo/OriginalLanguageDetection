This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman , who had simply let it fall from his pocket . 
In the days which followed the finding of this treasure , he only displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart .

`` O modesty ! '' 
said Marius . 
THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY Since we have pronounced the word modesty , and since we conceal nothing , we ought to say that once , nevertheless , in spite of his ecstasies , `` his Ursule '' caused him very serious grief . 
It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk . 
A brisk May breeze was blowing , which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees . 
The father and daughter , arm in arm , had just passed Marius ' bench . 
Marius had risen to his feet behind them , and was following them with his eyes , as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul .
