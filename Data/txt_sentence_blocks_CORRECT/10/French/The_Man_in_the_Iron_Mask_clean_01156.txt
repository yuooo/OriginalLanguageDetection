As for Portugal , of which you and I have spoken , monsieur , I can assure you it will contribute with all its resources to assist the Most Christian King in his war . 
I beg you , Monsieur Colbert , to preserve your friendship and also to believe in my profound attachment , and to lay my respect at the feet of His Most Christian Majesty . 
Signed , `` LE DUC D'ALMEDA . '' 
-LRB- 13 -RRB- Aramis had performed more than he had promised ; it remained to be seen how the king , M. Colbert , and D'Artagnan would be faithful to each other . 
In the spring , as Colbert had predicted , the land army entered on its campaign . 
It preceded , in magnificent order , the court of Louis XIV. , who , setting out on horseback , surrounded by carriages filled with ladies and courtiers , conducted the elite of his kingdom to this sanguinary fete . 
The officers of the army , it is true , had no other music save the artillery of the Dutch forts ; but it was enough for a great number , who found in this war honor , advancement , fortune - or death . 
M. d'Artagnan set out commanding a body of twelve thousand men , cavalry , and infantry , with which he was ordered to take the different places which form knots of that strategic network called La Frise . 
Never was an army conducted more gallantly to an expedition . 
The officers knew that their leader , prudent and skillful as he was brave , would not sacrifice a single man , nor yield an inch of ground without necessity .
