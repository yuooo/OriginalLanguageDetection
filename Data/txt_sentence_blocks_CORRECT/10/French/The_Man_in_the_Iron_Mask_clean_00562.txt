`` You are in error , '' replied Montalais ; `` Louise did love you . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` Not with love , I know ; but she liked you , and you ought to have married her before you set out for London . '' 
Raoul broke into a sinister laugh , which made Montalais shudder . 
`` You tell me that very much at your ease , mademoiselle . 
Do people marry whom they like ? 
You forget that the king then kept for himself as his mistress her of whom we are speaking . '' 
`` Listen , '' said the young woman , pressing the hands of Raoul in her own , `` you were wrong in every way ; a man of your age ought never to leave a woman of hers alone . '' 
`` There is no longer any faith in the world , then , '' said Raoul . 
`` No , vicomte , '' said Montalais , quietly .
