The Bishop made him see light . 
On the following day , when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch , the Bishop was still there . 
He followed him , and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck , side by side with the criminal bound with cords . 
He mounted the tumbril with him , he mounted the scaffold with him . 
The sufferer , who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day , was radiant . 
He felt that his soul was reconciled , and he hoped in God . 
The Bishop embraced him , and at the moment when the knife was about to fall , he said to him : `` God raises from the dead him whom man slays ; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more . 
Pray , believe , enter into life : the Father is there . '' 
When he descended from the scaffold , there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass . 
They did not know which was most worthy of admiration , his pallor or his serenity .
