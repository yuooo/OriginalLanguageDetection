Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately , which caused her to hate the stranger . 
It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects . 
Little as was the space occupied by Cosette , it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own , and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed . 
This woman , like many women of her sort , had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day . 
If she had not had Cosette , it is certain that her daughters , idolized as they were , would have received the whole of it ; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself . 
Her daughters received nothing but caresses . 
Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement . 
The sweet , feeble being , who should not have understood anything of this world or of God , incessantly punished , scolded , ill-used , beaten , and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself , who lived in a ray of dawn ! 
Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette . 
Eponine and Azelma were vicious .
