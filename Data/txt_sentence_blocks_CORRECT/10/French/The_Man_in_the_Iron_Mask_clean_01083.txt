He was feeding his soul with the remembrances the noble visage of the comte brought to his mind in crowds - some blooming and charming as that smile - some dark , dismal , and icy as that visage with its eyes now closed to all eternity . 
All at once the bitter flood which mounted from minute to minute invaded his heart , and swelled his breast almost to bursting . 
Incapable of mastering his emotion , he arose , and tearing himself violently from the chamber where he had just found dead him to whom he came to report the news of the death of Porthos , he uttered sobs so heart-rending that the servants , who seemed only to wait for an explosion of grief , answered to it by their lugubrious clamors , and the dogs of the late comte by their lamentable howlings . 
Grimaud was the only one who did not lift up his voice . 
Even in the paroxysm of his grief he would not have dared to profane the dead , or for the first time disturb the slumber of his master . 
Had not Athos always bidden him be dumb ? 
At daybreak D'Artagnan , who had wandered about the lower hall , biting his fingers to stifle his sighs - D'Artagnan went up once more ; and watching the moments when Grimaud turned his head towards him , he made him a sign to come to him , which the faithful servant obeyed without making more noise than a shadow . 
D'Artagnan went down again , followed by Grimaud ; and when he had gained the vestibule , taking the old man 's hands , `` Grimaud , '' said he , `` I have seen how the father died ; now let me know about the son . '' 
Grimaud drew from his breast a large letter , upon the envelope of which was traced the address of Athos . 
He recognized the writing of M. de Beaufort , broke the seal , and began to read , while walking about in the first steel-chill rays of dawn , in the dark alley of old limes , marked by the still visible footsteps of the comte who had just died .
