One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their hive , enormous , dark bees of violent progress . 
Was it a thicket ? 
Was it a bacchanalia ? 
Was it a fortress ? 
Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings . 
There was something of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something Olympian in that confusion . 
One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair , the rafters of roofs , bits of garret windows with their figured paper , window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon , wrecks of chimneys , cupboards , tables , benches , howling topsyturveydom , and those thousand poverty-stricken things , the very refuse of the mendicant , which contain at the same time fury and nothingness . 
One would have said that it was the tatters of a people , rags of wood , of iron , of bronze , of stone , and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust it there at its door , with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade . 
Blocks resembling headsman 's blocks , dislocated chains , pieces of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets , horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish , amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people . 
The barricade Saint Antoine converted everything into a weapon ; everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence ; it was not combat , it was a paroxysm ; the carbines which defended this redoubt , among which there were some blunderbusses , sent bits of earthenware bones , coat-buttons , even the casters from night-stands , dangerous projectiles on account of the brass .
