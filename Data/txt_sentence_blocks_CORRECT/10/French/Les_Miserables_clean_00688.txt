It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes . 
That was clear . 
The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously , without any further explanation : the whole crowd , as by a sort of electric revelation , understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead . 
The details , the hesitations , little possible oppositions , were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact . 
It was an impression which vanished speedily , but which was irresistible at the moment . 
`` I do not wish to disturb the court further , '' resumed Jean Valjean . 
`` I shall withdraw , since you do not arrest me . 
I have many things to do . 
The district-attorney knows who I am ; he knows whither I am going ; he can have me arrested when he likes . '' 
He directed his steps towards the door .
