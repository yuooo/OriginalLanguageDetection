`` Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , '' replied Colonel Proctor , in an insolent tone . 
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , `` You do n't understand anything about whist . '' 
`` Perhaps I do , as well as another , '' said Phileas Fogg , rising . 
`` You have only to try , son of John Bull , '' replied the colonel . 
Aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold . 
She seized Mr. Fogg 's arm and gently pulled him back . 
Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American , who was staring insolently at his opponent . 
But Fix got up , and , going to Colonel Proctor said , `` You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only . 
The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . ''
