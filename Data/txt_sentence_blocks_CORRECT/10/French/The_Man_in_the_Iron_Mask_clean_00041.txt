`` At least I know who his successor was . '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` By means of a coin dated 1610 , which bears the effigy of Henry IV. ; and another of 1612 , bearing that of Louis XIII . 
So I presumed that , there being only two years between the two dates , Louis was Henry 's successor . '' 
`` Then , '' said Aramis , `` you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis XIII . ? '' 
`` I do , '' answered the youth , slightly reddening . 
`` Well , he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects , always , alas ! 
deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that his minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of France . 
The king himself was of a feeble character , and died young and unhappy . '' 
`` I know it . ''
