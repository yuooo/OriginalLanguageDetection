With him sank the rock , which , even in his dying agony he had still held up . 
The three men dropped the levers , which rolled upon the tumulary stone . 
Then , breathless , pale , his brow covered with sweat , Aramis listened , his breast oppressed , his heart ready to break . 
Nothing more . 
The giant slept the eternal sleep , in the sepulcher which God had built about him to his measure . 
: Porthos 's Epitaph . 
Aramis , silent and sad as ice , trembling like a timid child , arose shivering from the stone . 
A Christian does not walk on tombs . 
But , though capable of standing , he was not capable of walking . 
It might be said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him .
