To whom is this accorded ? 
There must be elections for this in heaven ; we are all candidates , unknown to ourselves ; the angels vote . 
Cosette and Marius had been elected . 
Cosette , both at the mayor 's office and at church , was dazzling and touching . 
Toussaint , assisted by Nicolette , had dressed her . 
Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta , her robe of Binche guipure , a veil of English point , a necklace of fine pearls , a wreath of orange flowers ; all this was white , and , from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth . 
It was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light . 
One would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess . 
Marius ' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed ; here and there , beneath the thick curls , pale lines -- the scars of the barricade -- were visible . 
The grandfather , haughty , with head held high , amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of Barras , escorted Cosette .
