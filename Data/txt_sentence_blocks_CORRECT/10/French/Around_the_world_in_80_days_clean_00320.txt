As for Captain Speedy , he continued to howl and growl in his cabin ; and Passepartout , whose duty it was to carry him his meals , courageous as he was , took the greatest precautions . 
Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board . 
On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . 
Ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south-east . 
This was a misfortune . 
Mr. Fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . 
She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . 
The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves . 
Passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . 
But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam .
