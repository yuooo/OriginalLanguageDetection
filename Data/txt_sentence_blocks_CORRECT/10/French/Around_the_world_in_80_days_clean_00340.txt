There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings , and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club . 
So great had been the expense of his tour that , even had he won , it would not have enriched him ; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself , being a man who rather laid wagers for honour 's sake than for the stake proposed . 
But this wager totally ruined him . 
Mr. Fogg 's course , however , was fully decided upon ; he knew what remained for him to do . 
A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda , who was overwhelmed with grief at her protector 's misfortune . 
From the words which Mr. Fogg dropped , she saw that he was meditating some serious project . 
Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing . 
First of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days . 
He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear . 
The night passed .
