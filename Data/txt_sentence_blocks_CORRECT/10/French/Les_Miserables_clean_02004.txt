`` It was murmured by all who were there , '' to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present . 
The exaltation was such that one day , a workingman exclaimed , efore the whole wine-shop : `` We have no arms ! '' 
One of his comrades replied : `` The soldiers have ! '' 
thus parodying without being aware of the fact , Bonaparte 's proclamation to the army in Italy : `` When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand , '' adds one report , `` they did not communicate it to each other . '' 
It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said . 
These reunions were sometimes periodical . 
At certain ones of them , there were never more than eight or ten persons present , and they were always the same . 
In others , any one entered who wished , and the room was so full that they were forced to stand . 
Some went thither through enthusiasm and passion ; others because it was on their way to their work . 
As during the Revolution , there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops who embraced new-comers .
