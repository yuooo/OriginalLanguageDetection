Porthos , placing his back against the neighboring rock , made an arch with his foot , which drove the block out of the calcareous masses which served for hinges and cramps . 
The stone fell , and daylight was visible , brilliant , radiant , flooding the cavern through the opening , and the blue sea appeared to the delighted Bretons . 
They began to lift the bark over the barricade . 
Twenty more toises , and it would glide into the ocean . 
It was during this time that the company arrived , was drawn up by the captain , and disposed for either an escalade or an assault . 
Aramis watched over everything , to favor the labors of his friends . 
He saw the reinforcements , counted the men , and convinced himself at a single glance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would expose them . 
To escape by sea , at the moment the cavern was about to be invaded , was impossible . 
In fact , the daylight which had just been admitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark being rolled towards the sea , the two rebels within musket-shot ; and one of their discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the navigators . 
Besides , allowing everything , - if the bark escaped with the men on board of it , how could the alarm be suppressed - how could notice to the royal lighters be prevented ?
