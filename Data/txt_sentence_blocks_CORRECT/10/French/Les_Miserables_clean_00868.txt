`` Let us put him to the wine test , '' said Thenardier . 
They made an effort , and got the old road-mender to drinking . 
Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount , but said very little . 
He combined with admirable art , and in masterly proportions , the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge . 
Nevertheless , by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him , this is what Thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out : -- One morning , when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work , at daybreak , he had been surprised to see , at a nook of the forest in the underbrush , a shovel and a pickaxe , concealed , as one might say . 
However , he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours , the water-carrier , and would have thought no more about it . 
But , on the evening of that day , he saw , without being seen himself , as he was hidden by a large tree , `` a person who did not belong in those parts , and whom he , Boulatruelle , knew well , '' directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood . 
Translation by Thenardier : A comrade of the galleys . 
Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name . 
This person carried a package -- something square , like a large box or a small trunk .
