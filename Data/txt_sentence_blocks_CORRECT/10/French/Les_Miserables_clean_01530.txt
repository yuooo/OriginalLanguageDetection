But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly that poor de , that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it . 
M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin ; M. de Caumartin , M. Caumartin ; M. de Constant de Robecque , Benjamin Constant ; M. de Lafayette , M. Lafayette . 
Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest , and called himself plain Courfeyrac . 
We might almost , so far as Courfeyrac is concerned , stop here , and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains : `` For Courfeyrac , see Tholomyes . '' 
Courfeyrac had , in fact , that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind . 
Later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws . 
This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools , who pass it from hand to hand , quasi cursores , and is almost always exactly the same ; so that , as we have just pointed out , any one who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyes in 1817 . 
Only , Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow . 
Beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind , the difference between him and Tholomyes was very great . 
The latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second .
