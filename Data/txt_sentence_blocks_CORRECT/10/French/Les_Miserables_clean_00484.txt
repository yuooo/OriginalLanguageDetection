Here is the true state of the case : I was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away ; there were still groups of people standing about , and I made inquiries and learned everything ; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police . '' 
Javert retorted : -- `` This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire . '' 
`` That concerns me , '' said M. Madeleine . 
`` My own insult belongs to me , I think . 
I can do what I please about it . '' 
`` I beg Monsieur le Maire 's pardon . 
The insult is not to him but to the law . '' 
`` Inspector Javert , '' replied M. Madeleine , `` the highest law is conscience . 
I have heard this woman ; I know what I am doing . '' 
`` And I , Mr. Mayor , do not know what I see . ''
