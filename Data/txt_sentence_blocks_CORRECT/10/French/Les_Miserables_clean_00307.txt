FOUR AND FOUR It is hard nowadays to picture to one 's self what a pleasure-trip of students and grisettes to the country was like , forty-five years ago . 
The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same ; the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last half-century ; where there was the cuckoo , there is the railway car ; where there was a tender-boat , there is now the steamboat ; people speak of Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days . 
The Paris of 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts . 
The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time . 
The vacation was beginning , and it was a warm , bright , summer day . 
On the preceding day , Favourite , the only one who knew how to write , had written the following to Tholomyes in the name of the four : `` It is a good hour to emerge from happiness . '' 
That is why they rose at five o'clock in the morning . 
Then they went to Saint-Cloud by the coach , looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed , `` This must be very beautiful when there is water ! '' 
They breakfasted at the Tete-Noir , where Castaing had not yet been ; they treated themselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain ; they ascended Diogenes ' lantern , they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sevres , picked bouquets at Pateaux , bought reed-pipes at Neuilly , ate apple tarts everywhere , and were perfectly happy . 
The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage .
