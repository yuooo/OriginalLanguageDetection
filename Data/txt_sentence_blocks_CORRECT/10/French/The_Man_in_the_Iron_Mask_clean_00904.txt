`` Yes , let us interrogate the prisoner , '' said Porthos , `` and the means of making him speak are very simple . 
We are going to supper ; we will invite him to join us ; as he drinks he will talk . '' 
This was done . 
The officer was at first rather uneasy , but became reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with . 
He gave , without having any fear of compromising himself , all the details imaginable of the resignation and departure of D'Artagnan . 
He explained how , after that departure , the new leader of the expedition had ordered a surprise upon Belle-Isle . 
There his explanations stopped . 
Aramis and Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair . 
No more dependence to be placed now on D'Artagnan 's fertile imagination - no further resource in the event of defeat . 
Aramis , continuing his interrogations , asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle .
