`` Go along with you ! '' 
repeated Javert . 
And he added : `` There will be a funeral here to-morrow . '' 
For Javert , the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically classed , which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance , and each contingency had its own compartment ; all possible facts were arranged in drawers , as it were , whence they emerged on occasion , in variable quantities ; in the street , uproar , revolt , carnival , and funeral . 
The porter contented himself with waking Basque . 
Basque woke Nicolette ; Nicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand . 
As for the grandfather , they let him sleep on , thinking that he would hear about the matter early enough in any case . 
Marius was carried up to the first floor , without any one in the other parts of the house being aware of the fact , and deposited on an old sofa in M. Gillenormand 's antechamber ; and while Basque went in search of a physician , and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses , Jean Valjean felt Javert touch him on the shoulder . 
He understood and descended the stairs , having behind him the step of Javert who was following him . 
The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their arrival , in terrified somnolence .
