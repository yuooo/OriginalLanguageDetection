It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done , after the mayor 's suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty . 
Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor 's presence ? 
Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any `` authority '' should have given such an order , and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another , without intending it ? 
Or , in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours , did he say to himself , that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions , that it was indispensable that the small should be made great , that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate , that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice , and that , in this prodigious extremity , order , law , morality , government , society in its entirety , was personified in him , Javert ? 
However that may be , when M. Madeleine uttered that word , I , as we have just heard , Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor , pale , cold , with blue lips , and a look of despair , his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence , and say to him , with downcast eyes but a firm voice : -- `` Mr. Mayor , that can not be . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
said M. Madeleine . 
`` This miserable woman has insulted a citizen . '' 
`` Inspector Javert , '' replied the mayor , in a calm and conciliating tone , `` listen . 
You are an honest man , and I feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you .
