`` At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow ? '' 
`` About three o'clock in the afternoon . 
The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall . 
It is not very near . '' 
`` I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the morning . 
And how about food ? 
I shall be hungry . '' 
`` I will bring you something . '' 
`` You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock . '' 
Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints .
