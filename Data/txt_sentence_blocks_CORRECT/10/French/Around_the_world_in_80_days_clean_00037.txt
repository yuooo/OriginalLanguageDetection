`` No , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul . 
`` She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said , and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft . 
I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company 's regulations , and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed . '' 
`` Does she come directly from Brindisi ? '' 
`` Directly from Brindisi ; she takes on the Indian mails there , and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience , Mr. Fix ; she will not be late . 
But really , I do n't see how , from the description you have , you will be able to recognise your man , even if he is on board the Mongolia . '' 
`` A man rather feels the presence of these fellows , consul , than recognises them . 
You must have a scent for them , and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing , seeing , and smelling . 
I 've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , I 'll answer for it ; he 'll not slip through my fingers . '' 
`` I hope so , Mr. Fix , for it was a heavy robbery . ''
