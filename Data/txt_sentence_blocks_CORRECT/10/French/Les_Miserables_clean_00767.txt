A detail to be noted . 
There was in the English infantry , particularly in Kempt 's brigade , a great many raw recruits . 
These young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry ; their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma ; they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers : the soldier skirmisher , left somewhat to himself , becomes , so to speak , his own general . 
These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and fury . 
This novice of an infantry had dash . 
This displeased Wellington . 
After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered . 
There is in this day an obscure interval , from mid-day to four o'clock ; the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct , and participates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict . 
Twilight reigns over it . 
We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog , a dizzy mirage , paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day , pendant colbacks , floating sabre-taches , cross-belts , cartridge-boxes for grenades , hussar dolmans , red boots with a thousand wrinkles , heavy shakos garlanded with torsades , the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of England , the English soldiers with great , white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets , the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather , with brass hands and red horse-tails , the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids , the great white gaiters of our grenadiers ; pictures , not strategic lines -- what Salvator Rosa requires , not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval .
