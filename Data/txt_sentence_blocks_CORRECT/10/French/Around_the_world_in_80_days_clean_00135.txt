But , Monsieur Fix , you do n't know that we have a young lady with us . '' 
`` A young lady ? '' 
replied the detective , not seeming to comprehend what was said . 
Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda 's history , the affair at the Bombay pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the Calcutta court , and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail . 
Fix , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related ; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener . 
`` But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives , a rich merchant at Hong Kong . '' 
`` Nothing to be done there , '' said Fix to himself , concealing his disappointment . 
`` A glass of gin , Mr. Passepartout ? ''
