You can take me , for here I am : but I have done my best ; I concealed myself under another name ; I have become rich ; I have become a mayor ; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest . 
It seems that that is not to be done . 
In short , there are many things which I can not tell . 
I will not narrate the story of my life to you ; you will hear it one of these days . 
I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop , it is true ; it is true that I robbed Little Gervais ; they were right in telling you that Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch . 
Perhaps it was not altogether his fault . 
Listen , honorable judges ! 
a man who has been so greatly humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence , nor any advice to give to society ; but , you see , the infamy from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing ; the galleys make the convict what he is ; reflect upon that , if you please . 
Before going to the galleys , I was a poor peasant , with very little intelligence , a sort of idiot ; the galleys wrought a change in me . 
I was stupid ; I became vicious : I was a block of wood ; I became a firebrand .
