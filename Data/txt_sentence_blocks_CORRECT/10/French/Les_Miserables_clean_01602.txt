There are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate , which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes . 
Noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds , which are requited with no renown , which are saluted with no trumpet blast . 
Life , misfortune , isolation , abandonment , poverty , are the fields of battle which have their heroes ; obscure heroes , who are , sometimes , grander than the heroes who win renown . 
Firm and rare natures are thus created ; misery , almost always a step-mother , is sometimes a mother ; destitution gives birth to might of soul and spirit ; distress is the nurse of pride ; unhappiness is a good milk for the magnanimous . 
There came a moment in Marius ' life , when he swept his own landing , when he bought his sou 's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer 's , when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker 's and purchase a loaf , which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it . 
Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher 's shop on the corner , in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him , an awkward young man , carrying big books under his arm , who had a timid yet angry air , who , on entering , removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration , made a profound bow to the butcher 's astonished wife , asked for a mutton cutlet , paid six or seven sous for it , wrapped it up in a paper , put it under his arm , between two books , and went away . 
It was Marius . 
On this cutlet , which he cooked for himself , he lived for three days . 
On the first day he ate the meat , on the second he ate the fat , on the third he gnawed the bone . 
Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts , and sent him the sixty pistoles several times .
