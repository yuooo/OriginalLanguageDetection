And then , there is the affair with the little Savoyard , who will return , I hope . 
The deuce ! 
there is plenty to dispute in the matter , is there not ? 
Yes , for any one but Jean Valjean . 
But Jean Valjean is a sly dog . 
That is the way I recognized him . 
Any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him ; he would struggle , he would cry out -- the kettle sings before the fire ; he would not be Jean Valjean , et cetera . 
But he has not the appearance of understanding ; he says , ` I am Champmathieu , and I wo n't depart from that ! ' 
He has an astonished air , he pretends to be stupid ; it is far better . 
Oh !
