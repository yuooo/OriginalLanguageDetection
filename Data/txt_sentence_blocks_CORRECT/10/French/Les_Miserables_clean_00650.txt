He retired with bowed head , traversed the antechamber , and slowly descended the stairs , as though hesitating at every step . 
It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself . 
The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended ; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it . 
On reaching the landing-place , he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms . 
All at once he opened his coat , drew out his pocket-book , took from it a pencil , tore out a leaf , and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly , by the light of the street lantern , this line : M. Madeleine , Mayor of M. sur M. ; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides , made his way through the crowd , walked straight up to the usher , handed him the paper , and said in an authoritative manner : -- `` Take this to Monsieur le President . '' 
The usher took the paper , cast a glance upon it , and obeyed . 
AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR Although he did not suspect the fact , the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a sort of celebrity . 
For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais ; it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments . 
Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry , there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some benefit . 
He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements .
