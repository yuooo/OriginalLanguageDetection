Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion , but it is certain that Caesar laughed . 
While exploring on horseback at one o'clock on the preceding night , in storm and rain , in company with Bertrand , the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme , satisfied at the sight of the long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from Frischemont to Braine-l'Alleud , it had seemed to him that fate , to whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo , was exact to the appointment ; he stopped his horse , and remained for some time motionless , gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder ; and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying , `` We are in accord . '' 
Napoleon was mistaken . 
They were no longer in accord . 
He took not a moment for sleep ; every instant of that night was marked by a joy for him . 
He traversed the line of the principal outposts , halting here and there to talk to the sentinels . 
At half-past two , near the wood of Hougomont , he heard the tread of a column on the march ; he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington . 
He said : `` It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the purpose of decamping . 
I will take prisoners the six thousand English who have just arrived at Ostend . '' 
He conversed expansively ; he regained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March , when he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf Juan , and cried , `` Well , Bertrand , here is a reinforcement already ! ''
