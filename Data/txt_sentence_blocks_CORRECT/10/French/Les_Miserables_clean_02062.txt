To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime . 
They are artists , who have one picture in the salon , and who toil , none the less , on a new work in their studios . 
Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison . 
He could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the sutler 's window in the Charlemagne yard , staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with : garlic , 62 centimes , and ended with : cigar , 5 centimes . 
Or he passed his time in trembling , chattering his teeth , saying that he had a fever , and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant . 
All at once , towards the end of February , 1832 , it was discovered that Brujon , that somnolent fellow , had had three different commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment , not under his own name , but in the name of three of his comrades ; and they had cost him in all fifty sous , an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal . 
Inquiries were instituted , and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the convict 's parlor , it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows : three commissions ; one to the Pantheon , ten sous ; one to Val-de-Grace , fifteen sous ; and one to the Barriere de Grenelle , twenty-five sous . 
This last was the dearest of the whole tariff . 
Now , at the Pantheon , at the Val-de-Grace , and at the Barriere de Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers , Kruideniers , alias Bizarre , Glorieux , an ex-convict , and Barre-Carosse , upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident . 
It was thought that these men were members of Patron Minette ; two of those leaders , Babet and Gueulemer , had been captured .
