But it was because I wanted to die before you . 
When I received that bullet , I dragged myself here , no one saw me , no one picked me up , I was waiting for you , I said : ` So he is not coming ! ' 
Oh , if you only knew . 
I bit my blouse , I suffered so ! 
Now I am well . 
Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked at myself in your mirror , and the day when I came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen ? 
How the birds sang ! 
That was a long time ago . 
You gave me a hundred sous , and I said to you : ` I do n't want your money . ' 
I hope you picked up your coin ?
