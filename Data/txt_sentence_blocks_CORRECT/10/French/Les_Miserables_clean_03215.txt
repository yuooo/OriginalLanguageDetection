A pile of Cassandras , Harlequins and Columbines , jolted along high above the passers-by , all possible grotesquenesses , from the Turk to the savage , Hercules supporting Marquises , fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears just as the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his eyes , tow wigs , pink tights , dandified hats , spectacles of a grimacer , three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly , shouts directed at pedestrians , fists on hips , bold attitudes , bare shoulders , immodesty unchained ; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers ; this is what that institution was like . 
Greece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis , France stands in need of the hackney-coach of Vade . 
Everything can be parodied , even parody . 
The Saturnalia , that grimace of antique beauty , ends , through exaggeration after exaggeration , in Shrove Tuesday ; and the Bacchanal , formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves and grapes , inundated with sunshine , displaying her marble breast in a divine semi-nudity , having at the present day lost her shape under the soaked rags of the North , has finally come to be called the Jack-pudding . 
The tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy . 
The accounts of Louis XI . 
allot to the bailiff of the palace `` twenty sous , Tournois , for three coaches of mascarades in the cross-roads . '' 
In our day , these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage , whose imperial they load down , or they overwhelm a hired landau , with its top thrown back , with their tumultuous groups . 
Twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six . 
They cling to the seats , to the rumble , on the cheeks of the hood , on the shafts .
