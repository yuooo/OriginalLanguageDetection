Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time . 
As for the Bishop , his thought can be found explained , or at least indicated , in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible , `` This is the shade of difference : the door of the physician should never be shut , the door of the priest should always be open . '' 
On another book , entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science , he had written this other note : `` Am not I a physician like them ? 
I also have my patients , and then , too , I have some whom I call my unfortunates . '' 
Again he wrote : `` Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you . 
The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter . '' 
It chanced that a worthy cure , I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry , took it into his head to ask him one day , probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire , whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion , to a certain extent , in leaving his door unfastened day and night , at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter , and whether , in short , he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded . 
The Bishop touched his shoulder , with gentle gravity , and said to him , `` Nisi Dominus custodierit domum , in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam , '' Unless the Lord guard the house , in vain do they watch who guard it . 
Then he spoke of something else . 
He was fond of saying , `` There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons , -- only , '' he added , `` ours must be tranquil . ''
