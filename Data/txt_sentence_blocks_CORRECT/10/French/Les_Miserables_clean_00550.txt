At the moment when that name , which he had buried beneath so many layers , was so strangely articulated , he was struck with stupor , and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny ; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks . 
He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm , like a soldier at the approach of an assault . 
He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head . 
As he listened to Javert , the first thought which occurred to him was to go , to run and denounce himself , to take that Champmathieu out of prison and place himself there ; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh . 
Then it passed away , and he said to himself , `` We will see ! 
We will see ! '' 
He repressed this first , generous instinct , and recoiled before heroism . 
It would be beautiful , no doubt , after the Bishop 's holy words , after so many years of repentance and abnegation , in the midst of a penitence admirably begun , if this man had not flinched for an instant , even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture , but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice , at the bottom of which lay heaven ; that would have been beautiful ; but it was not thus . 
We must render an account of the things which went on in this soul , and we can only tell what there was there . 
He was carried away , at first , by the instinct of self-preservation ; he rallied all his ideas in haste , stifled his emotions , took into consideration Javert 's presence , that great danger , postponed all decision with the firmness of terror , shook off thought as to what he had to do , and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler .
