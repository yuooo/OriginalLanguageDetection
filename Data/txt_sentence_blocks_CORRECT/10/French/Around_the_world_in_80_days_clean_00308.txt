At last the Hudson came into view ; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the Cunard line . 
The China , for Liverpool , had started three-quarters of an hour before ! 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGES IN A DIRECT STRUGGLE WITH BAD FORTUNE The China , in leaving , seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg 's last hope . 
None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects . 
The Pereire , of the French Transatlantic Company , whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort , did not leave until the 14th ; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London , but to Havre ; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg 's last efforts of no avail . 
The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day , and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager . 
Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw , which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers . 
Passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour . 
It was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! 
And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin Mr. Fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations .
