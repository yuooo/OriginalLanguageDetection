`` What do they do ? '' 
`` They weep . '' 
`` Let them come in , '' said the king , with a serious brow . 
D'Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel , raised the tapestry which closed the entrance to the royal chamber , and directing his voice to the adjoining room , cried , `` Enter . '' 
The three men D'Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of the cabinet in which were the king and his captain . 
A profound silence prevailed in their passage . 
The courtiers , at the approach of the friends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances , drew back , as if fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune . 
D'Artagnan , with a quick step , came forward to take by the hand the unhappy men who stood trembling at the door of the cabinet ; he led them in front of the king 's fauteuil , who , having placed himself in the embrasure of a window , awaited the moment of presentation , and was preparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic reception . 
The first of the friends of Fouquet 's to advance was Pelisson . 
He did not weep , but his tears were only restrained that the king might better hear his voice and prayer .
