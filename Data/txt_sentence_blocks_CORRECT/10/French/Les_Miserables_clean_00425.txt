cried the old man . 
Madeleine raised his head , met Javert 's falcon eye still fixed upon him , looked at the motionless peasants , and smiled sadly . 
Then , without saying a word , he fell on his knees , and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry , he was underneath the vehicle . 
A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued . 
They beheld Madeleine , almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight , make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together . 
They shouted to him , `` Father Madeleine , come out ! '' 
Old Fauchelevent himself said to him , `` Monsieur Madeleine , go away ! 
You see that I am fated to die ! 
Leave me ! 
You will get yourself crushed also ! ''
