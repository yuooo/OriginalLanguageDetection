`` What difference is it to you ? 
Do you know Plum Creek ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the next station . 
The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes . 
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I will stop at Plum Creek . '' 
`` And I guess you 'll stay there too , '' added the American insolently . 
`` Who knows ? ''
