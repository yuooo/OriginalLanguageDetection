You remember her blue plush hat . 
Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides , where there was a railing on a garden , the Rue Plumet . 
I lived in a little back court-yard , whence I could hear her piano . 
That was my life . 
We never left each other . 
That lasted for nine years and some months . 
I was like her own father , and she was my child . 
I do not know whether you understand , Monsieur Pontmercy , but to go away now , never to see her again , never to speak to her again , to no longer have anything , would be hard . 
If you do not disapprove of it , I will come to see Cosette from time to time . 
I will not come often .
