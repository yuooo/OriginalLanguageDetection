`` Certainly . '' 
Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat ; but , though he was really on the Carnatic , his master was not there . 
He fell thunderstruck on a seat . 
He saw it all now . 
He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed , that he should have informed his master of that fact , and that he had not done so . 
It was his fault , then , that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer . 
Yes , but it was still more the fault of the traitor who , in order to separate him from his master , and detain the latter at Hong Kong , had inveigled him into getting drunk ! 
He now saw the detective 's trick ; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined , his bet was lost , and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned ! 
At this thought Passepartout tore his hair . 
Ah , if Fix ever came within his reach , what a settling of accounts there would be !
