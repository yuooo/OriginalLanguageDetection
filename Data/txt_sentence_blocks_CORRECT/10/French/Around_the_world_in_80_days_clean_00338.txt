He had only received his deserts . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout left the Custom House without delay , got into a cab , and in a few moments descended at the station . 
Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for London . 
It was forty minutes past two . 
The express train had left thirty-five minutes before . 
Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train . 
There were several rapid locomotives on hand ; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock . 
At that hour Phileas Fogg , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards London with Aouda and his faithful servant . 
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout . 
But there were forced delays , and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine . ''
