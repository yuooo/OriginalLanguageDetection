When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less , that he was convalescing , and that he appeared to be happy , she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive , so gently and naturally had it come . 
Then , it was in the month of March , the days were growing longer , the winter was departing , the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness ; then came April , that daybreak of summer , fresh as dawn always is , gay like every childhood ; a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it is . 
In that month , nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky , from the trees , from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man . 
Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that April joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself . 
Insensibly , and without her suspecting the fact , the blackness departed from her spirit . 
In spring , sad souls grow light , as light falls into cellars at midday . 
Cosette was no longer sad . 
However , though this was so , she did not account for it to herself . 
In the morning , about ten o'clock , after breakfast , when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour , and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps , supporting his left arm for him , she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy . 
Jean Valjean , intoxicated , beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more .
