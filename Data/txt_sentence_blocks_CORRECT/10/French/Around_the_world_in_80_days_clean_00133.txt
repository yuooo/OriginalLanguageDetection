Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities , and signal the Rangoon before her arrival . 
This was easy to do , since the steamer stopped at Singapore , whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong . 
He finally resolved , moreover , before acting more positively , to question Passepartout . 
It would not be difficult to make him talk ; and , as there was no time to lose , Fix prepared to make himself known . 
It was now the 30th of October , and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore . 
Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck . 
Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer . 
The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise , and exclaimed , `` You here , on the Rangoon ? '' 
`` What , Monsieur Fix , are you on board ? '' 
returned the really astonished Passepartout , recognising his crony of the Mongolia .
