`` Monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert , turning pale . 
`` Monsieur , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` the king alone , understand , - the king alone has a right to command my musketeers ; but , as to you , I forbid you to do it , and I tell you so before his majesty ; gentlemen who carry swords do not sling pens behind their ears . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! 
D'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` It is humiliating , '' continued the musketeer ; `` my soldiers are disgraced . 
I do not command reitres , thank you , nor clerks of the intendant , mordioux ! '' 
`` Well ! 
but what is all this about ? ''
