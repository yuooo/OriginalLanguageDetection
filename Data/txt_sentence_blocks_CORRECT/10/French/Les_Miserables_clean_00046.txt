This was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted . 
He said , `` That takes nothing from the poor . '' 
It must be confessed , however , that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle , which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight , as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth . 
And since we are now painting the Bishop of D -- as he was in reality , we must add that he had said more than once , `` I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes . '' 
To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver , which he had inherited from a great-aunt . 
These candlesticks held two wax candles , and usually figured on the Bishop 's chimney-piece . 
When he had any one to dinner , Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table . 
In the Bishop 's own chamber , at the head of his bed , there was a small cupboard , in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night . 
But it is necessary to add , that the key was never removed . 
The garden , which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned , was composed of four alleys in cross-form , radiating from a tank .
