`` Then I will never write anything again save in prose , '' said La Fontaine , who had taken up Pelisson 's reproach in earnest . 
`` Ah !

Yes , 't is the very truth . '' 
`` Do not say so ; your remark is too sweeping , and there is much that is good in your ` Fables . ' '' 
`` And to begin , '' continued La Fontaine , following up his idea , `` I will go and burn a hundred verses I have just made . '' 
`` Where are your verses ? '' 
`` In my head . ''
