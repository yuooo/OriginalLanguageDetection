Cosette , dost thou remember Montfermeil ? 
Thou wert in the forest , thou wert greatly terrified ; dost thou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket ? 
That was the first time that I touched thy poor , little hand . 
It was so cold ! 
Ah ! 
your hands were red then , mademoiselle , they are very white now . 
And the big doll ! 
dost thou remember ? 
Thou didst call her Catherine . 
Thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent !
