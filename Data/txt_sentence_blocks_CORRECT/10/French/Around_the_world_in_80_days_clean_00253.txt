While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause . 
Several passengers had got off at Green River , and were walking up and down the platforms ; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor , the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting . 
Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery . 
She was attached to the man who , however coldly , gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion . 
She did not comprehend , perhaps , the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her , which she called gratitude , but which , though she was unconscious of it , was really more than that . 
Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired , sooner or later , to call to account for his conduct . 
Chance alone , it was clear , had brought Colonel Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary . 
Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen . 
`` That Proctor on this train ! ''
