It was a fumbling and uneasy flight , -- a mole 's track , whose branchings are untraceable . 
Later on , some trace of his passage into Ain , in the territory of Civrieux , was discovered ; in the Pyrenees , at Accons ; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec , near the market of Chavailles , and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies , canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet . 
He reached Paris . 
We have just seen him at Montfermeil . 
His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age ; then to procure a lodging . 
That done , he had betaken himself to Montfermeil . 
It will be remembered that already , during his preceding escape , he had made a mysterious trip thither , or somewhere in that neighborhood , of which the law had gathered an inkling . 
However , he was thought to be dead , and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him . 
At Paris , one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands . 
He felt reassured and almost at peace , as though he had really been dead .
