Eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man , the mysterious Being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand , while the olive-trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite , the terrible cup which appeared to Him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars . 
FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP Three o'clock in the morning had just struck , and he had been walking thus for five hours , almost uninterruptedly , when he at length allowed himself to drop into his chair . 
There he fell asleep and had a dream . 
This dream , like the majority of dreams , bore no relation to the situation , except by its painful and heart-rending character , but it made an impression on him . 
This nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on . 
It is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us . 
We think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text . 
Of whatever nature this dream may be , the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it : it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul . 
Here it is . 
On the envelope we find this line inscribed , `` The Dream I had that Night . ''
