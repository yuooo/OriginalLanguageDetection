Out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole , which he desired to present to souls . 
At eight o'clock he was still at work , writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper , with a big book open on his knees , when Madame Magloire entered , according to her wont , to get the silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed . 
A moment later , the Bishop , knowing that the table was set , and that his sister was probably waiting for him , shut his book , rose from his table , and entered the dining-room . 
The dining-room was an oblong apartment , with a fireplace , which had a door opening on the street -LRB- as we have said -RRB- , and a window opening on the garden . 
Madame Magloire was , in fact , just putting the last touches to the table . 
As she performed this service , she was conversing with Mademoiselle Baptistine . 
A lamp stood on the table ; the table was near the fireplace . 
A wood fire was burning there . 
One can easily picture to one 's self these two women , both of whom were over sixty years of age . 
Madame Magloire small , plump , vivacious ; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle , slender , frail , somewhat taller than her brother , dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk , of the fashion of 1806 , which she had purchased at that date in Paris , and which had lasted ever since .
