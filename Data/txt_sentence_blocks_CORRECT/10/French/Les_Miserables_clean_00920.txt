His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe , and which was humble . 
There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity . 
In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief ; in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel , cut from some hedge . 
This stick had been carefully trimmed , and had an air that was not too threatening ; the most had been made of its knots , and it had received a coral-like head , made from red wax : it was a cudgel , and it seemed to be a cane . 
There are but few passers-by on that boulevard , particularly in the winter . 
The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them , but this without any affectation . 
At that epoch , King Louis XVIII . 
went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi : it was one of his favorite excursions . 
Towards two o'clock , almost invariably , the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l'Hopital . 
This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said , `` It is two o'clock ; there he is returning to the Tuileries . ''
