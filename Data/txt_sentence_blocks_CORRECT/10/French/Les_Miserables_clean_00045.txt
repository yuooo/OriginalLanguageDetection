At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff , which finally became so old , that , in order to avoid the expense of a new one , Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it . 
This seam took the form of a cross . 
The Bishop often called attention to it : `` How delightful that is ! '' 
he said . 
All the rooms in the house , without exception , those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor , were white-washed , which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals . 
However , in their latter years , Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over , paintings , ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine , as we shall see further on . 
Before becoming a hospital , this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois . 
Hence this decoration . 
The chambers were paved in red bricks , which were washed every week , with straw mats in front of all the beds . 
Altogether , this dwelling , which was attended to by the two women , was exquisitely clean from top to bottom .
