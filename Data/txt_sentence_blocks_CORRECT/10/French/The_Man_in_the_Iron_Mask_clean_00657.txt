The moon , rising behind the rocks , unrolled a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea . 
In the roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to facilitate the embarkation . 
The sea , loaded with phosphoric light , opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and munitions ; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames ; from every oar dropped liquid diamonds . 
The sailors , rejoicing in the largesses of the admiral , were heard murmuring their slow and artless songs . 
Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot falling into the holds . 
Such harmonies , such a spectacle , oppress the heart like fear , and dilate it like hope . 
All this life speaks of death . 
Athos had seated himself with his son , upon the moss , among the brambles of the promontory . 
Around their heads passed and repassed large bats , carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind chase . 
The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff , bathed in that void which is peopled by vertigo , and provokes to self-annihilation .
