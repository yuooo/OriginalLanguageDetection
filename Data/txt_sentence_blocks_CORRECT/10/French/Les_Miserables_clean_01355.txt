This hovel , built of old rubbish , which was still in existence in 1845 , was composed , as the reader already knows , of three chambers , all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls . 
The principal one had been given up , by force , for Jean Valjean had opposed it in vain , to M. Madeleine , by Father Fauchelevent . 
The walls of this chamber had for ornament , in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket , a Royalist bank-note of ' 93 , applied to the wall over the chimney-piece , and of which the following is an exact facsimile : -- -LCB- GRAPHIC HERE -RCB- This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener , an old Chouan , who had died in the convent , and whose place Fauchelevent had taken .

He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit .
