thank you for that word , monseigneur ; you confer it upon me to-day , at least , if you have never done so before . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you have saved me . '' 
`` It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room , and to return ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Nearly so . '' 
`` And then to wake Aramis , who sleeps very soundly , when he is asleep , I put that down at another five minutes ; making a total of fifteen minutes ' absence . 
And now , monseigneur , give me your word that you will not in any way attempt to make your escape , and that when I return I shall find you here again . '' 
`` I give it , monsieur , '' replied Fouquet , with an expression of the warmest and deepest gratitude . 
D'Artagnan disappeared .
