This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday , and not Sunday , as Mr. Fogg thought . 
And Passepartout 's famous family watch , which had always kept London time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes ! 
Phileas Fogg , then , had won the twenty thousand pounds ; but , as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way , the pecuniary gain was small . 
His object was , however , to be victorious , and not to win money . 
He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix , against whom he cherished no grudge . 
He deducted , however , from Passepartout 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity . 
That evening , Mr. Fogg , as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever , said to Aouda : `` Is our marriage still agreeable to you ? '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' replied she , `` it is for me to ask that question . 
You were ruined , but now you are rich again . '' 
`` Pardon me , madam ; my fortune belongs to you .
