There is congealment in despair . 
The alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible . 
In the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt , the clock of Saint-Paul struck eleven , gravely and without haste ; for the tocsin is man ; the hour is God . 
The passage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean ; Jean Valjean did not stir . 
Still , at about that moment , a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the Halles , a second yet more violent followed ; it was probably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by Marius . 
At this double discharge , whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night , Jean Valjean started ; he rose , turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded ; then he fell back upon the post again , folded his arms , and his head slowly sank on his bosom again . 
He resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself . 
All at once , he raised his eyes ; some one was walking in the street , he heard steps near him . 
He looked , and by the light of the lanterns , in the direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives , he perceived a young , livid , and beaming face . 
Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue l'Homme Arme .
