Fouquet rose from his seat , passed his arm round D'Artagnan 's neck , and clasped him in a close embrace , whilst with the other hand he pressed his hand . 
`` An excellent homily , '' he said , after a moment 's pause . 
`` A soldier 's , monseigneur . '' 
`` You have a regard for me , in telling me all that . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more , and then , a moment after , he said : `` Where can M. d'Herblay be ? 
I dare not ask you to send for him . '' 
`` You would not ask me , because I would not do it , Monsieur Fouquet . 
People would learn it , and Aramis , who is not mixed up with the affair , might possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace . '' 
`` I will wait here till daylight , '' said Fouquet .
