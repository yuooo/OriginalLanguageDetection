Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet 's flight , and ended with : -- `` Oh ! 
That 's not all . '' 
Gavroche , as he listened , had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in his hand , and mechanically pulled at the upper part , and the blade of a dagger made its appearance . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he exclaimed , pushing the dagger back in haste , `` you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois . '' 
Montparnasse winked . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
resumed Gavroche , `` so you 're going to have a bout with the bobbies ? '' 
`` You ca n't tell , '' replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air . 
`` It 's always a good thing to have a pin about one . ''
