To begin the attack , and with D'Artagnan , would be madness . 
D'Artagnan knows nothing , he has seen nothing ; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree , but if he comes into this room the first this morning , he will be sure to detect something of what has taken place , and which he would imagine it his business to occupy himself about . 
Before we allow D'Artagnan to penetrate into this room , we must air the room thoroughly , or introduce so many people into it , that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different persons . '' 
`` But how can I send him away , since I have given him a rendezvous ? '' 
observed the prince , impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an antagonist . 
`` I will take care of that , '' replied the bishop , `` and in order to begin , I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man . '' 
`` He , too , is striking a blow , for I hear him at the door , '' added the prince , hurriedly . 
And , in fact , a knock at the door was heard at that moment . 
Aramis was not mistaken ; for it was indeed D'Artagnan who adopted that mode of announcing himself . 
We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet , but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep , and as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices of the superintendent 's room , D'Artagnan rose from his armchair , arranged his sword , brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve , like a private soldier getting ready for inspection .
