`` Matelote is homely ! '' 
he cried : `` Matelote is of a dream of ugliness ! 
Matelote is a chimaera . 
This is the secret of her birth : a Gothic Pygmalion , who was making gargoyles for cathedrals , fell in love with one of them , the most horrible , one fine morning . 
He besought Love to give it life , and this produced Matelote . 
Look at her , citizens ! 
She has chromate-of-lead-colored hair , like Titian 's mistress , and she is a good girl . 
I guarantee that she will fight well . 
Every good girl contains a hero . 
As for Mother Hucheloup , she 's an old warrior .
