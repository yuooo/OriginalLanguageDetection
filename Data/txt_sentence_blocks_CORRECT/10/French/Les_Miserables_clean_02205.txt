It was a white envelope . 
Cosette seized it . 
There was no address on one side , no seal on the other . 
Yet the envelope , though unsealed , was not empty . 
Papers could be seen inside . 
Cosette examined it . 
It was no longer alarm , it was no longer curiosity ; it was a beginning of anxiety . 
Cosette drew from the envelope its contents , a little notebook of paper , each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting , as Cosette thought . 
Cosette looked for a name ; there was none . 
To whom was this addressed ?
