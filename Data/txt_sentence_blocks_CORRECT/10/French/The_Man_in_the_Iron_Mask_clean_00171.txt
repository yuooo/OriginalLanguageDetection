But I do more than love M. de la Fere , dear Baisemeaux ; I venerate him . '' 
`` Well , for my part , though 't is singular , '' said the governor , `` I prefer M. d'Artagnan to him . 
There is a man for you , who drinks long and well ! 
That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts . '' 
`` Baisemeaux , make me tipsy to-night ; let us have a merry time of it as of old , and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart , I promise you , you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your glass . '' 
`` Bravo ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , and he poured out a great glass of wine and drank it off at a draught , trembling with joy at the idea of being , by hook or by crook , in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor . 
While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was noting the sounds in the great court . 
A courier came in about eight o'clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle , and , although the courier made a great noise , Baisemeaux heard nothing . 
`` The devil take him , '' said Aramis .
