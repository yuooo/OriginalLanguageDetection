`` It is time to awaken from it . 
Come ! 
let me wake . '' 
Every one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys ; there is hardly a person who , in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is suffocating , has not said to himself , by the help of that light which still burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished , `` It is nothing but a dream , after all . '' 
This was precisely what Louis XIV . 
said to himself ; but when he said , `` Come , come ! 
wake up , '' he perceived that not only was he already awake , but still more , that he had his eyes open also . 
And then he looked all round him . 
On his right hand and on his left two armed men stood in stolid silence , each wrapped in a huge cloak , and the face covered with a mask ; one of them held a small lamp in his hand , whose glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king could look upon . 
Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream still lasted , and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was to move his arms or to say something aloud ; he darted from his bed , and found himself upon the damp , moist ground .
