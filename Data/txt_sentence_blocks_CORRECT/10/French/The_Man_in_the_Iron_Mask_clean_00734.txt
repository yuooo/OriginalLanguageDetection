Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy . 
The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port .
