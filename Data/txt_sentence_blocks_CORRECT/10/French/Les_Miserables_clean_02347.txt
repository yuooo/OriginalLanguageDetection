Therein lies the mystery of tongues . 
To paint with words , which contains figures one knows not how or why , is the primitive foundation of all human languages , what may be called their granite . 
Slang abounds in words of this description , immediate words , words created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom , without etymology , without analogies , without derivatives , solitary , barbarous , sometimes hideous words , which at times possess a singular power of expression and which live . 
The executioner , le taule ; the forest , le sabri ; fear , flight , taf ; the lackey , le larbin ; the mineral , the prefect , the minister , pharos ; the devil , le rabouin . 
Nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal . 
Some , le rabouin , for example , are at the same time grotesque and terrible , and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace . 
ln the second place , metaphor . 
The peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures . 
Metaphor is an enigma , wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke , the prisoner who is arranging an escape , take refuge . 
No idiom is more metaphorical than slang : devisser le coco -LRB- to unscrew the nut -RRB- , to twist the neck ; tortiller -LRB- to wriggle -RRB- , to eat ; etre gerbe , to be tried ; a rat , a bread thief ; il lansquine , it rains , a striking , ancient figure which partly bears its date about it , which assimilates long oblique lines of rain , with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers , and which compresses into a single word the popular expression : it rains halberds .
