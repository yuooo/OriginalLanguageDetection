Fauchelevent 's confidence was perfect . 
At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery , Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse , and said half aloud , as he rubbed his big hands : -- `` Here 's a fine farce ! '' 
All at once the hearse halted ; it had reached the gate . 
The permission for interment must be exhibited . 
The undertaker 's man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery . 
During this colloquy , which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes , some one , a stranger , came and placed himself behind the hearse , beside Fauchelevent . 
He was a sort of laboring man , who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm . 
Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
he demanded .
