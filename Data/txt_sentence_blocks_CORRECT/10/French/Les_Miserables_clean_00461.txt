Let all the clouds fall upon her , and all the ocean sweep over her ! 
What matters it to her ? 
She is a sponge that is soaked . 
At least , she believes it to be so ; but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted , and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever . 
Alas ! 
What are all these fates , driven on pell-mell ? 
Whither are they going ? 
Why are they thus ? 
He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow . 
He is alone .
