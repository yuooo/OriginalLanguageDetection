This rendered him downright intolerable . 
Finally , Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter : `` I 've had enough of that Theodule . 
I have n't much taste for warriors in time of peace . 
Receive him if you choose . 
I do n't know but I prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords . 
The clash of blades in battle is less dismal , after all , than the clank of the scabbard on the pavement . 
And then , throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl , with stays under your cuirass , is doubly ridiculous . 
When one is a veritable man , one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected airs . 
He is neither a blusterer nor a finnicky-hearted man . 
Keep your Theodule for yourself . ''
