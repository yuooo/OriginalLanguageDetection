`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And no one is known here but Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Well ; change nothing in the position of affairs . 
Let the poor madman rot between the slimy walls of the Bastile , and M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness . 
Their new king will absolve them . '' 
`` Your majesty does me a great injustice , sire ; and you are wrong , '' replied Fouquet , dryly ; `` I am not child enough , nor is M. d'Herblay silly enough , to have omitted to make all these reflections ; and if I had wished to make a new king , as you say , I had no occasion to have come here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile , to free you from this place . 
That would show a want of even common sense . 
Your majesty 's mind is disturbed by anger ; otherwise you would be far from offending , groundlessly , the very one of your servants who has rendered you the most important service of all . '' 
Louis perceived that he had gone too far ; that the gates of the Bastile were still closed upon him , whilst , by degrees , the floodgates were gradually being opened , behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had restrained his anger .
