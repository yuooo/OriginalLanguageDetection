It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least , and that she paid the carriage on the letter . 
They managed to obtain the address : Monsieur , Monsieur Thenardier , inn-keeper at Montfermeil . 
The public writer , a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets , was made to talk in the wine-shop . 
In short , it was discovered that Fantine had a child . 
`` She must be a pretty sort of a woman . '' 
An old gossip was found , who made the trip to Montfermeil , talked to the Thenardiers , and said on her return : `` For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind . 
I have seen the child . '' 
The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien , the guardian and door-keeper of every one 's virtue . 
Madame Victurnien was fifty-six , and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age . 
A quavering voice , a whimsical mind .
