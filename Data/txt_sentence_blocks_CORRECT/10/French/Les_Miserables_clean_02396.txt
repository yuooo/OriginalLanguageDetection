Very good . 
Did he wish to pass the evening with Cosette ? 
She was delighted . 
As he always went to bed at ten o'clock , Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour , when , from the street , he heard Cosette open the long glass door on the veranda . 
Of course , no one ever met Marius in the daytime . 
Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was in existence . 
Only once , one morning , he chanced to say to Cosette : `` Why , you have whitewash on your back ! '' 
On the previous evening , Marius , in a transport , had pushed Cosette against the wall . 
Old Toussaint , who retired early , thought of nothing but her sleep , and was as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean . 
Marius never set foot in the house .
