replied the youth . 
`` Ambition , '' replied Aramis , `` is the feeling which prompts a man to desire more - much more - than he possesses . '' 
`` I said that I was contented , monsieur ; but , perhaps , I deceive myself . 
I am ignorant of the nature of ambition ; but it is not impossible I may have some . 
Tell me your mind ; that is all I ask . '' 
`` An ambitious man , '' said Aramis , `` is one who covets that which is beyond his station . '' 
`` I covet nothing beyond my station , '' said the young man , with an assurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes tremble . 
He was silent . 
But to look at the kindling eye , the knitted brow , and the reflective attitude of the captive , it was evident that he expected something more than silence , - a silence which Aramis now broke . 
`` You lied the first time I saw you , '' said he .
