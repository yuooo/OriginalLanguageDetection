The fact is , that three shots were suddenly discharged : the first killed Cholet , chief of the squadron , the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window , the third singed the shoulder of an officer ; a woman screamed : `` They are beginning too soon ! '' 
and all at once , a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time , was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords , through the Rue Bassompierre and the Boulevard Bourdon , sweeping all before them . 
Then all is said , the tempest is loosed , stones rain down , a fusillade breaks forth , many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank , and pass the small arm of the Seine , now filled in , the timber-yards of the Isle Louviers , that vast citadel ready to hand , bristle with combatants , stakes are torn up , pistol-shots fired , a barricade begun , the young men who are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run , and the municipal guard , the carabineers rush up , the dragoons ply their swords , the crowd disperses in all directions , a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of Paris , men shout : `` To arms ! '' 
they run , tumble down , flee , resist . 
Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire . 
THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS Nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot . 
Everything bursts forth everywhere at once . 
Was it foreseen ? 
Yes . 
Was it prepared ?
