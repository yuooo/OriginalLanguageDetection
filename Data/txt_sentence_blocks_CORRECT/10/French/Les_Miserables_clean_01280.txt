`` Everything is arranged , and nothing is , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` I have permission to bring you in ; but before bringing you in you must be got out .

`` You will carry her out ? '' 
`` And she will hold her tongue ? '' 
`` I answer for that . '' 
`` But you , Father Madeleine ? '' 
And , after a silence , fraught with anxiety , Fauchelevent exclaimed : -- `` Why , get out as you came in ! ''
