`` Very well ; then let us go to the steamer , young man ! '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside , where they encountered the Honourable Mr. Batulcar , furious with rage . 
He demanded damages for the `` breakage '' of the pyramid ; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes . 
At half-past six , the very hour of departure , Mr. Fogg and Aouda , followed by Passepartout , who in his hurry had retained his wings , and nose six feet long , stepped upon the American steamer . 
DURING WHICH MR. FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be easily guessed . 
The signals made by the Tankadere had been seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half-mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . 
Phileas Fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix ; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama . 
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November . 
Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic , where he learned , to Aouda 's great delight -- and perhaps to his own , though he betrayed no emotion -- that Passepartout , a Frenchman , had really arrived on her the day before . 
The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find Passepartout , if possible , without delay .
