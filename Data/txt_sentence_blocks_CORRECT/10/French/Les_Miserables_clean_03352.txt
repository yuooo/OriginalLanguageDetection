THE LOWER CHAMBER On the following day , at nightfall , Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the Gillenormand house . 
It was Basque who received him . 
Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour , as though he had received his orders . 
It sometimes happens that one says to a servant : `` You will watch for Mr. So and So , when he arrives . '' 
Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him : `` Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below ? '' 
`` I will remain below , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
Basque , who was perfectly respectful , opened the door of the waiting-room and said : `` I will go and inform Madame . '' 
The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp , vaulted room on the ground floor , which served as a cellar on occasion , which opened on the street , was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window . 
This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather-duster , the pope 's head brush , and the broom . 
The dust rested tranquilly there .
