These ideas were , however , enveloped in a haze , a veil of mystery . 
The actors in this assembly seemed to swim in the vapors of a confused waking . 
Suddenly Louis XIV. , more impatient and more accustomed to command , ran to one of the shutters , which he opened , tearing the curtains in his eagerness . 
A flood of living light entered the chamber , and made Philippe draw back to the alcove . 
Louis seized upon this movement with eagerness , and addressing himself to the queen : `` My mother , '' said he , `` do you not acknowledge your son , since every one here has forgotten his king ! '' 
Anne of Austria started , and raised her arms towards Heaven , without being able to articulate a single word . 
`` My mother , '' said Philippe , with a calm voice , `` do you not acknowledge your son ? '' 
And this time , in his turn , Louis drew back . 
As to Anne of Austria , struck suddenly in head and heart with fell remorse , she lost her equilibrium . 
No one aiding her , for all were petrified , she sank back in her fauteuil , breathing a weak , trembling sigh .
