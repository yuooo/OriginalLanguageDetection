Warn the prince , and then - do what ? 
Take him with me ? 
To carry this accusing witness about with me everywhere ? 
War , too , would follow - civil war , implacable in its nature ! 
And without any resource save myself - it is impossible ! 
What could he do without me ? 
Oh ! 
without me he will be utterly destroyed . 
Yet who knows - let destiny be fulfilled - condemned he was , let him remain so then ! 
Good or evil Spirit - gloomy and scornful Power , whom men call the genius of humanity , thou art a power more restlessly uncertain , more baselessly useless , than wild mountain wind !
