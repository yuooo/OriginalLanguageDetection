`` No , I do n't - by any means . '' 
`` Look here , my friend . 
In the first place , as you have said , to be measured is a loss of time , even though it occur only once a fortnight . 
And then , one may be travelling ; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you . 
In short , I have a horror of letting any one take my measure . 
Confound it ! 
either one is a nobleman or not . 
To be scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you , by inch and line - 't is degrading ! 
Here , they find you too hollow ; there , too prominent . 
They recognize your strong and weak points .
