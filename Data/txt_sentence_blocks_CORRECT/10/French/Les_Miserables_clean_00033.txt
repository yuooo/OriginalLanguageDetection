On his return to the humble dwelling , which he designated , with a smile , as his palace , he said to his sister , `` I have just officiated pontifically . '' 
Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood , there were people in the town who said , when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop , `` It is affectation . '' 
This , however , was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms . 
The populace , which perceives no jest in holy deeds , was touched , and admired him . 
As for the Bishop , it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine , and it was a long time before he recovered from it . 
In fact , when the scaffold is there , all erected and prepared , it has something about it which produces hallucination . 
One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty , one may refrain from pronouncing upon it , from saying yes or no , so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one 's own eyes : but if one encounters one of them , the shock is violent ; one is forced to decide , and to take part for or against . 
Some admire it , like de Maistre ; others execrate it , like Beccaria . 
The guillotine is the concretion of the law ; it is called vindicte ; it is not neutral , and it does not permit you to remain neutral . 
He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers .
