said Thenardier , and he redoubled his pace . 
The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them . 
When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket , he wheeled round . 
It was in vain that Thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches ; he could not prevent the man seeing him . 
The man cast upon him an uneasy glance , then elevated his head and continued his course . 
The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit . 
Thus they continued for two or three hundred paces . 
All at once the man turned round once more ; he saw the inn-keeper . 
This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Thenardier decided that it was `` useless '' to proceed further . 
Thenardier retraced his steps .
