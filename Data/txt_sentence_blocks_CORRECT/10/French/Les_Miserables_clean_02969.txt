Europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion . 
As for France , we have just cited its figures . 
Now , Paris contains one twenty-fifth of the total population of France , and Parisian guano being the richest of all , we understate the truth when we value the loss on the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which France annually rejects . 
These twenty-five millions , employed in assistance and enjoyment , would double the splendor of Paris . 
The city spends them in sewers . 
So that we may say that Paris 's great prodigality , its wonderful festival , its Beaujon folly , its orgy , its stream of gold from full hands , its pomp , its luxury , its magnificence , is its sewer system . 
It is in this manner that , in the blindness of a poor political economy , we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the well-being of all . 
There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the public fortune . 
Economically considered , the matter can be summed up thus : Paris is a spendthrift . 
Paris , that model city , that patron of well-arranged capitals , of which every nation strives to possess a copy , that metropolis of the ideal , that august country of the initiative , of impulse and of effort , that centre and that dwelling of minds , that nation-city , that hive of the future , that marvellous combination of Babylon and Corinth , would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders , from the point of view which we have just indicated .
