During this sweet month of May , Marius and Cosette learned to know these immense delights . 
To dispute and to say you for thou , simply that they might say thou the better afterwards . 
To talk at great length with very minute details , of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world ; another proof that in that ravishing opera called love , the libretto counts for almost nothing ; For Marius , to listen to Cosette discussing finery ; For Cosette , to listen to Marius talk in politics ; To listen , knee pressed to knee , to the carriages rolling along the Rue de Babylone ; To gaze upon the same planet in space , or at the same glowworm gleaming in the grass ; To hold their peace together ; a still greater delight than conversation ; Etc. , etc. . 
In the meantime , divers complications were approaching . 
One evening , Marius was on his way to the rendezvous , by way of the Boulevard des Invalides . 
He habitually walked with drooping head . 
As he was on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet , he heard some one quite close to him say : -- `` Good evening , Monsieur Marius . '' 
He raised his head and recognized Eponine . 
This produced a singular effect upon him . 
He had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue Plumet , he had not seen her again , and she had gone completely out of his mind .
