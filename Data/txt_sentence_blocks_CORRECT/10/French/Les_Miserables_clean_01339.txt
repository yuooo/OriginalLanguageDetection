`` I am cold , '' said Jean Valjean . 
This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality , and there was pressing need of it . 
The souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves , although they did not realize it , and there was about them something uncanny , which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place . 
`` Let us get out of here quickly , '' exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
He fumbled in his pocket , and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself . 
`` But first , take a drop , '' said he . 
The flask finished what the fresh air had begun , Jean Valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy , and regained full possession of his faculties . 
He got out of the coffin , and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid again . 
Three minutes later they were out of the grave . 
Moreover , Fauchelevent was perfectly composed .
