Night came . 
The moon was entering her first quarter , and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon . 
Clouds were rising from the east , and already overcast a part of the heavens . 
The pilot had hung out his lights , which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward ; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences , and , at the speed she was going , the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft . 
Fix , seated in the bow , gave himself up to meditation . 
He kept apart from his fellow-travellers , knowing Mr. Fogg 's taciturn tastes ; besides , he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted . 
He was thinking , too , of the future . 
It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama , but would at once take the boat for San Francisco ; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety . 
Fogg 's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world . 
Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States , like a common villain , he had traversed three quarters of the globe , so as to gain the American continent more surely ; and there , after throwing the police off his track , he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank .
