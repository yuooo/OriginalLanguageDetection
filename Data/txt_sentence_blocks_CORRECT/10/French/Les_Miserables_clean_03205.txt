Do you know what he did , sir ? 
He intervened like an archangel . 
He must have flung himself into the midst of the battle , have stolen me away , have opened the sewer , have dragged me into it and have carried me through it ! 
He must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries , bent over , weighed down , in the dark , in the cess-pool , -- more than a league and a half , sir , with a corpse upon his back ! 
And with what object ? 
With the sole object of saving the corpse . 
And that corpse I was . 
He said to himself : ` There may still be a glimpse of life there , perchance ; I will risk my own existence for that miserable spark ! ' 
And his existence he risked not once but twenty times ! 
And every step was a danger .
