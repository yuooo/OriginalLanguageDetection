We are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant . 
Here , then , is the superstition of Montfermeil : it is thought that the devil , from time immemorial , has selected the forest as a hiding-place for his treasures . 
Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall , in secluded nooks of the forest , a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper , wearing wooden shoes , clad in trousers and a blouse of linen , and recognizable by the fact , that , instead of a cap or hat , he has two immense horns on his head . 
This ought , in fact , to render him recognizable . 
This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole . 
There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter . 
The first is to approach the man and speak to him . 
Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant , that he appears black because it is nightfall ; that he is not digging any hole whatever , but is cutting grass for his cows , and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back , and whose teeth , thanks to the perspective of evening , seemed to spring from his head . 
The man returns home and dies within the week . 
The second way is to watch him , to wait until he has dug his hole , until he has filled it and has gone away ; then to run with great speed to the trench , to open it once more and to seize the `` treasure '' which the black man has necessarily placed there .
