resumed Madame Thenardier , examining the half-filled glass , `` this will be enough . '' 
Cosette applied herself to her work once more , but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake . 
She counted the minutes that passed in this manner , and wished it were the next morning . 
From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street , and exclaimed , `` It 's as black as an oven ! '' 
or , `` One must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour ! '' 
And Cosette trembled . 
All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered , and said in a harsh voice : -- `` My horse has not been watered . '' 
`` Yes , it has , '' said Madame Thenardier . 
`` I tell you that it has not , '' retorted the pedler . 
Cosette had emerged from under the table .
