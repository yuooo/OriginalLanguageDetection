This allusion to the thunder , all the consequences of which Gavroche , in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century , accepted , was followed by a broad flash of lightning , so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack . 
Almost at the same instant , the thunder rumbled with great fury . 
The two little creatures uttered a shriek , and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced , but Gavroche turned his bold face to them , and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh . 
`` Calm down , children . 
Do n't topple over the edifice . 
That 's fine , first-class thunder ; all right . 
That 's no slouch of a streak of lightning . 
Bravo for the good God ! 
Deuce take it ! 
It 's almost as good as it is at the Ambigu . ''
