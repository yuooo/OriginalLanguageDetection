`` I want a rhyme to lumiere . '' 
`` Orniere , '' answered La Fontaine . 
`` Ah , but , my good friend , one can not talk of wheel-ruts when celebrating the delights of Vaux , '' said Loret . 
`` Besides , it does n't rhyme , '' answered Pelisson . 
`` What ! 
does n't rhyme ! '' 
cried La Fontaine , in surprise . 
`` Yes ; you have an abominable habit , my friend , - a habit which will ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order . 
You rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , oh , you think so , do you , Pelisson ? ''
