`` How , '' stammered he , `` will you carry on the directions of the different corps ? '' 
`` When you are gone , monsieur , '' replied the commander of the fleet , `` it is to me the command of the whole is committed . '' 
`` Then , monsieur , '' rejoined Colbert 's man , addressing the new leader , `` it is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended . 
Let us see your powers . '' 
`` Here they are , '' said the officer , exhibiting the royal signature . 
`` Here are your instructions , '' replied the officer , placing the folded paper in his hands ; and turning round towards D'Artagnan , `` Come , monsieur , '' said he , in an agitated voice -LRB- such despair did he behold in that man of iron -RRB- , `` do me the favor to depart at once . '' 
`` Immediately ! '' 
articulated D'Artagnan , feebly , subdued , crushed by implacable impossibility . 
And he painfully subsided into the little boat , which started , favored by wind and tide , for the coast of France . 
The king 's guards embarked with him .
