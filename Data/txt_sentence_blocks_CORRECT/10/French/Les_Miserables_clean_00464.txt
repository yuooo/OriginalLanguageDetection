This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois . 
The woman , a melancholy , decorated spectre which went and came through the snow , made him no reply , did not even glance at him , and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence , and with a sombre regularity , which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm , like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods . 
The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger ; and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned , he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf , and stifling his laugh , bent down , picked up a handful of snow from the pavement , and thrust it abruptly into her back , between her bare shoulders . 
The woman uttered a roar , whirled round , gave a leap like a panther , and hurled herself upon the man , burying her nails in his face , with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter . 
These insults , poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy , did , indeed , proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth . 
It was Fantine . 
At the noise thus produced , the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe , passers-by collected , and a large and merry circle , hooting and applauding , was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings , whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman : the man struggling , his hat on the ground ; the woman striking out with feet and fists , bareheaded , howling , minus hair and teeth , livid with wrath , horrible . 
Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd , seized the woman by her satin bodice , which was covered with mud , and said to her , `` Follow me ! '' 
The woman raised her head ; her furious voice suddenly died away . 
Her eyes were glassy ; she turned pale instead of livid , and she trembled with a quiver of terror .
