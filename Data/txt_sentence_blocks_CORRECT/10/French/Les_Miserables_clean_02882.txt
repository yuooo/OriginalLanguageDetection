The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil , they do not think about . 
The indefinite , which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite , escapes them . 
Provided that they are face to face with immensity , they smile . 
Joy never , ecstasy forever . 
Their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation . 
The history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan . 
All is not there ; the true All remains without ; what is the use of busying oneself over that detail , man ? 
Man suffers , that is quite possible ; but look at Aldebaran rising ! 
The mother has no more milk , the new-born babe is dying . 
I know nothing about that , but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents under the microscope !
