`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is very polite , duke , and you are right in being so ; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your chambre-de - ville , I should have been courteous to you , I assure you , on the word of a gentleman ! 
Now , one favor more ; what does the king want with me ? '' 
`` Oh , the king is furious ! '' 
`` Very well ! 
the king , who has thought it worth while to be angry , may take the trouble to grow calm again ; that is all . 
I sha n't die of that , I will swear . '' 
`` No , but - '' `` But - I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet . 
Mordioux ! 
That is a gallant man , a worthy man ! 
We shall live very sociably together , I will be sworn . ''
