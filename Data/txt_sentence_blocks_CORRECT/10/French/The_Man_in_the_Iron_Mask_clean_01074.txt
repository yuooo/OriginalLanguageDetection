In fact , fallen in their ranks , stiff , icy , the dead , still recognizable with ease , seemed to turn with complacency towards the Comte de la Fere , to be the better seen by him , during his sad review . 
But yet , he was astonished , while viewing all these bodies , not to perceive the survivors . 
To such a point did the illusion extend , that this vision was for him a real voyage made by the father into Africa , to obtain more exact information respecting his son . 
Fatigued , therefore , with having traversed seas and continents , he sought repose under one of the tents sheltered behind a rock , on the top of which floated the white fleur-de-lised pennon . 
He looked for a soldier to conduct him to the tent of M. de Beaufort . 
Then , while his eye was wandering over the plain , turning on all sides , he saw a white form appear behind the scented myrtles . 
This figure was clothed in the costume of an officer ; it held in its hand a broken sword ; it advanced slowly towards Athos , who , stopping short and fixing his eyes upon it , neither spoke nor moved , but wished to open his arms , because in this silent officer he had already recognized Raoul . 
The comte attempted to utter a cry , but it was stifled in his throat . 
Raoul , with a gesture , directed him to be silent , placing his finger on his lips and drawing back by degrees , without Athos being able to see his legs move . 
The comte , still paler than Raoul , followed his son , painfully traversing briers and bushes , stones and ditches , Raoul not appearing to touch the earth , no obstacle seeming to impede the lightness of his march .
