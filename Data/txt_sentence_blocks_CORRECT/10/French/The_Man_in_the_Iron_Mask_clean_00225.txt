This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes which the young man had requested . 
During this space of time , which appeared an eternity , Philippe continued gazing with an imploring and sorrowful look towards the heavens ; Aramis did not remove the piercing glance he had fixed on Philippe . 
Suddenly the young man bowed his head . 
His thought returned to the earth , his looks perceptibly hardened , his brow contracted , his mouth assuming an expression of undaunted courage ; again his looks became fixed , but this time they wore a worldly expression , hardened by covetousness , pride , and strong desire . 
Aramis 's look immediately became as soft as it had before been gloomy . 
Philippe , seizing his hand in a quick , agitated manner , exclaimed : `` Lead me to where the crown of France is to be found . '' 
`` Is this your decision , monseigneur ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` It is . '' 
`` Irrevocably so ? ''
