The Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations . 
Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the Sons of the Sun . 
He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama . 
He found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter , the houses having low fronts , and being adorned with verandas , beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles . 
This quarter occupied , with its streets , squares , docks , and warehouses , all the space between the `` promontory of the Treaty '' and the river . 
Here , as at Hong Kong and Calcutta , were mixed crowds of all races , Americans and English , Chinamen and Dutchmen , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything . 
The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of Hottentots . 
He had , at least , one resource to call on the French and English consuls at Yokohama for assistance . 
But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master ; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid . 
As chance did not favour him in the European quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese , determined , if necessary , to push on to Yeddo .
