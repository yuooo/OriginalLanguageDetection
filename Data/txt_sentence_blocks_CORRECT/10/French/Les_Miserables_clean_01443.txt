At bottom , the man is the same . 
The one has devoted his life to his country here below , the other to his country on high ; that is the only difference . 
Twice a year , on the first of January and on St. George 's day , Marius wrote duty letters to his father , which were dictated by his aunt , and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula ; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated ; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread . 
REQUIESCANT Madame de T. 's salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world . 
It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life . 
This opening was sombre , and more cold than warmth , more night than day , came to him through this skylight . 
This child , who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world , soon became melancholy , and , what is still more contrary to his age , grave . 
Surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages , he gazed about him with serious amazement . 
Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him . 
There were in Madame de T. 's salon some very noble ladies named Mathan , Noe , Levis , -- which was pronounced Levi , -- Cambis , pronounced Cambyse .
