I tell you . '' 
`` Marius ' love affairs ! '' 
exclaimed Grantaire . 
`` I can imagine it . 
Marius is a fog , and he must have found a vapor . 
Marius is of the race of poets . 
He who says poet , says fool , madman , Tymbraeus Apollo . 
Marius and his Marie , or his Marion , or his Maria , or his Mariette . 
They must make a queer pair of lovers . 
I know just what it is like .
