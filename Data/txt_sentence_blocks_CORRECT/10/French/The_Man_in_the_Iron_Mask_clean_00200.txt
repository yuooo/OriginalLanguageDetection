`` Then if you do n't know it , I am right ; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards one of obscure station . '' 
`` Good ; the regulations so provide . 
They are to the effect that the turnkey , or one of the lower officials , shall bring the prisoner before the governor , in the office . '' 
`` Well , 't is very wise , that ; and then ? '' 
`` Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his imprisonment , his clothes and papers , if the minister 's orders have not otherwise dictated . '' 
`` What was the minister 's order as to this Marchiali ? '' 
`` Nothing ; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels , without papers , and almost without clothes . '' 
`` See how simple , then , all is . 
Indeed , Baisemeaux , you make a mountain of everything . 
Remain here , and make them bring the prisoner to the governor 's house . ''
