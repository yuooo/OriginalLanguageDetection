A second bullet struck the other guard , who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast , and laid him low on the pavement . 
This was the work of Marius , who had just entered the barricade . 
THE BARREL OF POWDER Marius , still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondetour , had witnessed , shuddering and irresolute , the first phase of the combat . 
But he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss . 
In the presence of the imminence of the peril , in the presence of the death of M. Mabeuf , that melancholy enigma , in the presence of Bahorel killed , and Courfeyrac shouting : `` Follow me ! '' 
of that child threatened , of his friends to succor or to avenge , all hesitation had vanished , and he had flung himself into the conflict , his two pistols in hand . 
With his first shot he had saved Gavroche , and with the second delivered Courfeyrac . 
Amid the sound of the shots , amid the cries of the assaulted guards , the assailants had climbed the entrenchment , on whose summit Municipal Guards , soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs could now be seen , gun in hand , rearing themselves to more than half the height of their bodies . 
They already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier , but they did not leap into the enclosure , as though wavering in the fear of some trap . 
They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion 's den .
