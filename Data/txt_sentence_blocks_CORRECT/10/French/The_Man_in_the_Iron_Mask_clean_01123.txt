The king alighted ; Madame de Montespan followed his example . 
They were in front of an isolated chapel , concealed by huge trees , already despoiled of their leaves by the first cutting winds of autumn . 
Behind this chapel was an inclosure , closed by a latticed gate . 
The falcon had beaten down his prey in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel , and the king was desirous of going in to take the first feather , according to custom .

`` Here repose men that we knew well , '' said D'Artagnan , greatly agitated .
