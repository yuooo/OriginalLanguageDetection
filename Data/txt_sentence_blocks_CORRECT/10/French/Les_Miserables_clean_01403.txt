He was a peculiar old man , and in very truth , a man of another age , the real , complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century , who wore his good , old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates . 
He was over ninety years of age , his walk was erect , he talked loudly , saw clearly , drank neat , ate , slept , and snored . 
He had all thirty-two of his teeth . 
He only wore spectacles when he read . 
He was of an amorous disposition , but declared that , for the last ten years , he had wholly and decidedly renounced women . 
He could no longer please , he said ; he did not add : `` I am too old , '' but : `` I am too poor . '' 
He said : `` If I were not ruined -- Heee ! '' 
All he had left , in fact , was an income of about fifteen thousand francs . 
His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses . 
He did not belong , as the reader will perceive , to that puny variety of octogenaries who , like M. de Voltaire , have been dying all their life ; his was no longevity of a cracked pot ; this jovial old man had always had good health .
