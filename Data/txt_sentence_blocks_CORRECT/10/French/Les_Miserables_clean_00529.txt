Sister Simplice was white , with a waxen pallor . 
Beside Sister Perpetue , she was the taper beside the candle . 
Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words , in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude : `` They shall have for their convent only the house of the sick ; for cell only a hired room ; for chapel only their parish church ; for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals ; for enclosure only obedience ; for gratings only the fear of God ; for veil only modesty . '' 
This ideal was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice : she had never been young , and it seemed as though she would never grow old . 
No one could have told Sister Simplice 's age . 
She was a person -- we dare not say a woman -- who was gentle , austere , well-bred , cold , and who had never lied . 
She was so gentle that she appeared fragile ; but she was more solid than granite . 
She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine . 
There was , so to speak , silence in her speech ; she said just what was necessary , and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room . 
This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown , finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of God .
