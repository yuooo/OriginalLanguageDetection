It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable . 
Now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship 's chronometers . 
His triumph was hilarious . 
He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard ! 
`` The rogue told me a lot of stories , '' repeated Passepartout , `` about the meridians , the sun , and the moon ! 
Moon , indeed ! 
moonshine more likely ! 
If one listened to that sort of people , a pretty sort of time one would keep ! 
I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch ! '' 
Passepartout was ignorant that , if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours , like the Italian clocks , he would have no reason for exultation ; for the hands of his watch would then , instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning , indicate nine o'clock in the evening , that is , the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian .
