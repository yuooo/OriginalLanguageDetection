He said , `` Examine the road over which the fault has passed . '' 
Being , as he described himself with a smile , an ex-sinner , he had none of the asperities of austerity , and he professed , with a good deal of distinctness , and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous , a doctrine which may be summed up as follows : -- `` Man has upon him his flesh , which is at once his burden and his temptation . 
He drags it with him and yields to it . 
He must watch it , cheek it , repress it , and obey it only at the last extremity . 
There may be some fault even in this obedience ; but the fault thus committed is venial ; it is a fall , but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer . 
`` To be a saint is the exception ; to be an upright man is the rule . 
Err , fall , sin if you will , but be upright . 
`` The least possible sin is the law of man . 
No sin at all is the dream of the angel . 
All which is terrestrial is subject to sin .
