People had just emerged from Ossian ; elegance was Scandinavian and Caledonian ; the pure English style was only to prevail later , and the first of the Arthurs , Wellington , had but just won the battle of Waterloo . 
These Oscars bore the names , one of Felix Tholomyes , of Toulouse ; the second , Listolier , of Cahors ; the next , Fameuil , of Limoges ; the last , Blachevelle , of Montauban . 
Naturally , each of them had his mistress . 
Blachevelle loved Favourite , so named because she had been in England ; Listolier adored Dahlia , who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower ; Fameuil idolized Zephine , an abridgment of Josephine ; Tholomyes had Fantine , called the Blonde , because of her beautiful , sunny hair . 
Favourite , Dahlia , Zephine , and Fantine were four ravishing young women , perfumed and radiant , still a little like working-women , and not yet entirely divorced from their needles ; somewhat disturbed by intrigues , but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil , and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman . 
One of the four was called the young , because she was the youngest of them , and one was called the old ; the old one was twenty-three . 
Not to conceal anything , the three first were more experienced , more heedless , and more emancipated into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde , who was still in her first illusions . 
Dahlia , Zephine , and especially Favourite , could not have said as much . 
There had already been more than one episode in their romance , though hardly begun ; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second , and Gustave in the third . 
Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors ; one scolds and the other flatters , and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear , each on its own side .
