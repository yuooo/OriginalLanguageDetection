One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other . 
Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events . 
The bedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment . 
Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour , in such a place , betokened something threatening . 
Gavroche felt his gamin 's heart moved with compassion for the old man . 
What was he to do ? 
Interfere ? 
One weakness coming to the aid of another ! 
It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse .
