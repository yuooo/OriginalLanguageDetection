said D'Artagnan , in his turn ; `` are you unwell , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I have a tertian fever , which seized me after the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Caught cold in the grottos , at night , perhaps ? '' 
`` No , no ; nothing but agitation , that was all . '' 
`` The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king , '' said La Fontaine , quietly , without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege . 
`` We can not devote too much heart to the reception of our king , '' said Fouquet , mildly , to his poet . 
`` Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , with perfect frankness and much amenity . 
`` The fact is , monseigneur , that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux . '' 
Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted himself well towards the king , the king had hardly done the like to the minister . 
But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret .
