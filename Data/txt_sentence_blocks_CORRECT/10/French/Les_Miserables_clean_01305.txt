Fauchelevent , who was deadly pale , stared at this Gribier . 
He was a tall , thin , livid , utterly funereal man . 
He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger . 
Fauchelevent burst out laughing . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said he , `` what queer things do happen ! 
Father Mestienne is dead , but long live little Father Lenoir ! 
Do you know who little Father Lenoir is ? 
He is a jug of red wine . 
It is a jug of Surene , morbigou !
