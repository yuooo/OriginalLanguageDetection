At Weltingen he received into his arms , beneath a storm of bullets , Colonel Maupetit , mortally wounded at the head of the 9th Dragoons . 
He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy 's fire . 
When the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line , Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the Guard . 
The Emperor gave him the cross . 
Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua , Melas , and Alexandria , Mack at Ulm , made prisoners in succession . 
He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier commanded , and which captured Hamburg . 
Then he was transferred to the 55th of the line , which was the old regiment of Flanders . 
At Eylau he was in the cemetery where , for the space of two hours , the heroic Captain Louis Hugo , the uncle of the author of this book , sustained alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army . 
Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery . 
He was at Friedland .
