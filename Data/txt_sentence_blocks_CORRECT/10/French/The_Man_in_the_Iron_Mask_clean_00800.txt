`` Pardieu ! '' 
replied Fouquet , laconically ; and rode on faster . 
D'Artagnan was nearly mad ; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his eyes . 
`` In the king 's name ! '' 
cried he again , `` stop , or I will bring you down with a pistol-shot ! '' 
`` Do ! '' 
replied Fouquet , without relaxing his speed . 
D'Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it , hoping that the double click of the spring would stop his enemy . 
`` You have pistols likewise , '' said he , `` turn and defend yourself . '' 
Fouquet did turn round at the noise , and looking D'Artagnan full in the face , opened , with his right hand , the part of his dress which concealed his body , but he did not even touch his holsters .
