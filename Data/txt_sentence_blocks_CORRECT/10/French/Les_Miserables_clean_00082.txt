BAPTISTINE . 
P.S. Your grand nephew is charming . 
Do you know that he will soon be five years old ? 
Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps , and he said , `` What has he got on his knees ? ''

As will be perceived from this letter , these two women understood how to mould themselves to the Bishop 's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself . 
The Bishop of D -- , in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him , sometimes did things that were grand , bold , and magnificent , without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact . 
They trembled , but they let him alone . 
Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance , but never at the time , nor afterwards .
