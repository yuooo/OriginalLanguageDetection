While they were thus embarrassed , a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop , by two unknown horsemen , who departed on the instant . 
The chest was opened ; it contained a cope of cloth of gold , a mitre ornamented with diamonds , an archbishop 's cross , a magnificent crosier , -- all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun . 
In the chest was a paper , on which these words were written , `` From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu . '' 
`` Did not I say that things would come right of themselves ? '' 
said the Bishop . 
Then he added , with a smile , `` To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate , God sends the cope of an archbishop . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' murmured the cure , throwing back his head with a smile . 
`` God -- or the Devil . '' 
The Bishop looked steadily at the cure , and repeated with authority , `` God ! '' 
When he returned to Chastelar , the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity , all along the road .
