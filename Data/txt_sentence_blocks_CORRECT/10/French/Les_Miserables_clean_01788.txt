But the apothecary ! 
How am I to pay them ? 
I would kneel to a penny , sir ! 
Such is the condition to which the arts are reduced . 
And do you know , my charming young lady , and you , my generous protector , do you know , you who breathe forth virtue and goodness , and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers ? 
-- For I have brought up my children religiously , sir . 
I did not want them to take to the theatre . 
Ah ! 
the hussies ! 
If I catch them tripping !
