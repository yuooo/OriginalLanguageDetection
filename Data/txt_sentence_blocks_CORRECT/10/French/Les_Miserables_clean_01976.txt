You have , in the first case , Napoleon ; in the second , Iturbide . 
But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty . 
There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in a race , and the wrinkle of the centuries can not be improvised . 
If we place ourselves at the point of view of the `` statesmen , '' after making all allowances , of course , after a revolution , what are the qualities of the king which result from it ? 
He may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary ; that is to say , a participant in his own person in that revolution , that he should have lent a hand to it , that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein , that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it . 
What are the qualities of a dynasty ? 
It should be national ; that is to say , revolutionary at a distance , not through acts committed , but by reason of ideas accepted . 
It should be composed of past and be historic ; be composed of future and be sympathetic . 
All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man , Cromwell or Napoleon ; and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family , the House of Brunswick or the House of Orleans . 
Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees , each branch of which , bending over to the earth , takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself .
