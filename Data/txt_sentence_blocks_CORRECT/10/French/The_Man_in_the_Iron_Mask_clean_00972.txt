We have said that the light produced by the spark and the match did not last more than two seconds ; but during these two seconds this is what it illumined : in the first place , the giant , enlarged in the darkness ; then , at ten paces off , a heap of bleeding bodies , crushed , mutilated , in the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony , lifting the mass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying in the night . 
Every breath of Porthos , thus vivifying the match , sent towards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent aura , mingled with streaks of purple . 
In addition to this principal group scattered about the grotto , as the chances of death or surprise had stretched them , isolated bodies seemed to be making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds . 
Above ground , bedded in pools of blood , rose , heavy and sparkling , the short , thick pillars of the cavern , of which the strongly marked shades threw out the luminous particles . 
And all this was seen by the tremulous light of a match attached to a barrel of powder , that is to say , a torch which , whilst throwing a light on the dead past , showed death to come . 
As I have said , this spectacle did not last above two seconds . 
During this short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together eight men armed with muskets , and , through an opening , ordered them to fire upon Porthos . 
But they who received the order to fire trembled so that three guards fell by the discharge , and the five remaining balls hissed on to splinter the vault , plow the ground , or indent the pillars of the cavern . 
A burst of laughter replied to this volley ; then the arm of the giant swung round ; then was seen whirling through the air , like a falling star , the train of fire . 
The barrel , hurled a distance of thirty feet , cleared the barricade of dead bodies , and fell amidst a group of shrieking soldiers , who threw themselves on their faces .
