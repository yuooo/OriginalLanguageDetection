`` Gracious , replied the child , `` we have no lodging . '' 
`` Bother ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , `` you do n't say ` lodgings , ' you say ` crib . ' '' 
`` And then , we were afraid of being alone like that at night . '' 
`` You do n't say ` night , ' you say ` darkmans . ' '' 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the child . 
`` Listen , '' went on Gavroche , `` you must never bawl again over anything . 
I 'll take care of you . 
You shall see what fun we 'll have .
