Then he saw Moscow . 
Then La Beresina , then Lutzen , Bautzen , Dresden , Wachau , Leipzig , and the defiles of Gelenhausen ; then Montmirail , Chateau-Thierry , Craon , the banks of the Marne , the banks of the Aisne , and the redoubtable position of Laon . 
At Arnay-Le-Duc , being then a captain , he put ten Cossacks to the sword , and saved , not his general , but his corporal . 
He was well slashed up on this occasion , and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone . 
Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry . 
He had what was called under the old regime , the double hand , that is to say , an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier , or a squadron or a battalion as an officer . 
It is from this aptitude , perfected by a military education , which certain special branches of the service arise , the dragoons , for example , who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time . 
He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba . 
At Waterloo , he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers , in Dubois ' brigade . 
It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion .
