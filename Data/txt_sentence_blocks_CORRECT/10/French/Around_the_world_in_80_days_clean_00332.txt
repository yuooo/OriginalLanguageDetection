They all got upon the train , which was just ready to start , at half-past one ; at dawn of day they were in Dublin ; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which , disdaining to rise upon the waves , invariably cut through them .

He was only six hours distant from London .

`` I am . '' 
`` I arrest you in the Queen 's name ! '' 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON Phileas Fogg was in prison .
