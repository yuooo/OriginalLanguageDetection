This man , we will state at once , was a former member of the Convention . 
His name was G -- Member of the Convention , G -- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D -- A member of the Convention -- can you imagine such a thing ? 
That existed from the time when people called each other thou , and when they said `` citizen . '' 
This man was almost a monster . 
He had not voted for the death of the king , but almost . 
He was a quasi-regicide . 
He had been a terrible man . 
How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost 's court , on the return of the legitimate princes ? 
They need not have cut off his head , if you please ; clemency must be exercised , agreed ; but a good banishment for life . 
An example , in short , etc. .
