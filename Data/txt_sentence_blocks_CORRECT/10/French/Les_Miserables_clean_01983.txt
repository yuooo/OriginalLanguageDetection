Incorruptible by sacristans , by whippers-in , by ballet-dancers ; this made a part of his bourgeois popularity . 
He had no heart . 
He went out with his umbrella under his arm , and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole . 
He was a bit of a mason , a bit of a gardener , something of a doctor ; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse ; Louis Philippe no more went about without his lancet , than did Henri IV . 
without his poniard . 
The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king , the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing . 
For the grievances against Louis Philippe , there is one deduction to be made ; there is that which accuses royalty , that which accuses the reign , that which accuses the King ; three columns which all give different totals . 
Democratic right confiscated , progress becomes a matter of secondary interest , the protests of the street violently repressed , military execution of insurrections , the rising passed over by arms , the Rue Transnonain , the counsels of war , the absorption of the real country by the legal country , on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons , -- these are the deeds of royalty ; Belgium refused , Algeria too harshly conquered , and , as in the case of India by the English , with more barbarism than civilization , the breach of faith , to Abd-el-Kader , Blaye , Deutz bought , Pritchard paid , -- these are the doings of the reign ; the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the King . 
As will be seen , the proper deduction having been made , the King 's charge is decreased . 
This is his great fault ; he was modest in the name of France .
