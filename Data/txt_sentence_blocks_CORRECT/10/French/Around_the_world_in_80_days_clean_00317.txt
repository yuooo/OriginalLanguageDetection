Not the least in the world . 
It was Phileas Fogg , Esquire . 
As for Captain Speedy , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive . 
What had happened was very simple . 
Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool , but the captain would not carry him there . 
Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux , and , during the thirty hours he had been on board , had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers , who were only an occasional crew , and were not on the best terms with the captain , went over to him in a body . 
This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool . 
It was very clear , to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft , that he had been a sailor . 
How the adventure ended will be seen anon . 
Aouda was anxious , though she said nothing .
