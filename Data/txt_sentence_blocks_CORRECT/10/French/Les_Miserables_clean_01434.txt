He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel , where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm . 
Then he passed to the frontier of Italy , and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert . 
Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general , and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant . 
Pontmercy was by Berthier 's side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say : `` Berthier has been cannoneer , cavalier , and grenadier . '' 
He beheld his old general , Joubert , fall at Novi , at the moment when , with uplifted sabre , he was shouting : `` Forward ! '' 
Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign , on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast , he fell into a wasps ' - nest of seven or eight English vessels . 
The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea , to hide the soldiers between decks , and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel . 
Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak , and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates . 
Twenty leagues further on , his audacity having increased , he attacked with his pinnace , and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily , and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea . 
In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand .
