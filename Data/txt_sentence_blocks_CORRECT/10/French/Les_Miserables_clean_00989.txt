You see , sir , we do not ask charity , and we can not bestow it . 
We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal . 
The license , the imposts , the door and window tax , the hundredths ! 
Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money . 
And then , I have my daughters . 
I have no need to bring up other people 's children . '' 
The man resumed , in that voice which he strove to render indifferent , and in which there lingered a tremor : -- `` What if one were to rid you of her ? '' 
`` Who ? 
Cosette ? '' 
`` Yes . ''
