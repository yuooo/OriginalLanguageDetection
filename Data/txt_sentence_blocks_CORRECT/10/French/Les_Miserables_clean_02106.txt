Paphos had been made over into Eden . 
It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome . 
This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul . 
This coquettish garden , formerly decidedly compromised , had returned to virginity and modesty . 
A justice assisted by a gardener , a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon , and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lenotre , had turned it about , cut , ruffled , decked , moulded it to gallantry ; nature had taken possession of it once more , had filled it with shade , and had arranged it for love . 
There was , also , in this solitude , a heart which was quite ready . 
Love had only to show himself ; he had here a temple composed of verdure , grass , moss , the sight of birds , tender shadows , agitated branches , and a soul made of sweetness , of faith , of candor , of hope , of aspiration , and of illusion . 
Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child ; she was a little more than fourteen , and she was at the `` ungrateful age '' ; we have already said , that with the exception of her eyes , she was homely rather than pretty ; she had no ungraceful feature , but she was awkward , thin , timid and bold at once , a grown-up little girl , in short . 
Her education was finished , that is to say , she has been taught religion , and even and above all , devotion ; then `` history , '' that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents , geography , grammar , the participles , the kings of France , a little music , a little drawing , etc. ; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant , which is a great charm and a great peril . 
The soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later on , mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there , as in a dark chamber .
