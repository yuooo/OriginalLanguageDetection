As he passed through the Cathedral Square , he shook his fist at the church . 
At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment . 
It is there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard to the army , brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon himself , were printed for the first time . 
Worn out with fatigue , and no longer entertaining any hope , he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office . 
At that moment an old woman came out of the church . 
She saw the man stretched out in the shadow . 
`` What are you doing there , my friend ? '' 
said she . 
He answered harshly and angrily : `` As you see , my good woman , I am sleeping . '' 
The good woman , who was well worthy the name , in fact , was the Marquise de R -- `` On this bench ? ''
