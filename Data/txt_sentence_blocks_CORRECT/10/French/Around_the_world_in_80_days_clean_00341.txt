Mr. Fogg went to bed , but did he sleep ? 
Aouda did not once close her eyes . 
Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his master 's door . 
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get Aouda 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself . 
He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights . 
In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment 's conversation with the young lady . 
Passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them . 
He looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him . 
His heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster . 
Yes !
