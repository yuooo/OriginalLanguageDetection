The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon . 
Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days ! 
Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds ! 
How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day ? 
How came he to think that he had arrived in London on Saturday , the twenty-first day of December , when it was really Friday , the twentieth , the seventy-ninth day only from his departure ? 
The cause of the error is very simple . 
Phileas Fogg had , without suspecting it , gained one day on his journey , and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward ; he would , on the contrary , have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction , that is , westward . 
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . 
There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty-four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . 
In other words , while Phileas Fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times .
