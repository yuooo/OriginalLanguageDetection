Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him , that Jean Valjean felt all his former joy returning , his fears and anxieties dissipating , and he gazed at Cosette , saying : `` Oh ! 
what a kindly wound ! 
Oh ! 
what a good misfortune ! '' 
Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill , had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard . 
She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him the books which he desired . 
Generally they were books of travel . 
Jean Valjean was undergoing a new birth ; his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays ; the Luxembourg , the prowling young stranger , Cosette 's coldness , -- all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim . 
He had reached the point where he said to himself : `` I imagined all that . 
I am an old fool . ''
