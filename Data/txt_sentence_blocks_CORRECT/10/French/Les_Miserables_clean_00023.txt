One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity , and said to his sister , with a smile , `` There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou . '' 
When it was a question of charity , he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal , and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection . 
Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town ; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier , a wealthy and avaricious old man , who contrived to be , at one and the same time , an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian . 
This variety of man has actually existed . 
When the Bishop came to him , he touched his arm , `` You must give me something , M. le Marquis . '' 
The Marquis turned round and answered dryly , `` I have poor people of my own , Monseigneur . '' 
`` Give them to me , '' replied the Bishop . 
One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral : -- `` My very dear brethren , my good friends , there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in France which have but three openings ; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings , the door and one window ; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening , the door . 
And this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows . 
Just put poor families , old women and little children , in those buildings , and behold the fevers and maladies which result !
