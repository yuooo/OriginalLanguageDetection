There he sat , calmly waiting -- for what ? 
Did he still cherish hope ? 
Did he still believe , now that the door of this prison was closed upon him , that he would succeed ? 
However that may have been , Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table , and observed its advancing hands . 
Not a word escaped his lips , but his look was singularly set and stern . 
The situation , in any event , was a terrible one , and might be thus stated : if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined ; if he was a knave , he was caught . 
Did escape occur to him ? 
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ? 
Did he think of escaping from it ? 
Possibly ; for once he walked slowly around the room .
