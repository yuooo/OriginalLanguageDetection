What could hinder the poor canoe , followed by sea and watched from the shore , from succumbing before the end of the day ? 
Aramis , digging his hands into his gray hair with rage , invoked the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons . 
Calling to Porthos , who was doing more work than all the rollers - whether of flesh or wood - `` My friend , '' said he , `` our adversaries have just received a reinforcement . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Porthos , quietly , `` what is to be done , then ? '' 
`` To recommence the combat , '' said Aramis , `` is hazardous . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Porthos , `` for it is difficult to suppose that out of two , one should not be killed ; and certainly , if one of us was killed , the other would get himself killed also . '' 
Porthos spoke these words with that heroic nature which , with him , grew grander with necessity . 
Aramis felt it like a spur to his heart . 
`` We shall neither of us be killed if you do what I tell you , friend Porthos . ''
