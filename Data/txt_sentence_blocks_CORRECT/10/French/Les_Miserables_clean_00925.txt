Thus they passed Gournay and Neuilly-sur-Marne . 
Towards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles . 
The coachman drew up in front of the carters ' inn installed in the ancient buildings of the Royal Abbey , to give his horses a breathing spell . 
`` I get down here , '' said the man . 
He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle . 
An instant later he had disappeared . 
He did not enter the inn . 
When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later , it did not encounter him in the principal street of Chelles . 
The coachman turned to the inside travellers . 
`` There , '' said he , `` is a man who does not belong here , for I do not know him .
