It seemed to throw a light on M. Madeleine 's origin . 
It was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop . 
`` He has gone into mourning for the Bishop of D -- '' said the drawing-rooms ; this raised M. Madeleine 's credit greatly , and procured for him , instantly and at one blow , a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur M . 
The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine , the probable relative of a bishop . 
M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained , by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones . 
One evening , a ruler in that petty great world , who was curious by right of seniority , ventured to ask him , `` M. le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D -- ? '' 
He said , `` No , Madame . '' 
`` But , '' resumed the dowager , `` you are wearing mourning for him . '' 
He replied , `` It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth . '' 
Another thing which was remarked , was , that every time that he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep , the mayor had him summoned , inquired his name , and gave him money .
