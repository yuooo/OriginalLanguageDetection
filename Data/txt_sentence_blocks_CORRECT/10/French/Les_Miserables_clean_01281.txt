Jean Valjean , as in the first instance , contented himself with saying , `` Impossible . '' 
Fauchelevent grumbled , more to himself than to Jean Valjean : -- `` There is another thing which bothers me . 
I have said that I would put earth in it . 
When I come to think it over , the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing , it wo n't do , it will get displaced , it will move about . 
The men will bear it . 
You understand , Father Madeleine , the government will notice it . '' 
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving . 
Fauchelevent went on : -- `` How the de -- uce are you going to get out ? 
It must all be done by to-morrow morning . 
It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in .
