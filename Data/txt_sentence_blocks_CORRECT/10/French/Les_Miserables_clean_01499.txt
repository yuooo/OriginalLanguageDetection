A little peasant girl , all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle , was offering flowers to the travellers . 
`` Give your ladies flowers ! '' 
she cried . 
Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket . 
`` Come now , '' said Theodule , leaping down from the coupe , `` this piques my curiosity . 
Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to ? 
She must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet . 
I want to see her . '' 
And no longer in pursuance of orders , but from personal curiosity , like dogs who hunt on their own account , he set out to follow Marius . 
Marius paid no attention to Theodule .
