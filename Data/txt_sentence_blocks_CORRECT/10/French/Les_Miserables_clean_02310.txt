Four o'clock struck . 
Thenardier shuddered . 
A few moments later , that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison . 
The sound of doors opening and shutting , the creaking of gratings on their hinges , a tumult in the guard-house , the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys , the shock of musket-butts on the pavement of the courts , reached his ears . 
Lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories , a torch ran along the ridge-pole of the top story of the New Building , the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned . 
Their helmets , which the torch lighted up in the rain , went and came along the roofs . 
At the same time , Thenardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise . 
He was on top of a wall ten inches wide , stretched out under the heavy rains , with two gulfs to right and left , unable to stir , subject to the giddiness of a possible fall , and to the horror of a certain arrest , and his thoughts , like the pendulum of a clock , swung from one of these ideas to the other : `` Dead if I fall , caught if I stay . '' 
In the midst of this anguish , he suddenly saw , the street being still dark , a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavee , halt in the recess above which Thenardier was , as it were , suspended . 
Here this man was joined by a second , who walked with the same caution , then by a third , then by a fourth .
