The pavements were less hard to him than his mother 's heart . 
His parents had despatched him into life with a kick . 
He simply took flight . 
He was a boisterous , pallid , nimble , wide-awake , jeering , lad , with a vivacious but sickly air . 
He went and came , sang , played at hopscotch , scraped the gutters , stole a little , but , like cats and sparrows , gayly laughed when he was called a rogue , and got angry when called a thief . 
He had no shelter , no bread , no fire , no love ; but he was merry because he was free . 
When these poor creatures grow to be men , the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them , but so long as they are children , they escape because of their smallness . 
The tiniest hole saves them . 
Nevertheless , abandoned as this child was , it sometimes happened , every two or three months , that he said , `` Come , I 'll go and see mamma ! '' 
Then he quitted the boulevard , the Cirque , the Porte Saint-Martin , descended to the quays , crossed the bridges , reached the suburbs , arrived at the Salpetriere , and came to a halt , where ?
