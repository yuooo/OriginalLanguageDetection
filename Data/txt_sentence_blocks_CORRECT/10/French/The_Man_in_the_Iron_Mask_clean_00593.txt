This , then , was what had happened . 
The duke had no longer a dwelling-house - that had become useless to an admiral whose place of residence is his ship ; he had no longer need of superfluous arms , when he was placed amidst his cannons ; no more jewels , which the sea might rob him of ; but he had three or four hundred thousand crowns fresh in his coffers . 
And throughout the house there was a joyous movement of people who believed they were plundering monseigneur . 
The prince had , in a supreme degree , the art of making happy the creditors most to be pitied . 
Every distressed man , every empty purse , found in him patience and sympathy for his position . 
To some he said , `` I wish I had what you have ; I would give it you . '' 
And to others , `` I have but this silver ewer ; it is worth at least five hundred livres , - take it . '' 
The effect of which was - so truly is courtesy a current payment - that the prince constantly found means to renew his creditors . 
This time he used no ceremony ; it might be called a general pillage . 
He gave up everything .
