It is more than progress ; it is transmutation . 
Between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution . 
What has effected this revolution ? 
The man whom all the world forgets , and whom we have mentioned , Bruneseau . 
FUTURE PROGRESS The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task . 
The last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination , any more than they have been able to finish Paris . 
The sewer , in fact , receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris . 
Within the bosom of the earth , it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae , which expands below as the city expands above . 
Every time that the city cuts a street , the sewer stretches out an arm . 
The old monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred metres of sewers ; that was where Paris stood in this respect on the first of January , 1806 .
