Let us hear it , '' said Raoul , with a smile . 
`` The king has made me a duke , '' said the worthy Porthos , with an air of mystery , in the ear of the young man , `` a duke by brevet . '' 
But the asides of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by everybody . 
His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring . 
Athos heard him , and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start . 
The latter took Athos by the arm , and , after having asked Porthos 's permission to say a word to his friend in private , `` My dear Athos , '' he began , `` you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble . '' 
`` With grief and trouble , my dear friend ? '' 
cried the comte ; `` oh , what ? '' 
`` In two words . 
I have conspired against the king ; that conspiracy has failed , and , at this moment , I am doubtless pursued . ''
