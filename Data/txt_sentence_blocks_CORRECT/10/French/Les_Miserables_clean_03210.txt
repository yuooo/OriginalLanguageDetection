Accordingly , the marriage took place on the 16th , notwithstanding the public merrymaking . 
It rained that day , but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness , which lovers see , even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella . 
On the preceding evening , Jean Valjean handed to Marius , in the presence of M. Gillenormand , the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs . 
As the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property , the papers had been simple . 
Henceforth , Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean ; Cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of lady 's maid . 
As for Jean Valjean , a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house had been furnished expressly for him , and Cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner : `` Father , I entreat you , '' that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it . 
A few days before that fixed on for the marriage , an accident happened to Jean Valjean ; he crushed the thumb of his right hand . 
This was not a serious matter ; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it , nor to dress it , nor even to see his hurt , not even Cosette . 
Nevertheless , this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage , and to carry his arm in a sling , and had prevented his signing . 
M. Gillenormand , in his capacity of Cosette 's supervising-guardian , had supplied his place .
