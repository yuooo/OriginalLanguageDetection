Philippe , sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII. , your father , show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who , at this moment , has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to . '' 
With these words , Philippe , notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling , and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will , threw himself on the royal bed , and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis XIV . 
had lain , while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother 's tears . 
With his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow , Philippe perceived above him the crown of France , suspended , as we have stated , by angels with outspread golden wings . 
A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion 's den , but can hardly hope to sleep there quietly . 
Philippe listened attentively to every sound ; his heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror and misfortune ; but confident in his own strength , which was confirmed by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination , he waited until some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself . 
He hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him , like those phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle . 
But nothing approached . 
Silence , that mortal enemy of restless hearts , and of ambitious minds , shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king of France , who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown . 
Towards the morning a shadow , rather than a body , glided into the royal chamber ; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any surprise .
