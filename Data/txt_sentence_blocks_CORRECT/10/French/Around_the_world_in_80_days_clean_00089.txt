Passepartout was all eyes and ears . 
Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word . 
The Parsee jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket . 
He soon returned , saying : `` A procession of Brahmins is coming this way . 
We must prevent their seeing us , if possible . '' 
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . 
He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed . 
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer , and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals . 
The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees , a hundred paces away ; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches . 
First came the priests , with mitres on their heads , and clothed in long lace robes .
