We are all made so . 
Wrath , tempest , claps of thunder , foam to the very ceiling . 
A woman enters on the scene , a planet rises ; flat on your face ! 
Marius was fighting six months ago ; to-day he is married . 
That is well . 
Yes , Marius , yes , Cosette , you are in the right . 
Exist boldly for each other , make us burst with rage that we can not do the same , idealize each other , catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth , and arrange yourselves a nest for life . 
Pardi , to love , to be loved , what a fine miracle when one is young ! 
Do n't imagine that you have invented that . 
I , too , have had my dream , I , too , have meditated , I , too , have sighed ; I , too , have had a moonlight soul .
