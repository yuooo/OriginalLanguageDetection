All four were madly pretty . 
A good old classic poet , then famous , a good fellow who had an Eleonore , M. le Chevalier de Labouisse , as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud , saw them pass about ten o'clock in the morning , and exclaimed , `` There is one too many of them , '' as he thought of the Graces . 
Favourite , Blachevelle 's friend , the one aged three and twenty , the old one , ran on in front under the great green boughs , jumped the ditches , stalked distractedly over bushes , and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun . 
Zephine and Dahlia , whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together , and completed each other , never left each other , more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship , and clinging to each other , they assumed English poses ; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance , melancholy was dawning for women , as later on , Byronism dawned for men ; and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully . 
Zephine and Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls .

He was very gay , but one felt the force of government in him ; there was dictation in his joviality ; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen , with straps of braided copper wire ; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand , and , as he treated himself to everything , a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth . 
Nothing was sacred to him ; he smoked .
