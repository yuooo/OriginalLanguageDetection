In this box he hides a watch-spring , and this watch-spring , properly handled , cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron . 
The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou ; not at all , he possesses liberty . 
It was a large sou of this sort which , during the subsequent search of the police , was found under the bed near the window . 
They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou . 
It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him , that he contrived to conceal it in his hand , and that afterward , having his right hand free , he unscrewed it , and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him , which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which Marius had observed . 
As he had not been able to bend down , for fear of betraying himself , he had not cut the bonds of his left leg . 
The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise . 
`` Be easy , '' said Bigrenaille to Thenardier . 
`` He still holds by one leg , and he ca n't get away . 
I 'll answer for that .
