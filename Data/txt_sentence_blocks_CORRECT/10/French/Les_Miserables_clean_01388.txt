Light renders healthy . 
Light kindles . 
All generous social irradiations spring from science , letters , arts , education . 
Make men , make men . 
Give them light that they may warm you . 
Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth ; and then , those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have to make this choice ; the children of France or the gamins of Paris ; flames in the light or will-o ' - the-wisps in the gloom . 
The gamin expresses Paris , and Paris expresses the world . 
For Paris is a total . 
Paris is the ceiling of the human race . 
The whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living manners .
