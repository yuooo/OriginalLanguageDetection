`` Willingly , Monsieur Fix . 
We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon . '' 
SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview , though Fix was reserved , and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg . 
He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice ; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept Aouda company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist . 
Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing . 
It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person , whom he had first met at Suez , had then encountered on board the Mongolia , who disembarked at Bombay , which he announced as his destination , and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon , was following Mr. Fogg 's tracks step by step . 
What was Fix 's object ? 
Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes -- which he religiously preserved -- that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them , and probably on the same steamer . 
Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view . 
He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe .
