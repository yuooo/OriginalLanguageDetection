It was to this place the somber coffins were carried , attended by a silent and respectful crowd . 
The office of the dead being celebrated , the last adieux paid to the noble departed , the assembly dispersed , talking , along the roads , of the virtues and mild death of the father , of the hopes the son had given , and of his melancholy end upon the arid coast of Africa . 
Little by little , all noises were extinguished , like the lamps illuminating the humble nave . 
The minister bowed for the last time to the altar and the still fresh graves ; then , followed by his assistant , he slowly took the road back to the presbytery . 
D'Artagnan , left alone , perceived that night was coming on . 
He had forgotten the hour , thinking only of the dead . 
He arose from the oaken bench on which he was seated in the chapel , and wished , as the priest had done , to go and bid a last adieu to the double grave which contained his two lost friends . 
A woman was praying , kneeling on the moist earth . 
D'Artagnan stopped at the door of the chapel , to avoid disturbing her , and also to endeavor to find out who was the pious friend who performed this sacred duty with so much zeal and perseverance . 
The unknown had hidden her face in her hands , which were white as alabaster .
