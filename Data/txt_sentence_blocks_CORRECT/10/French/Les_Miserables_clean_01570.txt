France ? 
Why ? 
Because of Paris ? 
I have just told you my opinion of Athens . 
England ? 
Why ? 
Because of London ? 
I hate Carthage . 
And then , London , the metropolis of luxury , is the headquarters of wretchedness . 
There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone .
