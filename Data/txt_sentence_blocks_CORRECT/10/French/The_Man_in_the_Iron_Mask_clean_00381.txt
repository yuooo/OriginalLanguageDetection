`` At all events , you would not be able to burn the gardens , and that is the finest feature of the place . '' 
`` And yet , '' resumed Fouquet , thoughtfully , `` what was I saying ? 
Great heavens ! 
burn Vaux ! 
destroy my palace ! 
But Vaux is not mine ; these wonderful creations are , it is true , the property , as far as sense of enjoyment goes , of the man who has paid for them ; but as far as duration is concerned , they belong to those who created them . 
Vaux belongs to Lebrun , to Lenotre , to Pelisson , to Levau , to La Fontaine , to Moliere ; Vaux belongs to posterity , in fact . 
You see , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that my very house has ceased to be my own . '' 
`` That is all well and good , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` the idea is agreeable enough , and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it . 
That idea , indeed , makes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether ; and I now fail to recognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur .
