On this occasion , however , he had been caught unprepared . 
When donning his uniform of a National Guardsman on the preceding evening , he had forgotten , dolefully absorbed as he was , to take his pocket-book . 
He had only some small change in his fob . 
He turned out his pocket , all soaked with ooze , and spread out on the banquette of the vault one louis d'or , two five-franc pieces , and five or six large sous . 
Thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck . 
`` You knocked him over cheap , '' said he . 
He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius , with the greatest familiarity . 
Jean Valjean , who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light , let him have his way . 
While handling Marius ' coat , Thenardier , with the skill of a pickpocket , and without being noticed by Jean Valjean , tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse , probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve , later on , to identify the assassinated man and the assassin . 
However , he found no more than the thirty francs .
