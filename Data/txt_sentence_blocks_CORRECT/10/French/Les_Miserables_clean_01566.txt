A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra . 
It is a shame that I am ignorant , otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things ; but I know nothing . 
For instance , I have always been witty ; when I was a pupil of Gros , instead of daubing wretched little pictures , I passed my time in pilfering apples ; rapin -LSB- 24 -RSB- is the masculine of rapine . 
So much for myself ; as for the rest of you , you are worth no more than I am . 
I scoff at your perfections , excellencies , and qualities . 
Every good quality tends towards a defect ; economy borders on avarice , the generous man is next door to the prodigal , the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart ; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted ; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes ' cloak . 
Whom do you admire , the slain or the slayer , Caesar or Brutus ? 
Generally men are in favor of the slayer . 
Long live Brutus , he has slain ! 
There lies the virtue .
