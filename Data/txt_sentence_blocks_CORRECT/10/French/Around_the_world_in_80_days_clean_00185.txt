The pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda , happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea , ate with a good appetite , Fix being invited to share their repast , which he accepted with secret chagrin . 
To travel at this man 's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him . 
Still , he was obliged to eat , and so he ate . 
When the meal was over , he took Mr. Fogg apart , and said , `` sir '' -- this `` sir '' scorched his lips , and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this `` gentleman '' -- `` sir , you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat . 
But , though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you , I must ask to pay my share -- '' `` Let us not speak of that , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` But , if I insist -- '' `` No , sir , '' repeated Mr. Fogg , in a tone which did not admit of a reply . 
`` This enters into my general expenses . '' 
Fix , as he bowed , had a stifled feeling , and , going forward , where he ensconced himself , did not open his mouth for the rest of the day . 
Meanwhile they were progressing famously , and John Bunsby was in high hope .
