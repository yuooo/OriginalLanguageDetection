I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . ''
