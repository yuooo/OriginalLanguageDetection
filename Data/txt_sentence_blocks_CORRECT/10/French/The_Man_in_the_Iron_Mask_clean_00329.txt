`` Go and wake the governor , '' said the coachman in a voice of thunder . 
With the exception of this voice , which might have been heard at the entrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , everything remained as calm in the carriage as in the prison .

`` What is the matter now ? '' 
he asked ; `` and whom have you brought me there ? '' 
The man with the lantern opened the carriage-door , and said two or three words to the one who acted as driver , who immediately got down from his seat , took up a short musket which he kept under his feet , and placed its muzzle on his prisoner 's chest . 
`` And fire at once if he speaks ! '' 
added aloud the man who alighted from the carriage . 
`` Very good , '' replied his companion , without another remark .
