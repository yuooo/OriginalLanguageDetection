To-morrow is the fourth day of February , the fatal day , the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord ; if by this evening I have not paid my rent , to-morrow my oldest daughter , my spouse with her fever , my child with her wound , -- we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street , on the boulevard , without shelter , in the rain , in the snow . 
There , sir . 
I owe for four quarters -- a whole year ! 
that is to say , sixty francs . '' 
Jondrette lied . 
Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs , and he could not owe four , because six months had not elapsed since Marius had paid for two . 
M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table . 
Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter : -- `` The scoundrel ! 
What does he think I can do with his five francs ? 
That wo n't pay me for my chair and pane of glass !
