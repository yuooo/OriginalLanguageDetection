This plan would prove the safety of his friends . 
The blockade once raised , they might embark immediately , and set sail for England or Spain , without fear of being molested . 
Whilst they were making their escape , D'Artagnan would return to the king ; would justify his return by the indignation which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him ; he would be sent back with full powers , and he would take Belle-Isle ; that is to say , the cage , after the birds had flown . 
But to this plan the officer opposed a further order of the king 's . 
It was thus conceived : `` From the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving in his resignation , he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the expedition , and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to no longer obey him . 
Moreover , the said Monsieur d'Artagnan , having lost that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle , shall set out immediately for France , accompanied by the officer who will have remitted the message to him , and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he is answerable . '' 
Brave and careless as he was , D'Artagnan turned pale . 
Everything had been calculated with a depth of precognition which , for the first time in thirty years , recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible logic of the great cardinal . 
He leaned his head on his hand , thoughtful , scarcely breathing . 
`` If I were to put this order in my pocket , '' thought he , `` who would know it , what would prevent my doing it ?
