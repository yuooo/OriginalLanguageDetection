This road , through which Cosette had passed , excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary . 
Jean Valjean entered his lodgings . 
He lighted his candle and mounted the stairs . 
The apartment was empty . 
Even Toussaint was no longer there . 
Jean Valjean 's step made more noise than usual in the chambers . 
All the cupboards stood open . 
He penetrated to Cosette 's bedroom . 
There were no sheets on the bed . 
The pillow , covered with ticking , and without a case or lace , was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress , whose covering was visible , and on which no one was ever to sleep again .
