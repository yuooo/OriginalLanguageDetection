The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town . 
Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad , which runs directly east , and passes fifty stations . 
A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the station , and they only had time to get into the cars . 
They had seen nothing of Omaha ; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted , as they were not travelling to see the sights . 
The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa , by Council Bluffs , Des Moines , and Iowa City . 
During the night it crossed the Mississippi at Davenport , and by Rock Island entered Illinois . 
The next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached Chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan . 
Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York ; but trains are not wanting at Chicago . 
Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other , and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne , and Chicago Railway left at full speed , as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose . 
It traversed Indiana , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey like a flash , rushing through towns with antique names , some of which had streets and car-tracks , but as yet no houses .
