She seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age . 
On closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen . 
She was the child who had said , on the boulevard the evening before : `` I bolted , bolted , bolted ! '' 
She was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time , then suddenly starts up rapidly . 
It is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants . 
These creatures have neither childhood nor youth . 
At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve , at sixteen they seem twenty . 
To-day a little girl , to-morrow a woman . 
One might say that they stride through life , in order to get through with it the more speedily . 
At this moment , this being had the air of a child .
