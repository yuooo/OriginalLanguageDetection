`` D'Artagnan , beware of what you are doing ! '' 
`` For friendship 's sake , go ! '' 
and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet . 
`` Well , I will go , '' said Lyonne . 
D'Artagnan waited , walking about the corridor in no enviable mood . 
Lyonne returned . 
`` Well , what did the king say ? '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` He simply answered , '' Tis well , ' '' replied Lyonne . 
`` That it was well ! ''
