Another walk made the circuit of the garden , and skirted the white wall which enclosed it . 
These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box . 
In three of these , Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables ; in the fourth , the Bishop had planted some flowers ; here and there stood a few fruit-trees . 
Madame Magloire had once remarked , with a sort of gentle malice : `` Monseigneur , you who turn everything to account , have , nevertheless , one useless plot . 
It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets . '' 
`` Madame Magloire , '' retorted the Bishop , `` you are mistaken . 
The beautiful is as useful as the useful . '' 
He added after a pause , `` More so , perhaps . '' 
This plot , consisting of three or four beds , occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books . 
He liked to pass an hour or two there , trimming , hoeing , and making holes here and there in the earth , into which he dropped seeds .
