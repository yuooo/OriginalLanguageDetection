Here , he became dismayed , he did not wish to dig down , he did not wish to penetrate deeply ; he did not wish to sound himself . 
He had promised , he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise ; Jean Valjean held his promise ; one must keep one 's word even to a convict , above all to a convict . 
Still , his first duty was to Cosette . 
In short , he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him . 
Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind , passing from one to the other , and moved by all of them . 
Hence arose a profound trouble . 
It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette , but love is a talent , and Marius succeeded in doing it . 
However , without any apparent object , he questioned Cosette , who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing ; he talked of her childhood and her youth , and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good , paternal and respectable that a man can be towards Cosette . 
All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real . 
That sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily .
