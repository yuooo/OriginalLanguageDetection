To live in idleness on the property of society ! 
to be useless , that is to say , pernicious ! 
This leads straight to the depth of wretchedness . 
Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite ! 
He will become vermin ! 
Ah ! 
So it does not please you to work ? 
Ah ! 
You have but one thought , to drink well , to eat well , to sleep well . 
You will drink water , you will eat black bread , you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long , riveted to your limbs .
