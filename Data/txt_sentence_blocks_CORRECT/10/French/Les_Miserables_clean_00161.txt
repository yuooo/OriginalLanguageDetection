`` Who are you ? '' 
demanded the master of the house . 
The man replied : `` I have just come from Puy-Moisson . 
I have walked all day long . 
I have travelled twelve leagues . 
Can you ? 
-- if I pay ? '' 
`` I would not refuse , '' said the peasant , `` to lodge any respectable man who would pay me . 
But why do you not go to the inn ? '' 
`` There is no room . ''
