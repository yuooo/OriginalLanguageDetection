`` Where ? '' 
`` To a tailor 's . '' 
Such a visit was , indeed , opportune . 
The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and Fix was in rags , as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy . 
An hour after , they were once more suitably attired , and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel . 
Passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers . 
When he perceived Fix , he knit his brows ; but Aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression . 
Fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word . 
Dinner over , the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door . 
As he was getting in , Mr. Fogg said to Fix , `` You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again ? ''
