In a period of embarrassment , the first thing which does not sell is a Flora . 
The Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz stopped short . 
Weeks passed by without a single purchaser . 
Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Mother Plutarque sadly , `` it is the water-carrier . '' 
In short , one day , M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres , abdicated the functions of warden , gave up Saint-Sulpice , sold not a part of his books , but of his prints , -- that to which he was the least attached , -- and installed himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse , where , however , he remained but one quarter for two reasons : in the first place , the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs , and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent ; in the second , being near Faton 's shooting-gallery , he could hear the pistol-shots ; which was intolerable to him . 
He carried off his Flora , his copper-plates , his herbariums , his portfolios , and his books , and established himself near the Salpetriere , in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz , where , for fifty crowns a year , he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge , and containing a well . 
He took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture . 
On the day of his entrance into his new quarters , he was very gay , and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang , with his own hands , dug in his garden the rest of the day , and at night , perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air , and was very thoughtful , he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile : `` We have the indigo ! '' 
Only two visitors , the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius , were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz , a brawling name which was , to tell the truth , extremely disagreeable to him .
