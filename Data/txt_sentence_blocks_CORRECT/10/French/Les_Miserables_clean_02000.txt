These doctrines , these theories , these resistances , the unforeseen necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account , confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse , a new system of politics to be created , which shall be in accord with the old world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal , a situation in which it became necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac , the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt , the chambers and streets , the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him , his faith in the Revolution , perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right , his desire to remain of his race , his domestic spirit , his sincere respect for the people , his own honesty , preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully , and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was , he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king .

At intervals , deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud .
