Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air , Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort Kearney , the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions . 
But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg , and Passepartout was delighted with her decision ; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him . 
It would be difficult to guess the detective 's thoughts . 
Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg 's return , or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal , who , his journey round the world completed , would think himself absolutely safe in England ? 
Perhaps Fix 's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified ; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty , and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible . 
At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start . 
The passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks . 
The two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour . 
The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha , as the birds fly , is at most two hundred miles . 
If the wind held good , the distance might be traversed in five hours ; if no accident happened the sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock .
