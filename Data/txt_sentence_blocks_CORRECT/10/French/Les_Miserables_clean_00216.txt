In that heart , where there had been a wound , there was a scar . 
That is all . 
Only once , during all the time which he spent at Toulon , did he hear his sister mentioned . 
This happened , I think , towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity . 
I know not through what channels the news reached him . 
Some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister . 
She was in Paris . 
She lived in a poor street Rear Saint-Sulpice , in the Rue du Gindre . 
She had with her only one child , a little boy , the youngest . 
Where were the other six ?
