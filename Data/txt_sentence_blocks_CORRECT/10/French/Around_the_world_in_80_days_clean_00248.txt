The Salt Lake , seventy miles long and thirty-five wide , is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea . 
Quite different from Lake Asphaltite , whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea , it contains considerable salt , and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter , its specific weight being 1,170 , and , after being distilled , 1,000 . 
Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the Jordan , the Weber , and other streams soon perish . 
The country around the lake was well cultivated , for the Mormons are mostly farmers ; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals , fields of wheat , corn , and other cereals , luxuriant prairies , hedges of wild rose , clumps of acacias and milk-wort , would have been seen six months later . 
Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow . 
The train reached Ogden at two o'clock , where it rested for six hours , Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City , connected with Ogden by a branch road ; and they spent two hours in this strikingly American town , built on the pattern of other cities of the Union , like a checker-board , `` with the sombre sadness of right-angles , '' as Victor Hugo expresses it . 
The founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons . 
In this strange country , where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions , everything is done `` squarely '' -- cities , houses , and follies . 
The travellers , then , were promenading , at three o'clock , about the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs of the Wahsatch Range . 
They saw few or no churches , but the prophet 's mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts .
