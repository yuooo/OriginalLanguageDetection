Our hearts quiver so , and human life is such a mystery that , even in the case of a civic murder , even in a murder for liberation , if there be such a thing , the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race . '' 
And , such are the windings of the exchange of speech , that , a moment later , by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire 's verses , Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics , Raux with Cournand , Cournand with Delille , pointing out the passages translated by Malfilatre , particularly the prodigies of Caesar 's death ; and at that word , Caesar , the conversation reverted to Brutus . 
`` Caesar , '' said Combeferre , `` fell justly . 
Cicero was severe towards Caesar , and he was right . 
That severity is not diatribe . 
When Zoilus insults Homer , when Maevius insults Virgil , when Vise insults Moliere , when Pope insults Shakspeare , when Frederic insults Voltaire , it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out ; genius attracts insult , great men are always more or less barked at . 
But Zoilus and Cicero are two different persons . 
Cicero is an arbiter in thought , just as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword . 
For my own part , I blame that last justice , the blade ; but , antiquity admitted it . 
Caesar , the violator of the Rubicon , conferring , as though they came from him , the dignities which emanated from the people , not rising at the entrance of the senate , committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant , regia ac pene tyrannica .
