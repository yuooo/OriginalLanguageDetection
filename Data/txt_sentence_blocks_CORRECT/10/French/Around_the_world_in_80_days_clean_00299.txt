`` On foot ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` No ; on a sledge , '' replied Fix . 
`` On a sledge with sails . 
A man has proposed such a method to me . '' 
It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night , and whose offer he had refused . 
Phileas Fogg did not reply at once ; but Fix , having pointed out the man , who was walking up and down in front of the station , Mr. Fogg went up to him . 
An instant after , Mr. Fogg and the American , whose name was Mudge , entered a hut built just below the fort . 
There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . 
A high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail .
