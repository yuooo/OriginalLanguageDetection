`` Yes , Madame , '' replied the man , raising his hand to his hat . 
Wealthy travellers are not so polite . 
This gesture , and an inspection of the stranger 's costume and baggage , which the Thenardier passed in review with one glance , caused the amiable grimace to vanish , and the gruff mien to reappear . 
She resumed dryly : -- `` Enter , my good man . '' 
The `` good man '' entered . 
The Thenardier cast a second glance at him , paid particular attention to his frock-coat , which was absolutely threadbare , and to his hat , which was a little battered , and , tossing her head , wrinkling her nose , and screwing up her eyes , she consulted her husband , who was still drinking with the carters . 
The husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger , which , backed up by an inflation of the lips , signifies in such cases : A regular beggar . 
Thereupon , the Thenardier exclaimed : -- `` Ah ! 
see here , my good man ; I am very sorry , but I have no room left . '' 
`` Put me where you like , '' said the man ; `` in the attic , in the stable .
