That description is just , but incomplete . 
At the point of this story which we have now reached , a little of Father Fauchelevent 's physiology becomes useful . 
He was a peasant , but he had been a notary , which added trickery to his cunning , and penetration to his ingenuousness . 
Having , through various causes , failed in his business , he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer . 
But , in spite of oaths and lashings , which horses seem to require , something of the notary had lingered in him . 
He had some natural wit ; he talked good grammar ; he conversed , which is a rare thing in a village ; and the other peasants said of him : `` He talks almost like a gentleman with a hat . '' 
Fauchelevent belonged , in fact , to that species , which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois , demi-lout , and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian : rather rustic , rather citified ; pepper and salt . 
Fauchelevent , though sorely tried and harshly used by fate , worn out , a sort of poor , threadbare old soul , was , nevertheless , an impulsive man , and extremely spontaneous in his actions ; a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked . 
His defects and his vices , for he had some , were all superficial ; in short , his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer . 
His aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead , which signify malice or stupidity .
