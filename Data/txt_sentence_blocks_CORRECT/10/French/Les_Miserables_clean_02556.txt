Bahorel exclaimed : -- '' ` Flock ' ; a polite way of saying geese . '' 
And he tore the charge from the nail .

`` Bahorel , '' observed Enjolras , `` you are wrong . 
You should have let that charge alone , he is not the person with whom we have to deal , you are wasting your wrath to no purpose . 
Take care of your supply . 
One does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun . '' 
`` Each one in his own fashion , Enjolras , '' retorted Bahorel .
