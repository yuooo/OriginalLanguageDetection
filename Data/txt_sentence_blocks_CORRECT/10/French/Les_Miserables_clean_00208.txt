JEAN VALJEAN Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke . 
Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie . 
He had not learned to read in his childhood . 
When he reached man 's estate , be became a tree-pruner at Faverolles . 
His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu ; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean , probably a sobriquet , and a contraction of viola Jean , `` here 's Jean . '' 
Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures .

He had lost his father and mother at a very early age .
