Except Grimaud , who entered his chamber once , the musketeer saw neither servants nor guests . 
He supposed , from the noises in the house , and the continual coming and going , that preparations were being made for the funeral of the comte . 
He wrote to the king to ask for an extension of his leave of absence . 
Grimaud , as we have said , had entered D'Artagnan 's apartment , had seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door , like a man who meditates profoundly ; then , rising , he made a sign to D'Artagnan to follow him . 
The latter obeyed in silence . 
Grimaud descended to the comte 's bed-chamber , showed the captain with his finger the place of the empty bed , and raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven . 
`` Yes , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes , good Grimaud - now with the son he loved so much ! '' 
Grimaud left the chamber , and led the way to the hall , where , according to the custom of the province , the body was laid out , previously to being put away forever . 
D'Artagnan was struck at seeing two open coffins in the hall . 
In reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud , he approached , and saw in one of them Athos , still handsome in death , and , in the other , Raoul with his eyes closed , his cheeks pearly as those of the Palls of Virgil , with a smile on his violet lips .
