`` That is true . '' 
`` That plate - the prisoner has written something on it , has he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
I was afraid he had . '' 
And D'Artagnan , with all the marks of mortal disquietude , seized the plate , to read the inscription . 
When he had read it , a fearful pallor spread across his countenance . 
`` Oh ! 
good heavens ! '' 
repeated he .
