The cart was broken , and the horse was dead . 
Fauchelevent recovered , but his knee remained stiff . 
M. Madeleine , on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest , got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris . 
Some time afterwards , M. Madeleine was appointed mayor . 
The first time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town , he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master 's clothes . 
From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could . 
When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it , and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor , he addressed him with profound respect . 
This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had , besides the visible signs which we have mentioned , another symptom which was none the less significant for not being visible . 
This never deceives . 
When the population suffers , when work is lacking , when there is no commerce , the tax-payer resists imposts through penury , he exhausts and oversteps his respite , and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection .
