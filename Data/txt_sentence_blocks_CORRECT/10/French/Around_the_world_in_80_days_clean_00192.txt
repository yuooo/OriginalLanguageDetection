It was a favourable change , and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea , though the waves crossed each other , and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built . 
From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist , but no vessel was in sight . 
The Tankadere was alone upon the sea . 
There were some signs of a calm at noon , and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon . 
The tempest had been as brief as terrific . 
The passengers , thoroughly exhausted , could now eat a little , and take some repose . 
The night was comparatively quiet . 
Some of the sails were again hoisted , and the speed of the boat was very good . 
The next morning at dawn they espied the coast , and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai . 
A hundred miles , and only one day to traverse them !
