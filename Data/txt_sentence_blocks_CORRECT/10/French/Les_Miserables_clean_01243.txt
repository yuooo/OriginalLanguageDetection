`` Very well , speak . '' 
Goodman Fauchelevent , the ex-notary , belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance . 
A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force ; you do not distrust it , and you are caught by it . 
Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent . 
Always solitary and busied about his gardening , he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity . 
As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro , he saw before him only an agitation of shadows . 
By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh , and those corpses were alive for him . 
He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener , and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute . 
He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals , and he had succeeded , so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him ; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear . 
Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all ; that constituted his art .
