As he spoke thus , he did not advance a single step ; he hurled at Jean Valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook , and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him . 
It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously . 
At Javert 's exclamation , Fantine opened her eyes once more . 
But the mayor was there ; what had she to fear ? 
Javert advanced to the middle of the room , and cried : -- `` See here now ! 
Art thou coming ? '' 
The unhappy woman glanced about her . 
No one was present excepting the nun and the mayor . 
To whom could that abject use of `` thou '' be addressed ? 
To her only .
