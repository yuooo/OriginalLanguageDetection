Gavroche was staring into the air , apparently in search of something . 
He saw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him . 
Gavroche after staring into the air , stared below ; he raised himself on tiptoe , and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor ; they were all shut , bolted , and padlocked . 
After having authenticated the fronts of five or six barricaded houses in this manner , the urchin shrugged his shoulders , and took himself to task in these terms : -- `` Pardi ! '' 
Then he began to stare into the air again . 
Jean Valjean , who , an instant previously , in his then state of mind , would not have spoken to or even answered any one , felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child . 
`` What is the matter with you , my little fellow ? '' 
he said . 
`` The matter with me is that I am hungry , '' replied Gavroche frankly . 
And he added : `` Little fellow yourself . ''
