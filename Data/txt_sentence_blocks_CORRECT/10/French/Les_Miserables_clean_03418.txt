Not for too long , which might have proved embarrassing for the villain . 
The change was on sight , for a day or two , at the rate of thirty sous a day , by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible . 
This costumer was called `` the Changer '' ; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew him by no other . 
He had a tolerably complete wardrobe . 
The rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable . 
He had specialties and categories ; on each nail of his shop hung a social status , threadbare and worn ; here the suit of a magistrate , there the outfit of a Cure , beyond the outfit of a banker , in one corner the costume of a retired military man , elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters , and further on the dress of a statesman . 
This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris . 
His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged , and into which roguery retreated . 
A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room , deposited his thirty sous and selected , according to the part which he wished to play , the costume which suited him , and on descending the stairs once more , the knave was a somebody . 
On the following day , the clothes were faithfully returned , and the Changer , who trusted the thieves with everything , was never robbed .
