`` Why doubt me ? '' 
said Aramis . 
Fouquet smiled and shook his head . 
`` Man of little faith ! '' 
added the bishop . 
`` My dear M. d'Herblay , '' answered Fouquet , `` if I fall - '' `` Well ; if you ` fall ' ? '' 
`` I shall , at least , fall from such a height , that I shall shatter myself in falling . '' 
Then giving himself a shake , as though to escape from himself , `` Whence came you , '' said he , `` my friend ? '' 
`` From Paris - from Percerin . '' 
`` And what have you been doing at Percerin 's , for I suppose you attach no great importance to our poets ' dresses ? ''
