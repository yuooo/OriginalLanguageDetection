Thou hast willed it to be so , thyself . 
I have no longer the right even to weep . 
Thou hast chosen death ; it seemed to thee a preferable gift to life . '' 
At length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two gentlemen were to be given back to mother earth . 
There was such an affluence of military and other people that up to the place of the sepulture , which was a little chapel on the plain , the road from the city was filled with horsemen and pedestrians in mourning . 
Athos had chosen for his resting-place the little inclosure of a chapel erected by himself near the boundary of his estates . 
He had had the stones , cut in 1550 , brought from an old Gothic manor-house in Berry , which had sheltered his early youth . 
The chapel , thus rebuilt , transported , was pleasing to the eye beneath its leafy curtains of poplars and sycamores . 
It was ministered in every Sunday , by the cure of the neighboring bourg , to whom Athos paid an allowance of two hundred francs for this service ; and all the vassals of his domain , with their families , came thither to hear mass , without having any occasion to go to the city . 
Behind the chapel extended , surrounded by two high hedges of hazel , elder and white thorn , and a deep ditch , the little inclosure - uncultivated , though gay in its sterility ; because the mosses there grew thick , wild heliotrope and ravenelles there mingled perfumes , while from beneath an ancient chestnut issued a crystal spring , a prisoner in its marble cistern , and on the thyme all around alighted thousands of bees from the neighboring plants , whilst chaffinches and redthroats sang cheerfully among the flower-spangled hedges .
