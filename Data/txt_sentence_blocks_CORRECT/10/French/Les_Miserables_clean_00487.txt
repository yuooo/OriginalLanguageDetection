Nevertheless , she also was the prey to a strange confusion . 
She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers . 
She had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty , her life , her soul , her child , in combat before her very eyes ; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness , the other was leading her back towards the light . 
In this conflict , viewed through the exaggerations of terror , these two men had appeared to her like two giants ; the one spoke like her demon , the other like her good angel . 
The angel had conquered the demon , and , strange to say , that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel , this liberator , was the very man whom she abhorred , that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes , that Madeleine ! 
And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion , he had saved her ! 
Had she , then , been mistaken ? 
Must she change her whole soul ? 
She did not know ; she trembled . 
She listened in bewilderment , she looked on in affright , and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her , and something warm and ineffable , indescribable , which was both joy , confidence and love , dawn in her heart .
