A little beyond the barricade , it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him . 
He approached , it took on a form . 
It was two white horses ; the horses of the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning , who had been straying at random all day from street to street , and had finally halted there , with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men , than man understands the actions of Providence . 
Marius left the horses behind him . 
As he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social , a shot coming no one knows whence , and traversing the darkness at random , whistled close by him , and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser 's shop . 
This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848 , in the Rue du Contrat-Social , at the corner of the pillars of the market . 
This shot still betokened life . 
From that instant forth he encountered nothing more . 
The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps . 
Nevertheless , Marius pressed forward .
