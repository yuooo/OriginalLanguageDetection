These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful , and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale , which is between the class called `` middle '' and the class denominated as `` inferior , '' and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first , without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois . 
They were of those dwarfed natures which , if a dull fire chances to warm them up , easily become monstrous . 
There was in the woman a substratum of the brute , and in the man the material for a blackguard . 
Both were susceptible , in the highest degree , of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil . 
There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness , retrograding in life rather than advancing , employing experience to augment their deformity , growing incessantly worse , and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness . 
This man and woman possessed such souls . 
Thenardier , in particular , was troublesome for a physiognomist . 
One can only look at some men to distrust them ; for one feels that they are dark in both directions . 
They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front . 
There is something of the unknown about them .
