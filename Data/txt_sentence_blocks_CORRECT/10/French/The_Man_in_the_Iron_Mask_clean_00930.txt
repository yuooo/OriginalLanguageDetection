cried the Bretons , growing pale in turn . 
`` With Biscarrat at their head , mounted upon my gray horse , '' continued Aramis . 
The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche , and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries . 
`` Ah ! 
the devil ! '' 
said Aramis , resuming all his coolness at the sight of this certain , inevitable danger . 
`` I am perfectly satisfied we are lost , but we have , at least , one chance left . 
If the guards who follow their hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto , there is no help for us , for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat . 
The dogs must not go out of the cavern .
