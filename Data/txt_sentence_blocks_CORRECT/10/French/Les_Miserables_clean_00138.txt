However that may be , there are on earth men who -- are they men ? 
-- perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute , and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain . 
Monseigneur Welcome was one of these men ; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius . 
He would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even , like Swedenborg and Pascal , have slipped into insanity . 
Certainly , these powerful reveries have their moral utility , and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection . 
As for him , he took the path which shortens , -- the Gospel 's . 
He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah 's mantle ; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events ; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things ; he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him . 
This humble soul loved , and that was all . 
That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable : but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much ; and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts , Saint Theresa and Saint Jerome would be heretics . 
He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates .
