These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively , and with so touching an affection , and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side , each on the other 's account ; without acknowledging it to each other , without anger towards each other , and with a smile . 
THE CHAIN-GANG Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two . 
Youth , even in its sorrows , always possesses its own peculiar radiance . 
At times , Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile . 
It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear . 
He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him . 
He would have liked to resist , to retain her , to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter . 
These ideas , puerile , as we have just said , and at the same time senile , conveyed to him , by their very childishness , a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls . 
He once chanced to see a general on horseback , in full uniform , pass along the street , Comte Coutard , the commandant of Paris . 
He envied that gilded man ; what happiness it would be , he said to himself , if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing ; and if Cosette could behold him thus , she would be dazzled , and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries , the guard would present arms to him , and that would suffice for Cosette , and would dispel her idea of looking at young men .
