By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but did n't open their mouths nor look different nor interested . 
They squeaked through underneath . 
There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things . 
On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they war n't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath . 
This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth , with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it , and a painted border all around . 
It come all the way from Philadelphia , they said . 
There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table . 
One was a big family Bible full of pictures . 
One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why . 
I read considerable in it now and then .
