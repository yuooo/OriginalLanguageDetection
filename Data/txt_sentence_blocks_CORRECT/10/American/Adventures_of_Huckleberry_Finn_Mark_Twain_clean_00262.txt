says the bald-head . 
`` To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . '' 
And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag . 
`` Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? '' 
says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish . 
`` Yes , it IS good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high ? 
I did myself . 
I do n't blame YOU , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody . 
I deserve it all . 
Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me .
