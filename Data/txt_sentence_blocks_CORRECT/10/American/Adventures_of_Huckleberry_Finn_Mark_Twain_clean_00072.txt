I says to myself , they 'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me . 
And they 'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things . 
They wo n't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass . 
They 'll soon get tired of that , and wo n't bother no more about me . 
All right ; I can stop anywhere I want to . 
Jackson 's Island is good enough for me ; I know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there . 
And then I can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things I want . 
Jackson 's Island 's the place . 
I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep . 
When I woke up I did n't know where I was for a minute .
