I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ! 
do ye yet feel inclined for it ? '' 
`` I do , sir . '' 
`` Very good . 
Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale 's throat , and then jump after it ? 
Answer , quick ! '' 
`` I am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which I do n't take to be the fact . '' 
`` Good again . 
Now then , thou not only wantest to go a-whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ? 
Was not that what ye said ?
