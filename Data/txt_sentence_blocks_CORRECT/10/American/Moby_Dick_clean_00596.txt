Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail . 
In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil . 
If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible . 
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it . 
Your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result . 
These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child 's play . 
Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped . 
Third : I can not demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant 's trunk . 
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor 's whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all . 
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch !
