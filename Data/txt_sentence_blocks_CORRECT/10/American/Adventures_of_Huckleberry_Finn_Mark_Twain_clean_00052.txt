I was all over welts . 
He got to going away so much , too , and locking me in . 
Once he locked me in and was gone three days . 
It was dreadful lonesome . 
I judged he had got drowned , and I was n't ever going to get out any more . 
I was scared . 
I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there . 
I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but I could n't find no way . 
There war n't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through . 
I could n't get up the chimbly ; it was too narrow .
