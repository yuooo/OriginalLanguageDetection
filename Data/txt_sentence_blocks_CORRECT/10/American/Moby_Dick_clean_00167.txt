`` Very dim , very dim , '' said Elijah . 
`` Morning to ye . '' 
Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , `` See if you can find 'em now , will ye ? 
`` Find who ? '' 
`` Morning to ye ! 
morning to ye ! '' 
he rejoined , again moving off . 
`` Oh ! 
I was going to warn ye against -- but never mind , never mind -- it 's all one , all in the family too ; -- sharp frost this morning , ai n't it ?
