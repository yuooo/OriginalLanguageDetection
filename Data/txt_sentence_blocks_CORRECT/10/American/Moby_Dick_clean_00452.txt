cried Ahab . 
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . 
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers . 
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set . 
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up . 
`` There go flukes ! '' 
was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb 's producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted . 
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker 's boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture . 
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers . 
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use .
