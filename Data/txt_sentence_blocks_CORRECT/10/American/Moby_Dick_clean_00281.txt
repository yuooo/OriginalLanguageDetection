The white whale is their demigorgon . 
Hark ! 
the infernal orgies ! 
that revelry is forward ! 
mark the unfaltering silence aft ! 
Methinks it pictures life . 
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . 
The long howl thrills me through ! 
Peace ! 
ye revellers , and set the watch !
