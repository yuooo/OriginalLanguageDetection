Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me . 
I liked the old ways best , but I was getting so I liked the new ones , too , a little bit . 
The widow said I was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory . 
She said she war n't ashamed of me . 
One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast . 
I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but Miss Watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off . 
She says , `` Take your hands away , Huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making ! '' 
The widow put in a good word for me , but that war n't going to keep off the bad luck , I knowed that well enough . 
I started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be . 
There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this was n't one of them kind ; so I never tried to do anything , but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out .
