But all their pains seemed naught . 
Though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat -LRB- Ahab 's -RRB- did not escape . 
A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship 's high teetering side , stove in the boat 's bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve . 
`` Bad work , bad work ! 
Mr. Starbuck , '' said Stubb , regarding the wreck , `` but the sea will have its way . 
Stubb , for one , ca n't fight it . 
You see , Mr. Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring ! 
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here . 
But never mind ; it 's all in fun : so the old song says ; '' -- -LRB- sings . -RRB- 
Oh !
