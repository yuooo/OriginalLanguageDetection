Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , Purchas , Hackluyt , Harris , Cuvier , & c . 
But I pass that matter by . 
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett 's , Huggins 's , Frederick Cuvier 's , and Beale 's . 
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to . 
Huggins 's is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale 's is the best . 
All Beale 's drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . 
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect . 
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . 
That is not his fault though . 
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression .
