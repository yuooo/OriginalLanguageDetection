`` What ails ye , man ? '' 
cried Starbuck . 
`` Look-e here , '' said Queequeg , pointing down . 
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam . 
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped . 
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond . 
We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep . 
* * The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob : -- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that . 
When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter 's lance , the mother 's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods . 
The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries .
