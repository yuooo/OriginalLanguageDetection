Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape .

Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam . 
Good Lord ! 
is this the road that Jonah went ? 
The roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge-pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimitar-shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned . 
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the Right Whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time . 
In the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature 's age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings . 
Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability . 
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
