`` He 's more transparent ! '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
`` That from a doctor ! 
How one forgets ! 
Have you already forgotten your physics , in ten years ? 
Just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so . 
Paper , for instance , is made up of transparent fibres , and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque . 
Oil white paper , fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces , and it becomes as transparent as glass . 
And not only paper , but cotton fibre , linen fibre , wool fibre , woody fibre , and bone , Kemp , flesh , Kemp , hair , Kemp , nails and nerves , Kemp , in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair , are all made up of transparent , colourless tissue . 
So little suffices to make us visible one to the other .
