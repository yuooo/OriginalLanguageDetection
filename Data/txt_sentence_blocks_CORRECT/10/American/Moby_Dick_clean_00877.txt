bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ? 
Close ! 
stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God . 
By the green land ; by the bright hearthstone ! 
this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye . 
No , no ; stay on board , on board ! 
-- lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick . 
That hazard shall not be thine . 
No , no ! 
not with the far away home I see in that eye ! ''
