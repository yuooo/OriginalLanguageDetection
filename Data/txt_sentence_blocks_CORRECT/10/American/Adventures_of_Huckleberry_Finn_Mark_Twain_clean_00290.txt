Admission 25 cents ; children and servants , 10 cents . 
Then we went loafing around town . 
The stores and houses was most all old , shackly , dried up frame concerns that had n't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was over-flowed . 
The houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds , and sunflowers , and ash piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tinware . 
The fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every which way , and had gates that did n't generly have but one hinge -- a leather one . 
Some of the fences had been white - washed some time or another , but the duke said it was in Clumbus ' time , like enough . 
There was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out . 
All the stores was along one street . 
They had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts . 
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , whittling them with their Barlow knives ; and chawing tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretching -- a mighty ornery lot .
