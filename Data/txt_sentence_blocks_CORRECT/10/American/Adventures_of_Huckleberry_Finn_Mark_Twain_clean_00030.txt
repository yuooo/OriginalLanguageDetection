So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer 's lies . 
I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants , but as for me I think different . 
It had all the marks of a Sunday-school . 
WELL , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now . 
I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever . 
I do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway . 
At first I hated the school , but by and by I got so I could stand it . 
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey , and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up . 
So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be . 
I was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so raspy on me .
