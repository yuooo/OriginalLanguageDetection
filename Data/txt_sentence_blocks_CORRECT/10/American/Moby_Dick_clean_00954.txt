So fare thee well , poor devil of a Sub-Sub , whose commentator I am . 
Thou belongest to that hopeless , sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong ; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit , and feel poor-devilish , too ; and grow convivial upon tears ; and say to them bluntly , with full eyes and empty glasses , and in not altogether unpleasant sadness -- Give it up , Sub-Subs ! 
For by how much more pains ye take to please the world , by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless ! 
Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye ! 
But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts ; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens , and making refugees of long pampered Gabriel , Michael , and Raphael , against your coming . 
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together -- there , ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses ! 
`` And God created great whales . '' 
-- GENESIS . 
`` Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him ; One would think the deep to be hoary . '' 
-- JOB .
