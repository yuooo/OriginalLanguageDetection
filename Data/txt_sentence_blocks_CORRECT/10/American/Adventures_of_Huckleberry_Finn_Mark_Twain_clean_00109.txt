Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe , It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside . 
We went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way . 
Well , on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtles -- they would slide off in the water . 
The ridge our cavern was in was full of them . 
We could a had pets enough if we 'd wanted them . 
One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft -- nice pine planks . 
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inches -- a solid , level floor . 
We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we did n't show ourselves in daylight . 
Another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a frame-house down , on the west side . 
She was a two-story , and tilted over considerable .
