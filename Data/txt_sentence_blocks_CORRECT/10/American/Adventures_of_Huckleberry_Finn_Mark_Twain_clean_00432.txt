Say , gim me a chaw tobacker , wo n't ye ? '' 
I did n't have none , so he left . 
I went to the raft , and set down in the wigwam to think . 
But I could n't come to nothing . 
I thought till I wore my head sore , but I could n't see no way out of the trouble . 
After all this long journey , and after all we 'd done for them scoundrels , here it was all come to nothing , everything all busted up and ruined , because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that , and make him a slave again all his life , and amongst strangers , too , for forty dirty dollars . 
Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was , as long as he 'd GOT to be a slave , and so I 'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was . 
But I soon give up that notion for two things : she 'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her , and so she 'd sell him straight down the river again ; and if she did n't , everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger , and they 'd make Jim feel it all the time , and so he 'd feel ornery and disgraced . 
And then think of ME ! 
It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I 'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame .
