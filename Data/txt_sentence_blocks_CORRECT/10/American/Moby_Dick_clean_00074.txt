That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers ! 
the contraband was Jonah . 
But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden . 
A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . 
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah 's head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep . 
He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him . 
Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep . 
But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ` What meanest thou , O , sleeper ! 
arise ! ' 
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea .
