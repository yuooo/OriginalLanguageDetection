-- then I 'll hop with ye ; yea , turn grasshopper ! 
LONG-ISLAND SAILOR Well , well , ye sulkies , there 's plenty more of us . 
Hoe corn when you may , say I. All legs go to harvest soon . 
Ah ! 
here comes the music ; now for it ! 
AZORE SAILOR -LRB- Ascending , and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle . -RRB- 
Here you are , Pip ; and there 's the windlass-bits ; up you mount ! 
Now , boys ! 
-LRB- The half of them dance to the tambourine ; some go below ; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging . 
Oaths a-plenty . -RRB-
