`` They did n't do nothing . 
And they did n't act anyway much , as fur as I see . 
They tiptoed away ; so I seen , easy enough , that they 'd shoved in there to do up your majesty 's room , or something , s ` posing you was up ; and found you WAR N'T up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they had n't already waked you up . '' 
`` Great guns , THIS is a go ! '' 
says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly . 
They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : `` It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand . 
They let on to be SORRY they was going out of this region ! 
And I believed they WAS sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody . 
Do n't ever tell ME any more that a nigger ai n't got any histrionic talent . 
Why , the way they played that thing it would fool ANYBODY .
