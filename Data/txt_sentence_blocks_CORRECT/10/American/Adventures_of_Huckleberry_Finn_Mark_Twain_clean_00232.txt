He was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family . 
He was well born , as the saying is , and that 's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the Widow Douglas said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he war n't no more quality than a mudcat himself . 
Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim , and had a darkish-paly complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say . 
His forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders . 
His hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it . 
He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it . 
There war n't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud . 
He was as kind as he could be -- you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence . 
Sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards . 
He did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners -- everybody was always good-mannered where he was .
