But this fine young savage -- this sea Prince of Wales , never saw the Captain 's cabin . 
They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him . 
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen . 
For at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were . 
But , alas ! 
the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father 's heathens . 
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost . 
Thought he , it 's a wicked world in all meridians ; I 'll die a pagan . 
And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish . 
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home .
