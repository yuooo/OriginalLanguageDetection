`` Take the bucket , will ye , Archy ? 
what noise d'ye mean ? '' 
`` There it is again -- under the hatches -- do n't you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough . '' 
`` Cough be damned ! 
Pass along that return bucket . '' 
`` There again -- there it is ! 
-- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now ! '' 
`` Caramba ! 
have done , shipmate , will ye ? 
It 's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else .
