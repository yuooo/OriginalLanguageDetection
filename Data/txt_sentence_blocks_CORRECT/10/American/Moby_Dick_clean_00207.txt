Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , `` I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir . ''

gritted Ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some passionate temptation . 
`` No , sir ; not yet , '' said Stubb , emboldened , `` I will not tamely be called a dog , sir . '' 
`` Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I 'll clear the world of thee ! '' 
As he said this , Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that Stubb involuntarily retreated . 
`` I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it , '' muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle .
