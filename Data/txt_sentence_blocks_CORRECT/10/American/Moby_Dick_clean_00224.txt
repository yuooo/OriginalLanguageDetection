My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology . 
I am the architect , not the builder . 
But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it . 
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one 's hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing . 
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! 
The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me . 
`` Will he -LRB- the leviathan -RRB- make a covenant with thee ? 
Behold the hope of him is vain ! 
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try . 
There are some preliminaries to settle .
