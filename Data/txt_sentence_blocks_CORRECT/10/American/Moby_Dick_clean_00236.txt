The Specksynder Concerning the officers of the whale-craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet . 
The large importance attached to the harpooneer 's vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale-ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder . 
Literally this word means Fat-Cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer . 
In those days , the captain 's authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns , the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme . 
In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged . 
At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain 's more inferior subalterns . 
Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances -LRB- night watches on a whaling ground -RRB- the command of the ship 's deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .
