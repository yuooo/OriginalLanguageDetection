I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved . 
The greenhorn had gone down . 
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant 's glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared . 
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form . 
The boat soon picked them up . 
The poor bumpkin was restored . 
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon . 
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive . 
Was there ever such unconsciousness ? 
He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies .
