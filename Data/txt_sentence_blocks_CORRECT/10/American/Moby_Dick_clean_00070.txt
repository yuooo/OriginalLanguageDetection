Oh ! 
how that harmless question mangles Jonah ! 
For the instant he almost turns to flee again . 
But he rallies . ' 
I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ? ' 
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance . 
` We sail with the next coming tide , ' at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him . 
` No sooner , sir ? ' 
-- ` Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger . ' 
Ha !
