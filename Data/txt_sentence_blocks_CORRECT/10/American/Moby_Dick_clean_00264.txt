Look ! 
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . 
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! 
The crew , man , the crew ! 
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ? 
See Stubb ! 
he laughs ! 
See yonder Chilian ! 
he snorts to think of it . 
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling can not , Starbuck !
