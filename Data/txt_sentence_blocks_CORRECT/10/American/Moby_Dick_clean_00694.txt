Aye , aye -- they were mine -- my irons , '' cried Ahab , exultingly -- `` but on ! '' 
`` Give me a chance , then , '' said the Englishman , good-humoredly . 
`` Well , this old great-grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line ! 
`` Aye , I see ! 
-- wanted to part it ; free the fast-fish -- an old trick -- I know him . '' 
`` How it was exactly , '' continued the one-armed commander , `` I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we did n't know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump ! 
instead of the other whale 's ; that went off to windward , all fluking . 
Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest I ever saw , sir , in my life -- I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in . 
And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw -LRB- for I have a devil of a boat 's crew for a pull on a whale-line -RRB- ; seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate 's boat -- Mr. Mounttop 's here -LRB- by the way , Captain -- Mounttop ; Mounttop -- the captain -RRB- ; -- as I was saying , I jumped into Mounttop 's boat , which , d'ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great-grandfather have it . 
But , Lord , look you , sir -- hearts and souls alive , man -- the next instant , in a jiff , I was blind as a bat -- both eyes out -- all befogged and bedeadened with black foam -- the whale 's tail looming straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble steeple .
