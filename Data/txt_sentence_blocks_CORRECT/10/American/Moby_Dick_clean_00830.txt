the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon ; the tugging log was gone . 
`` I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log-line . 
But Ahab can mend all . 
Haul in here , Tahitian ; reel up , Manxman . 
And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line . 
See to it . '' 
`` There he goes now ; to him nothing 's happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world . 
Haul in , haul in , Tahitian ! 
These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow . 
Ha , Pip ?
