The doubloon goes a-begging ! 
See the sun ! 
Aye , aye , it must be so . 
I 've over-sailed him . 
How , got the start ? 
Aye , he 's chasing me now ; not I , him -- that 's bad ; I might have known it , too . 
Fool ! 
the lines -- the harpoons he 's towing . 
Aye , aye , I have run him by last night . 
About !
