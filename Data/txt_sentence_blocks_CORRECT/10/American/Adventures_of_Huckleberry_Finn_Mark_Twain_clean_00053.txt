The door was thick , solid oak slabs . 
Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , I was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time . 
But this time I found something at last ; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle ; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof . 
I greased it up and went to work . 
There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out . 
I got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through . 
Well , it was a good long job , but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap 's gun in the woods . 
I got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in . 
Pap war n't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self . 
He said he was down town , and everything was going wrong .
