`` Come back here , cook ; -- here , hand me those tongs ; -- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? 
Take it , I say '' -- holding the tongs towards him -- `` take it , and taste it . '' 
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , `` Best cooked ` teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy . '' 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; `` do you belong to the church ? '' 
`` Passed one once in Cape-Down , '' said the old man sullenly . 
`` And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures , have you , cook ! 
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Where do you expect to go to , cook ? '' 
`` Go to bed berry soon , '' he mumbled , half-turning as he spoke .
