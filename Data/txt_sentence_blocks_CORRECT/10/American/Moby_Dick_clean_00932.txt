Future things swim before me , as in empty outlines and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim . 
Mary , girl ; thou fadest in pale glories behind me ; boy ! 
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue . 
Strangest problems of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between -- Is my journey 's end coming ? 
My legs feel faint ; like his who has footed it all day . 
Feel thy heart , -- beats it yet ? 
Stir thyself , Starbuck ! 
-- stave it off -- move , move ! 
speak aloud ! 
-- Mast-head there !
