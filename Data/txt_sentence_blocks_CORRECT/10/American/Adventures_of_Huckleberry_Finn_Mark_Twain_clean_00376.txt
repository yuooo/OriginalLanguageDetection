`` No -- leastways , not all at once -- that is , I do n't think I ever see them all come OUT at once but just one time . '' 
`` Hello ! 
When was that ? '' 
`` It was the day we had the funeral . 
In the morning . 
It war n't early , because I overslept . 
I was just starting down the ladder , and I see them . '' 
`` Well , go on , GO on ! 
What did they do ? 
How 'd they act ? ''
