He jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as I shoved off , he says : `` Pooty soon I 'll be a-shout 'n' for joy , en I 'll say , it 's all on accounts o ' Huck ; I 's a free man , en I could n't ever ben free ef it hadn ' ben for Huck ; Huck done it . 
Jim wo n't ever forgit you , Huck ; you 's de bes ' fren ' Jim 's ever had ; en you 's de ONLY fren ' ole Jim 's got now . '' 
I was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me . 
I went along slow then , and I war n't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I war n't . 
When I was fifty yards off , Jim says : `` Dah you goes , de ole true Huck ; de on ' y white genlman dat ever kep ' his promise to ole Jim . '' 
Well , I just felt sick . 
But I says , I GOT to do it -- I ca n't get OUT of it . 
Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and I stopped . 
One of them says : `` What 's that yonder ? '' 
`` A piece of a raft , '' I says .
