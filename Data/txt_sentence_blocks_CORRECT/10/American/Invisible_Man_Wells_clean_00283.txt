`` That 's it ! 
Art pots . 
Well , I turned at the top step and swung round , plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me . 
The whole pile of pots went headlong , and I heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts . 
I made a mad rush for the refreshment place , and there was a man in white like a man cook , who took up the chase . 
I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery . 
I went behind the counter of this , and waited for my cook , and as he bolted in at the head of the chase , I doubled him up with a lamp . 
Down he went , and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could . 
Coat , jacket , trousers , shoes were all right , but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin . 
I heard more men coming , my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter , stunned or scared speechless , and I had to make another dash for it , like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile . ''
