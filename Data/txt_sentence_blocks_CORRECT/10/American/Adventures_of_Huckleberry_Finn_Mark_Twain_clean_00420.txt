Jim said it was so ; and the king told him to shut up , and said , `` Oh , yes , it 's MIGHTY likely ! '' 
and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he 'd drownd me . 
But the duke says : `` Leggo the boy , you old idiot ! 
Would YOU a done any different ? 
Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose ? 
I do n't remember it . '' 
So the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it . 
But the duke says : `` You better a blame ' sight give YOURSELF a good cussing , for you 're the one that 's entitled to it most . 
You hai n't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark . 
That WAS bright -- it was right down bully ; and it was the thing that saved us .
