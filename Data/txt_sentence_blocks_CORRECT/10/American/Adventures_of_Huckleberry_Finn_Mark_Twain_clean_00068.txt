Nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell . 
So he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three . 
I judged he would n't come back that night . 
I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start ; then I out with my saw , and went to work on that log again . 
Before he was t ` other side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder . 
I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky-jug . 
I took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; I took the wadding ; I took the bucket and gourd ; I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffee-pot . 
I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent . 
I cleaned out the place . 
I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that .
