His father was a High Chief , a King ; his uncle a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors . 
There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth . 
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father 's bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands . 
But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father 's influence could prevail . 
But Queequeg vowed a vow . 
Alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island . 
On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water . 
Hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring-bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces . 
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was the son of a King , and Queequeg budged not . 
Struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit Christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home .
