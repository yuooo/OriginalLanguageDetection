And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along . 
I 'll go and stuff the straw into Jim 's clothes to represent his mother in disguise , and be ready to BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get there . '' 
So out he went , and down cellar went I . 
The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn - pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : `` You been down cellar ? '' 
`` Yes 'm . '' 
`` What you been doing down there ? '' 
`` Noth ` n. '' `` NOTH ` N ! '' 
`` No 'm . '' 
`` Well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night ? ''
