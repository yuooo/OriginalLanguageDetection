Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . 
We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . 
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . 
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length . 
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship 's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern . 
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board . 
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time . 
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing , -- an oar or a lance pole . 
The Hyena There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody 's expense but his own . 
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing .
