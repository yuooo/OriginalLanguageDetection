`` Thou art too damned jolly . 
Sail on . 
Hast lost any men ? '' 
`` Not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that 's all ; -- but come aboard , old hearty , come along . 
I 'll soon take that black from your brow . 
Come along , will ye -LRB- merry 's the play -RRB- ; a full ship and homeward-bound . '' 
`` How wondrous familiar is a fool ! '' 
muttered Ahab ; then aloud , `` Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou sayest ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and outward-bound . 
So go thy ways , and I will mine . 
Forward there !
