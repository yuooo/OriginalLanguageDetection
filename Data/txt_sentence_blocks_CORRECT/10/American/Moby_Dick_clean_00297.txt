Ah me ! 
-- not thou nor I can bear the change ! 
How then , if so be transplanted to yon sky ? 
Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee 's peak of spears , when they leap down the crags and drown the villages ? 
-- The blast , the blast ! 
Up , spine , and meet it ! 
-LRB- Leaps to his feet . -RRB- 
PORTUGUESE SAILOR How the sea rolls swashing ` gainst the side ! 
Stand by for reefing , hearties ! 
the winds are just crossing swords , pell-mell they 'll go lunging presently .
