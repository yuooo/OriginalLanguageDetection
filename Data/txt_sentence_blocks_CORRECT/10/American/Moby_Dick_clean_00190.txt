But after embattling his facts , an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise , which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate , would he not be blame-worthy ? 
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through . 
There is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a caster of state . 
How they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ? 
Certain I am , however , that a king 's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad . 
Can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ? 
Much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and palpably smells of that anointing . 
In truth , a mature man who uses hairoil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere . 
As a general rule , he ca n't amount to much in his totality . 
But the only thing to be considered here is this -- what kind of oil is used at coronations ?
