Adye desisted and thought . 
`` Where I go , '' he said slowly , `` is my own business . '' 
The words were still on his lips , when an arm came round his neck , his back felt a knee , and he was sprawling backward . 
He drew clumsily and fired absurdly , and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip . 
He made a vain clutch at a slippery limb , tried to struggle up and fell back . 
`` Damn ! '' 
said Adye . 
The Voice laughed . 
`` I 'd kill you now if it was n't the waste of a bullet , '' it said . 
He saw the revolver in mid-air , six feet off , covering him .
