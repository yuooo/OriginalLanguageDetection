Well , then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there . 
So , says I , I 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me I 'll give them a show . 
I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have , and I war n't disappointed . 
A big double loaf come along , and I most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further . 
Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore -- I knowed enough for that . 
But by and by along comes another one , and this time I won . 
I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in . 
It was `` baker 's bread '' -- what the quality eat ; none of your low-down corn-pone . 
I got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat , and very well satisfied . 
And then something struck me .
