Being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom . 
On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats . 
In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences . 
When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow 's - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him -LRB- also fixed in the rack -RRB- , together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing . 
Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow 's - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow 's - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the `` local attraction '' of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship 's planks , and in the Glacier 's case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned `` binnacle deviations , '' `` azimuth compass observations , '' and `` approximate errors , '' he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow 's nest , within easy reach of his hand . 
Though , upon the whole , I greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird 's nest within three or four perches of the pole . 
But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float . 
For one , I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg , or any one else off duty whom I might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination . 
Let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard . 
With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I -- being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships ' standing orders , `` Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time . ''
