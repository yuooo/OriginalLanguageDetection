They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance . 
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came . 
In some things you would think them but a few hours old . 
Look there ! 
that chap strutting round the corner . 
He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat , girdled with a sailor-belt and a sheath-knife . 
Here comes another with a sou ' - wester and a bombazine cloak . 
No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one -- I mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog-days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands . 
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale-fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport . 
In bespeaking his sea-outfit , he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers .
