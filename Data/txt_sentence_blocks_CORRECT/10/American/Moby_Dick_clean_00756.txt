No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee-way adown the dim ages . 
Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg 's bidding , whatever it might include . 
There was some heathenish , coffin-colored old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made . 
No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg 's measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking Queequeg 's person as he shifted the rule . 
`` Ah ! 
poor fellow ! 
he 'll have to die now , '' ejaculated the Long Island sailor . 
Going to his vice-bench , the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference , now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities . 
This done , he marshalled the planks and his tools , and to work . 
When the last nail was driven , and the lid duly planed and fitted , he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction .
