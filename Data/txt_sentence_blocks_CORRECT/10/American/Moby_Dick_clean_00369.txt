Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks . 
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . 
`` Give way , men , '' whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; `` there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . 
There 's white water again ! 
-- close to ! 
Spring ! '' 
Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said : `` Stand up ! '' 
and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet . 
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter . 
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents .
