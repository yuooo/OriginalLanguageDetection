Consider ! 
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . 
Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . 
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . 
And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship 's deck , such is then the outlandish , eel-like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch . 
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form . 
Not at all . 
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape . 
Though Jeremy Bentham 's skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy 's other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan 's articulated bones . 
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .
