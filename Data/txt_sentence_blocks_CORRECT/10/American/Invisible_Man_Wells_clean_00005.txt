As she did so her visitor moved quickly , so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table . 
It would seem he was picking something from the floor . 
She rapped down the mustard pot on the table , and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire , and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender . 
She went to these things resolutely . 
`` I suppose I may have them to dry now , '' she said in a voice that brooked no denial . 
`` Leave the hat , '' said her visitor , in a muffled voice , and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her . 
For a moment she stood gaping at him , too surprised to speak . 
He held a white cloth -- it was a serviette he had brought with him -- over the lower part of his face , so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden , and that was the reason of his muffled voice . 
But it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall . 
It was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage , and that another covered his ears , leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink , peaked nose .
