Aye , aye ; and powder in the pan ; -- that 's not good . 
Best spill it ? 
-- wait . 
I 'll cure myself of this . 
I 'll hold the musket boldly while I think . 
-- I come to report a fair wind to him . 
But how fair ? 
Fair for death and doom , -- that 's fair for Moby Dick . 
It 's a fair wind that 's only fair for that accursed fish . 
-- The very tube he pointed at me !
