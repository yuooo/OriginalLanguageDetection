Well , I could n't HAVE it that way ; it would n't do at all . 
I must go up the road and waylay him . 
So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage . 
The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me . 
SO I started for town in the wagon , and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer , and I stopped and waited till he come along . 
I says `` Hold on ! '' 
and it stopped alongside , and his mouth opened up like a trunk , and stayed so ; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that 's got a dry throat , and then says : `` I hai n't ever done you no harm . 
You know that . 
So , then , what you want to come back and ha ` nt ME for ? '' 
I says : `` I hai n't come back -- I hai n't been GONE . ''
