So fur , so good . 
Your uncle Harvey 's a preacher , ai n't he ? 
Very well , then ; is a PREACHER going to deceive a steamboat clerk ? 
is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK ? 
-- so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard ? 
Now YOU know he ai n't . 
What WILL he do , then ? 
Why , he 'll say , ` It 's a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps , and so it 's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she 's got it . ' 
But never mind , if you think it 's best to tell your uncle Harvey -- '' `` Shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane 's got it or not ? 
Why , you talk like a muggins . ''
