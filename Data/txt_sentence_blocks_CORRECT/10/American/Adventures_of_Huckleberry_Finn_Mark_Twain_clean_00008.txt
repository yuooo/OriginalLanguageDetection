WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads . 
When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise . 
We scrouched down and laid still . 
Miss Watson 's big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him . 
He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening . 
Then he says : `` Who dah ? '' 
He listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly . 
Well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together . 
There was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but I das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders . 
Seemed like I 'd die if I could n't scratch .
