Somebody sings out : `` Boggs ! '' 
I looked over there to see who said it , and it was that Colonel Sherburn . 
He was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right hand -- not aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky . 
The same second I see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her . 
Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level -- both barrels cocked . 
Boggs throws up both of his hands and says , `` O Lord , do n't shoot ! '' 
Bang ! 
goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the air -- bang ! 
goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out . 
That young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , `` Oh , he 's killed him , he 's killed him ! ''
