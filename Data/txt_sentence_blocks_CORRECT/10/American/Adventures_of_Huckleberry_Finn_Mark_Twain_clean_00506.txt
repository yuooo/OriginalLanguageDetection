When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod , but he could n't come it , his hands was so sore . 
At last he says : `` It ai n't no use , it ca n't be done . 
What you reckon I better do ? 
Ca n't you think of no way ? '' 
`` Yes , '' I says , `` but I reckon it ai n't regular . 
Come up the stairs , and let on it 's a lightning-rod . '' 
So he done it . 
Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house , for to make some pens for Jim out of , and six tallow candles ; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance , and stole three tin plates . 
Tom says it was n't enough ; but I said nobody would n't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out , because they 'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole -- then we could tote them back and he could use them over again . 
So Tom was satisfied .
