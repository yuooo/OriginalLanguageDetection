By and by Tom says : `` Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before ! 
I bet I know where Jim is . '' 
`` No ! 
Where ? '' 
`` In that hut down by the ash-hopper . 
Why , looky here . 
When we was at dinner , did n't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What did you think the vittles was for ? '' 
`` For a dog . ''
