`` Sink him ! 
I never look at him at all ; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , Flask '' -- pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands -- `` Aye , will I ! 
Flask , I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise . 
Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ? 
He 's the devil , I say . 
The reason why you do n't see his tail , is because he tucks it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , I guess . 
Blast him ! 
now that I think of it , he 's always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots . '' 
`` He sleeps in his boots , do n't he ? 
He has n't got any hammock ; but I 've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging . ''
