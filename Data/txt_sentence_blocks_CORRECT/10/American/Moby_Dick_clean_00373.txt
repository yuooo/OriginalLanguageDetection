He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints .

I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman 's discretion ? ''

I 've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn . ''
