This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown . 
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb . 
This fin has four regular bone-fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger . 
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering . 
`` However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , '' said humorous Stubb one day , `` he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens . '' 
For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . 
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness . 
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . 
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . 
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan .
