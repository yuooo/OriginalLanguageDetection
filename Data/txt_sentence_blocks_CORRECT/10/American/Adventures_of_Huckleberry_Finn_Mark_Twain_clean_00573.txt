But he was sleeping , and sleeping very peaceful , too ; and pale , not fire - faced the way he was when he come . 
So I set down and laid for him to wake . 
In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in , and there I was , up a stump again ! 
She motioned me to be still , and set down by me , and begun to whisper , and said we could all be joyful now , because all the symptoms was first-rate , and he 'd been sleeping like that for ever so long , and looking better and peacefuller all the time , and ten to one he 'd wake up in his right mind . 
So we set there watching , and by and by he stirs a bit , and opened his eyes very natural , and takes a look , and says : `` Hello ! 
-- why , I 'm at HOME ! 
How 's that ? 
Where 's the raft ? '' 
`` It 's all right , '' I says . 
`` And JIM ? ''
