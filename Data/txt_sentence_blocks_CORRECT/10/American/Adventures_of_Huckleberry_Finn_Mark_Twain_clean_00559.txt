I says : `` Oh , you need n't be afeard , sir , she carried the three of us easy enough . '' 
`` What three ? '' 
`` Why , me and Sid , and -- and -- and THE GUNS ; that 's what I mean . '' 
`` Oh , '' he says . 
But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her , and shook his head , and said he reckoned he 'd look around for a bigger one . 
But they was all locked and chained ; so he took my canoe , and said for me to wait till he come back , or I could hunt around further , or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to . 
But I said I did n't ; so I told him just how to find the raft , and then he started . 
I struck an idea pretty soon . 
I says to myself , spos 'n he ca n't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep 's tail , as the saying is ? 
spos 'n it takes him three or four days ?
