Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood . 
`` That drove the spigot out of him ! '' 
cried Stubb . '' 
'T is July 's immortal Fourth ; all fountains must run wine today ! 
Would now , it were old Orleans whiskey , or old Ohio , or unspeakable old Monongahela ! 
Then , Tashtego , lad , I 'd have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we 'd drink round it ! 
Yea , verily , hearts alive , we 'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there , and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff . '' 
Again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash . 
The agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow-line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die . 
The Fountain That for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute -LRB- fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December , A.D. 1851 -RRB- , it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapor -- this is surely a noteworthy thing .
