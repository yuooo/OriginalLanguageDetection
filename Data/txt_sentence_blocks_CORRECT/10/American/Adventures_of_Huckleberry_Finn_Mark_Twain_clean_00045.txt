I never see such a son . 
I bet I 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before I 'm done with you . 
Why , there ai n't no end to your airs -- they say you 're rich . 
Hey ? 
-- how 's that ? '' 
`` They lie -- that 's how . '' 
`` Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass . 
I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich . 
I heard about it away down the river , too . 
That 's why I come .
