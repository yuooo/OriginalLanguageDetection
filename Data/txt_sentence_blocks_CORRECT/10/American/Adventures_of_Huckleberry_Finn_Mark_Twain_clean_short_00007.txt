Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring . 
I set still and listened . 
Directly I could just barely hear a `` me-yow ! 
me-yow ! '' 
down there . 
That was good ! 
Says I , `` me-yow ! 
me-yow ! '' 
as soft as I could , and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed . 
Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me .
