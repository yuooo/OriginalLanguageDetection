Because Joppa , the modern Jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean , the Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar . 
See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God ? 
Miserable man ! 
Oh ! 
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his God ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas . 
So disordered , self-condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . 
How plainly he 's a fugitive ! 
no baggage , not a hat-box , valise , or carpet-bag , -- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . 
At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger 's evil eye . 
Jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile .
