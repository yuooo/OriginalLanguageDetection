But there war n't no answer , and nobody come out of the wigwam . 
Jim was gone ! 
I set up a shout -- and then another -- and then another one ; and run this way and that in the woods , whooping and screeching ; but it war n't no use -- old Jim was gone . 
Then I set down and cried ; I could n't help it . 
But I could n't set still long . 
Pretty soon I went out on the road , trying to think what I better do , and I run across a boy walking , and asked him if he 'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : `` Yes . '' 
`` Whereabouts ? '' 
says I. `` Down to Silas Phelps ' place , two mile below here . 
He 's a runaway nigger , and they 've got him . 
Was you looking for him ? ''
