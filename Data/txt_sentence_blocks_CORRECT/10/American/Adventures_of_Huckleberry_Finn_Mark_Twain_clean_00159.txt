Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men -- I reckon I had n't had time to before . 
I begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix . 
I says to myself , there ai n't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would I like it ? 
So says I to Jim : `` The first light we see we 'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it 's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff , and then I 'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be hung when their time comes . '' 
But that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever . 
The rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , I reckon . 
We boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft . 
After a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it . 
It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again . 
We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
