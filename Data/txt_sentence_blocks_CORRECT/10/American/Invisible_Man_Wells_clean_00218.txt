All the larvae , all the little nauplii and tornarias , all the microscopic things , the jelly-fish . 
In the sea there are more things invisible than visible ! 
I never thought of that before . 
And in the ponds too ! 
All those little pond-life things -- specks of colourless translucent jelly ! 
But in air ? 
No ! 
`` It ca n't be . 
`` But after all -- why not ? 
`` If a man was made of glass he would still be visible . ''
