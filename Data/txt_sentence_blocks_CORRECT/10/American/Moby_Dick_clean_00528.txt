Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale 's jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt 's eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head . 
Now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale 's eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern . 
In a word , the position of the whale 's eyes corresponds to that of a man 's ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears . 
You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it . 
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind . 
In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts -LRB- side fronts -RRB- : for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ? 
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale 's eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts . 
The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him . 
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window . 
But with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view .
