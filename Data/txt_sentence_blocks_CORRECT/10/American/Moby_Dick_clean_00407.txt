turning to his comrades . 
A fierce cheer was their response . 
`` The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such sentences as these : -- ` It 's not our fault ; we did n't want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy 's business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ai n't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ? 
look to those handspikes , my hearties . 
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; do n't be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we 're your men ; but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! 
I make no promises , turn to , I say ! ' '' 
` Look ye , now , ' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ` there are a few of us here -LRB- and I am one of them -RRB- who have shipped for the cruise , d'ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we do n't want a row ; it 's not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! ' 
roared the Captain .
