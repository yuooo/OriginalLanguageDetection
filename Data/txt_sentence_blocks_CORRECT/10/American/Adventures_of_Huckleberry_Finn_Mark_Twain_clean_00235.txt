The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses . 
One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming . 
We was crossing the road . 
Buck says : `` Quick ! 
Jump for the woods ! '' 
We done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves . 
Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier . 
He had his gun across his pommel . 
I had seen him before . 
It was young Harney Shepherdson .
