`` Aye , yesterday . 
Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift ? '' 
Throttling his joy , Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel 's way , was seen descending her side . 
A few keen pulls , and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod 's main-chains , and he sprang to the deck . 
Immediately he was recognized by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew . 
But no formal salutation was exchanged . 
`` Where was he ? 
-- not killed ! 
-- not killed ! '' 
cried Ahab , closely advancing .
