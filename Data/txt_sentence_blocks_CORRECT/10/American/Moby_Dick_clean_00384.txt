Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn-looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look-outs , while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below . 
`` Ship ahoy ! 
Have ye seen the White Whale ? '' 
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . 
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us . 
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale 's name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . 
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed -- `` Ahoy there ! 
This is the Pequod , bound round the world ! 
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean ! 
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to - '' At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger 's flanks .
