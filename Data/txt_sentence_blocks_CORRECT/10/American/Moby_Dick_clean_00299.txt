ALL Aye ! 
aye ! 
OLD MANX SAILOR How the three pines shake ! 
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil , and here there 's none but the crew 's cursed clay . 
Steady , helmsman ! 
steady . 
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore , and keeled hulls split at sea . 
Our captain has his birthmark ; look yonder , boys , there 's another in the sky lurid -- like , ye see , all else pitch black . 
DAGGOO What of that ? 
Who 's afraid of black 's afraid of me !
