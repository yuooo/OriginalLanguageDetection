After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens . 
That was always his word . 
I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t ` other . 
He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way . 
He did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy . 
He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time . 
At last I got so sleepy I could n't keep my eyes open all I could do , and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep , and the candle burning . 
I do n't know how long I was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up . 
There was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes . 
He said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek -- but I could n't see no snakes .
