forty years on the pitiless sea ! 
for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep ! 
Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore . 
When I think of this life I have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled-town of a Captain 's exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh , weariness ! 
heaviness ! 
Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command ! 
-- when I think of all this ; only half-suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul ! 
-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world 's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ? 
wife ? 
-- rather a widow with her husband alive ?
