`` Elijah . '' 
Elijah ! 
thought I , and we walked away , both commenting , after each other 's fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug , trying to be a bugbear . 
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance . 
Somehow , the sight of him struck me so , that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did . 
He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us , but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine . 
This circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half-hinting , half-revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things . 
I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg , and on that side of it retraced our steps . 
But Elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us . 
This relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , I pronounced him in my heart , a humbug .
