damned in the midst of Paradise ! 
Good night -- good night ! 
-LRB- waving his hand , he moves from the window . -RRB- 
'T was not so hard a task . 
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve . 
Or , if you will , like so many ant-hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match . 
Oh , hard ! 
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting ! 
What I 've dared , I 've willed ; and what I 've willed , I 'll do ! 
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac , I am madness maddened !
