It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key-note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharge of rifles . 
The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet , less than a mile ahead -- Moby Dick bodily burst into view ! 
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching . 
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more . 
In those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his mane ; in some cases , this breaching is his act of defiance . 
`` There she breaches ! 
there she breaches ! '' 
was the cry , as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven . 
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier ; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale . 
`` Aye , breach your last to the sun , Moby Dick ! ''
