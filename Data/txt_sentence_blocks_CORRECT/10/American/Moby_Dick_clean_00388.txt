Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other 's wake in the mid-Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other 's rig . 
As for Men-of-War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all . 
As touching Slave-ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . 
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other 's cross-bones , the first hail is -- `` How many skulls ? '' 
-- the same way that whalers hail -- `` How many barrels ? '' 
And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and do n't like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likenesses . 
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! 
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? 
She has a `` Gam , '' a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about `` spouters '' and `` blubber-boilers , '' and such like pretty exclamations . 
Why it is that all Merchant-seamen , and also all Pirates and Man-of-War 's men , and Slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer .
