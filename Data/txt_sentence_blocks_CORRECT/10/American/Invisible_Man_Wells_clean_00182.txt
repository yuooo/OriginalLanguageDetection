`` Here he is ! '' 
said the barman . 
Mr. Marvel , released , suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men . 
The struggle blundered round the edge of the door . 
The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time , yelling out sharply , as the policeman trod on his foot . 
Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails . 
The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up , kicked under the diaphragm . 
The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel 's retreat . 
The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air . 
`` Where 's he gone ? ''
