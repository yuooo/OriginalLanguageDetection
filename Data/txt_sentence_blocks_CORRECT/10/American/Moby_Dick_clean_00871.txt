cried a foreboding voice in her wake . 
`` In vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin ! '' 
The Symphony It was a clear steel-blue day . 
The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman 's look , and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as Samson 's chest in his sleep . 
Hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow-white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword-fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea . 
But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them . 
Aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom . 
And at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the Equator -- denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away . 
Tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl 's forehead of heaven . 
Oh , immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure !
