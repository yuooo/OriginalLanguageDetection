Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage . 
No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen . 
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ? 
Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self-containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls . 
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain 's former sea-farings . 
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers . 
But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel 's face ; and this bright face shed a distant spot of radiance upon the ship 's tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory 's plank where Nelson fell . 
`` Ah , noble ship , '' the angel seemed to say , `` beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo ! 
the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand . '' 
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture .
