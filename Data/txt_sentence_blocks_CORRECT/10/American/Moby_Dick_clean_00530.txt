It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them . 
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye . 
If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ . 
The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it . 
It is lodged a little behind the eye . 
With respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right . 
While the ears of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without . 
Is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare 's ? 
But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel 's great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ? 
Not at all .
