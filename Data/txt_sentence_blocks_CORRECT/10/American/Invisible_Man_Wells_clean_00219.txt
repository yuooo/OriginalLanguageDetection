The bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again . 
Then it was merely an exclamation . 
He turned aside , walked out of the room , and went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there . 
It was a little room , because Dr. Kemp did not live by practice , and in it were the day 's newspapers . 
The morning 's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside . 
He caught it up , turned it over , and read the account of a `` Strange Story from Iping '' that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel . 
Kemp read it swiftly . 
`` Wrapped up ! '' 
said Kemp .
