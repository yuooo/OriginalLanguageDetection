Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discolored , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea . 
Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull . 
Do you not marvel , then , at Stubb 's boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ? 
When first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped . 
That done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of . 
But , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale 's head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers ' scales . 
The Pequod 's whale being decapitated and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship 's side -- about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element . 
And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it , by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head , and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves ; there , that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod 's waist like the giant Holofernes 's from the girdle of Judith . 
When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner . 
Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck .
