` So I am , but take that . ' 
The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm . 
He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt 's threat , whatever that might have been . 
The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before . 
`` Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew . 
Entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship 's run for salvation . 
Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest . 
On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt 's instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body .
