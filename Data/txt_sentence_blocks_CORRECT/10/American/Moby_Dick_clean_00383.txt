* * The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . 
Terrible old man ! 
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . 
The Albatross South-eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney -LRB- Albatross -RRB- by name . 
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home . 
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . 
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost . 
Only her lower sails were set . 
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . 
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising .
