`` Ye said true -- ye hav 'n' t seen Old Thunder yet , have ye ? '' 
`` Who 's Old Thunder ? '' 
said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner . 
`` Captain Ahab . '' 
`` What ! 
the captain of our ship , the Pequod ? '' 
`` Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name . 
Ye hav 'n' t seen him yet , have ye ? '' 
`` No , we hav 'n' t. He 's sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long . ''
