I reckon I was up in the tree two hours ; but I did n't see nothing , I did n't hear nothing -- I only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a thousand things . 
Well , I could n't stay up there forever ; so at last I got down , but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time . 
All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast . 
By the time it was night I was pretty hungry . 
So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- about a quarter of a mile . 
I went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK , PLUNKETY-PLUNK , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next I hear people 's voices . 
I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out . 
I had n't got far when I hear a man say : `` We better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out . 
Let 's look around . '' 
I did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
