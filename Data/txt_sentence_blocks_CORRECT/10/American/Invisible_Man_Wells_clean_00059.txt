`` Of all the strange occurrences -- '' There was a violent sneeze in the passage . 
They rushed out , and as they did so the kitchen door slammed . 
`` Bring the candle , '' said Mr. Bunting , and led the way . 
They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back . 
As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening , and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond . 
He is certain that nothing went out of the door . 
It opened , stood open for a moment , and then closed with a slam . 
As it did so , the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared . 
It was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen . 
The place was empty .
