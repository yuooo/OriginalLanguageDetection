who would craven crawl to land ! 
Terrors of the terrible ! 
is all this agony so vain ? 
Take heart , take heart , O Bulkington ! 
Bear thee grimly , demigod ! 
Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing -- straight up , leaps thy apotheosis ! 
The Advocate As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore , I am all anxiety to convince ye , ye landsmen , of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales . 
In the first place , it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions . 
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. -LRB- Sperm Whale Fishery -RRB- to his visiting card , such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous . 
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements .
