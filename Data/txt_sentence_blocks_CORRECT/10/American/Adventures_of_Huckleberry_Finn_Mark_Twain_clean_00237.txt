Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped . 
The two young men looked dark , but never said nothing . 
Miss Sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt .

`` Well , I bet I did . '' 
`` What did he do to you ? '' 
`` Him ? 
He never done nothing to me . '' 
`` Well , then , what did you want to kill him for ? '' 
`` Why , nothing -- only it 's on account of the feud . ''
