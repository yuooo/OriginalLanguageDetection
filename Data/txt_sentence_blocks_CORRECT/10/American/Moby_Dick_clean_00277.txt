That wild madness that 's only calm to comprehend itself ! 
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye ! 
I lost this leg . 
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer . 
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one . 
That 's more than ye , ye great gods , ever were . 
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket-players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes ! 
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; do n't pommel me ! 
No , ye 've knocked me down , and I am up again ; but ye have run and hidden . 
Come forth from behind your cotton bags !
