`` It 's a white whale , I say , '' resumed Ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : `` a white whale . 
Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out . '' 
All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection . 
`` Captain Ahab , '' said Tashtego , `` that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick . '' 
`` Moby Dick ? '' 
shouted Ahab . 
`` Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ? '' 
`` Does he fan-tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ? '' 
said the Gay-Header deliberately . 
`` And has he a curious spout , too , '' said Daggoo , `` very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ? ''
