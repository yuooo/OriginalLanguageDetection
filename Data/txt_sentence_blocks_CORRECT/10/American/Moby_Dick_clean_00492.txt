Slowly it floats more and more away , the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks , and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls , whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale.The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship , and every rod that it so floats , what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls , augment the murderous din . 
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen . 
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , wafted by the joyous breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite perspectives . 
There 's a most doleful and most mocking funeral ! 
The sea-vultures all in pious mourning , the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled . 
In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce . 
Oh , horrible vulturism of earth ! 
from which not the mightiest whale is free . 
Nor is this the end . 
Desecrated as the body is , a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare .
