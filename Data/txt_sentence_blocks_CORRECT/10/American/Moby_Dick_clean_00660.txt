Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office . 
That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator 's desk . 
Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer ! 
* * Bible leaves ! 
Bible leaves ! 
This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer . 
It enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality . 
The Try-Works Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try-works . 
She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship . 
It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks .
