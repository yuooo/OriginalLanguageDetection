If a door banged , Aunt Sally she jumped and said `` ouch ! '' 
if anything fell , she jumped and said `` ouch ! '' 
if you happened to touch her , when she war n't noticing , she done the same ; she could n't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every time -- so she was always a-whirling around sudden , and saying `` ouch , '' and before she 'd got two-thirds around she 'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she das n't set up . 
So the thing was working very well , Tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory . 
He said it showed it was done right . 
So he said , now for the grand bulge ! 
So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready , and was wondering what we better do with it , because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night . 
Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around ; and the nigger at the back door was asleep , and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back . 
This letter said : Do n't betray me , I wish to be your friend . 
There is a desprate gang of cut-throats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night , and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them .
