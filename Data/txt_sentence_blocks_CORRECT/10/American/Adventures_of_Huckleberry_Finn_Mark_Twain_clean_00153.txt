`` You bet it is . 
But how you goin ' to manage it this time ? '' 
`` Well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck . 
Then we 'll wait . 
Now I say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more 'n two hours befo ' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river . 
See ? 
He 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self . 
I reckon that 's a considerble sight better 'n killin ' of him . 
I 'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ai n't good sense , it ai n't good morals . 
Ai n't I right ? ''
