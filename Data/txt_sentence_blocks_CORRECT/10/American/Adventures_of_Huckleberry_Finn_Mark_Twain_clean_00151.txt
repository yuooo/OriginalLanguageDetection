Then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked . 
I could n't see them , but I could tell where they was by the whisky they 'd been having . 
I was glad I did n't drink whisky ; but it would n't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they could n't a treed me because I did n't breathe . 
I was too scared . 
And , besides , a body COULD N'T breathe and hear such talk . 
They talked low and earnest . 
Bill wanted to kill Turner . 
He says : `` He 's said he 'll tell , and he will . 
If we was to give both our shares to him NOW it would n't make no difference after the row and the way we 've served him . 
Shore 's you 're born , he 'll turn State 's evidence ; now you hear ME .
