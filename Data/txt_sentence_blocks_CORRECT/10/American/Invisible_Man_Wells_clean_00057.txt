One thing kept Mr. Bunting 's courage ; the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village . 
They heard the chink of money , and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of gold -- two pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether . 
At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action . 
Gripping the poker firmly , he rushed into the room , closely followed by Mrs. Bunting . 
`` Surrender ! '' 
cried Mr. Bunting , fiercely , and then stooped amazed . 
Apparently the room was perfectly empty . 
Yet their conviction that they had , that very moment , heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty . 
For half a minute , perhaps , they stood gaping , then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen , while Mr. Bunting , by a kindred impulse , peered under the desk . 
Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the window-curtains , and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker .
