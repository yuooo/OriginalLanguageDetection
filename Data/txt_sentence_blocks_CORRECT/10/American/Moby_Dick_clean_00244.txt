And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted Dough-Boy 's memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him . 
He was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread-faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse . 
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , Dough-Boy 's whole life was one continual lip-quiver . 
Commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over . 
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the Indian 's ; crosswise to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship . 
But for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty . 
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person . 
But , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds . 
Not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished . 
But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms .
