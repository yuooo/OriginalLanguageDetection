He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time . 
I did n't want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I 'd go now to spite pap . 
That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then I 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding . 
Every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town ; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed . 
He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line . 
He got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him . 
Well , WAS N'T he mad ? 
He said he would show who was Huck Finn 's boss . 
So he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there war n't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was . 
He kept me with him all the time , and I never got a chance to run off .
