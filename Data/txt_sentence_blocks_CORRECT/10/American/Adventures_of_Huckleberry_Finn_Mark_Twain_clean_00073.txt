I set up and looked around , a little scared . 
Then I remembered . 
The river looked miles and miles across . 
The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore . 
Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and SMELT late . 
You know what I mean -- I do n't know the words to put it in . 
I took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water . 
I listened . 
Pretty soon I made it out . 
It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it 's a still night .
