By the time this cautious search is over , a stout ironbound bucket , precisely like a well-bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands . 
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole . 
Inserting this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy-maid 's pail of new milk . 
Carefully lowered from its height , the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub . 
Then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more . 
Towards the end , Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the Tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down . 
Now , the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened . 
Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my God ! 
poor Tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight ! 
`` Man overboard ! ''
