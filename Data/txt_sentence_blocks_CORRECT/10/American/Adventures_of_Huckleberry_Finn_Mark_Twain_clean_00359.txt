`` That 's always your way , Maim -- always sailing in to help somebody before they 're hurt . 
I hai n't done nothing to him . 
He 's told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I would n't swallow it all ; and that 's every bit and grain I DID say . 
I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , ca n't he ? '' 
`` I do n't care whether 't was little or whether 't was big ; he 's here in our house and a stranger , and it was n't good of you to say it . 
If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you ought n't to say a thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed . '' 
`` Why , Maim , he said -- '' `` It do n't make no difference what he SAID -- that ai n't the thing . 
The thing is for you to treat him KIND , and not be saying things to make him remember he ai n't in his own country and amongst his own folks . '' 
I says to myself , THIS is a girl that I 'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money ! 
Then Susan SHE waltzed in ; and if you 'll believe me , she did give Hare - lip hark from the tomb !
