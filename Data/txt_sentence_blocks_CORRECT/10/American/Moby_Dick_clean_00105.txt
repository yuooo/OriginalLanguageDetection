and a pair of prodigious black pots too ! 
Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet ? 
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown , standing in the porch of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an injured eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt . 
`` Get along with ye , '' said she to the man , `` or I 'll be combing ye ! '' 
`` Come on , Queequeg , '' said I , `` all right . 
There 's Mrs. Hussey . '' 
And so it turned out ; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs . 
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs. Hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said -- `` Clam or Cod ? '' 
`` What 's that about Cods , ma'am ? '' 
said I , with much politeness .
