Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ? 
How obvious it is it , too , that this necessity for the whale 's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase . 
For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight . 
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee ! 
In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will . 
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time . 
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling . 
But owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapor -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head . 
Sure it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories . 
But what does he want of them ?
