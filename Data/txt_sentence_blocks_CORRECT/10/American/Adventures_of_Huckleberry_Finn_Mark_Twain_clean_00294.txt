Families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons . 
There was considerable whisky drinking going on , and I seen three fights . 
By and by somebody sings out : `` Here comes old Boggs ! 
-- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys ! '' 
All the loafers looked glad ; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs . 
One of them says : `` Wonder who he 's a-gwyne to chaw up this time . 
If he 'd a-chawed up all the men he 's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he 'd have considerable ruputation now . '' 
Another one says , `` I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me , ` cuz then I 'd know I war n't gwyne to die for a thousan ' year . '' 
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out : `` Cler the track , thar . 
I 'm on the waw-path , and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise . ''
