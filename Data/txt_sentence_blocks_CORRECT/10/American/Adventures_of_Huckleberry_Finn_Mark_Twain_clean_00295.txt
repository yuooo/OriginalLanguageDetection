He was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face . 
Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him , and he sassed back , and said he 'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he could n't wait now because he 'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn , and his motto was , `` Meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on . '' 
He see me , and rode up and says : `` Whar 'd you come f 'm , boy ? 
You prepared to die ? '' 
Then he rode on . 
I was scared , but a man says : `` He do n't mean nothing ; he 's always a-carryin ' on like that when he 's drunk . 
He 's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober . '' 
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : `` Come out here , Sherburn ! 
Come out and meet the man you 've swindled . 
You 're the houn ' I 'm after , and I 'm a-gwyne to have you , too ! ''
