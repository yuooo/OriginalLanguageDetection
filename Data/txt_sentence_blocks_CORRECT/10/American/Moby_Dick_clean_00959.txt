PREFACE TO GONDIBERT . 
`` What spermacetti is , men might justly doubt , since the learned Hosmannus in his work of thirty years , saith plainly , Nescio quid sit . '' 
-- SIR T. BROWNE . 
OF SPERMA CETI AND THE SPERMA CETI WHALE . 
VIDE HIS V. E. `` Like Spencer 's Talus with his modern flail He threatens ruin with his ponderous tail . 
... Their fixed jav ` lins in his side he wears , And on his back a grove of pikes appears . '' 
-- WALLER 'S BATTLE OF THE SUMMER ISLANDS . 
`` By art is created that great Leviathan , called a Commonwealth or State -- -LRB- in Latin , Civitas -RRB- which is but an artificial man . '' 
-- OPENING SENTENCE OF HOBBES 'S LEVIATHAN . 
`` Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing , as if it had been a sprat in the mouth of a whale . ''
