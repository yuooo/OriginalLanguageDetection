We sing ; they sleep -- aye , lie down there , like ground-tier butts . 
At 'em again ! 
There , take this copper-pump , and hail 'em through it . 
Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lassies . 
Tell 'em it 's the resurrection ; they must kiss their last , and come to judgment . 
That 's the way -- that 's it ; thy throat ai n't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter . 
FRENCH SAILOR Hist , boys ! 
let 's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay . 
What say ye ? 
There comes the other watch .
