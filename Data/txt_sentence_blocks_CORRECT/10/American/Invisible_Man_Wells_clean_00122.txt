asked Mr. Bunting . 
`` No illustrations throwing light -- '' `` See for yourself , '' said Mr. Cuss . 
`` Some of it 's mathematical and some of it 's Russian or some such language -LRB- to judge by the letters -RRB- , and some of it 's Greek . 
Now the Greek I thought _ you _ -- '' `` Of course , '' said Mr. Bunting , taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable -- for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about ; `` yes -- the Greek , of course , may furnish a clue . '' 
`` I 'll find you a place . '' 
`` I 'd rather glance through the volumes first , '' said Mr. Bunting , still wiping . 
`` A general impression first , Cuss , and then , you know , we can go looking for clues . '' 
He coughed , put on his glasses , arranged them fastidiously , coughed again , and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure . 
Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner . 
And then something did happen .
