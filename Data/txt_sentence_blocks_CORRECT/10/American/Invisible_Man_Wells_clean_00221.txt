`` Good Heavens ! '' 
said Kemp , reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in Iping , of the previous afternoon , that have already been described . 
Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted . 
He re-read it . 
`` Ran through the streets striking right and left . 
Jaffers insensible . 
Mr. Huxter in great pain -- still unable to describe what he saw . 
Painful humiliation -- vicar . 
Woman ill with terror ! 
Windows smashed .
