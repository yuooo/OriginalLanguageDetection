In compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty-four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck , -- Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly and gloomily , -- than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance . 
Ere knocking at his state-room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment . 
The cabin lamp -- taking long swings this way and that -- was burning fitfully , and casting fitful shadows upon the old man 's bolted door , -- a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper panels . 
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements . 
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed , as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead . 
Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck 's heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself . 
`` He would have shot me once , '' he murmured , `` yes , there 's the very musket that he pointed at me ; -- that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it -- lift it . 
Strange , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now . 
Loaded ? 
I must see .
