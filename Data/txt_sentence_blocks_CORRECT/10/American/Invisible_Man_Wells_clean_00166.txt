`` You 'd better move on , '' said the mariner . 
`` Who 's moving on ? '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait , with occasional violent jerks forward . 
Some way along the road he began a muttered monologue , protests and recriminations . 
`` Silly devil ! '' 
said the mariner , legs wide apart , elbows akimbo , watching the receding figure . 
`` I 'll show you , you silly ass -- hoaxing me ! 
It 's here -- on the paper ! '' 
Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and , receding , was hidden by a bend in the road , but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way , until the approach of a butcher 's cart dislodged him .
