The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck . 
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height . 
The foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers . 
On the flanks it is cased with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , sloping , battened hatchway . 
Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots , two in number , and each of several barrels ' capacity . 
When not in use , they are kept remarkably clean . 
Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punchbowls . 
During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap . 
While employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips . 
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation .
