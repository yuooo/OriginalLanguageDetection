And that gave him another idea , and he says : `` Borrow a shirt , too . '' 
`` What do we want of a shirt , Tom ? '' 
`` Want it for Jim to keep a journal on . '' 
`` Journal your granny -- JIM ca n't write . '' 
`` S'pose he CA N'T write -- he can make marks on the shirt , ca n't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop ? '' 
`` Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too . '' 
`` PRISONERS do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins . 
They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall . 
THEY would n't use a goose-quill if they had it . 
It ai n't regular . ''
