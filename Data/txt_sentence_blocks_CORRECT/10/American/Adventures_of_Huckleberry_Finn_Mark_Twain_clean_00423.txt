-- I take it all back ! '' 
The duke says : `` Well , you just own up , first , that you DID hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself . '' 
`` Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b ` lieve you , and take back everything I said . '' 
`` You old scoundrel , I did n't , and you know I did n't . 
There , now ! '' 
`` Well , then , I b ` lieve you . 
But answer me only jest this one more -- now DO N'T git mad ; did n't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it ? '' 
The duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : `` Well , I do n't care if I DID , I did n't DO it , anyway . 
But you not only had it in mind to do it , but you DONE it . '' 
`` I wisht I never die if I done it , duke , and that 's honest .
