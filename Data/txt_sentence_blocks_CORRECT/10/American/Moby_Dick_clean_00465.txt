overboard you go , and cut me one from his small ! '' 
Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war -LRB- at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage -RRB- , yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body . 
About midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head , as if that capstan were a sideboard . 
Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale 's flesh that night . 
Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness . 
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ' hearts . 
Peering over the side you could just see them -LRB- as before you heard them -RRB- wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head . 
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous . 
How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things . 
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw .
