I shot this fellow and took him into camp . 
I took the axe and smashed in the door . 
I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it . 
I fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; I say ground because it was ground -- hard packed , and no boards . 
Well , next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all I could drag -- and I started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight . 
You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground . 
I did wish Tom Sawyer was there ; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches . 
Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that . 
Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner . 
Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket -LRB- so he could n't drip -RRB- till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
