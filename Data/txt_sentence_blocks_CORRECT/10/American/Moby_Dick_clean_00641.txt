said the Guernsey-man , when the Captain had returned to them . 
`` Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact , tell him I 've diddled him , and -LRB- aside to himself -RRB- perhaps somebody else . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , that he 's very happy to have been of any service to us . '' 
Hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties -LRB- meaning himself and mate -RRB- , and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux . 
`` He wants you to take a glass of wine with him , '' said the interpreter . 
`` Thank him heartily ; but tell him it 's against my principles to drink with the man I 've diddled . 
In fact , tell him I must go . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , that his principles wo n't admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it 's so calm they wo n't drift . '' 
By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect , -- that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship 's side . 
While the Frenchman 's boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line .
