cried Steelkilt . 
`` Oh ! 
certainly , '' said the Captain , and the key clicked . 
`` It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives -LRB- long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end -RRB- run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship . 
For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not . 
That was the last night he should spend in that den . 
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender . 
And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come . 
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time . 
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out .
