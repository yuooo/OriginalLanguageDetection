Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : '' 'T is my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression . 
Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; I yield , I submit ; 't is my fate . 
I am alone in the world -- let me suffer ; can bear it . '' 
We got away as soon as it was good and dark . 
The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town . 
We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by -- that was the town , you know -- and slid by , about a half a mile out , all right . 
When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night . 
It was my watch below till twelve , but I would n't a turned in anyway if I 'd had a bed , because a body do n't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight . 
My souls , how the wind did scream along ! 
And every second or two there 'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around , and you 'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a H-WHACK !
