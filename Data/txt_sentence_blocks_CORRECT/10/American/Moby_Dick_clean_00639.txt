This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the Captain 's round-house -LRB- cabinet he called it -RRB- to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times . 
Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle . 
Sounding him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris . 
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity . 
According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey-man , under cover of an interpreter 's office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview . 
By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin . 
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side . 
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them . 
`` What shall I say to him first ? '' 
said he .
