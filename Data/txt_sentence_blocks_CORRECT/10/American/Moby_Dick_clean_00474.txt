`` Avast ! 
heave to ! 
I mean when you die , cook . 
It 's an awful question . 
Now what 's your answer ? '' 
`` When dis old brack man dies , '' said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , `` he hisself wo n't go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him . '' 
`` Fetch him ? 
How ? 
In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ? 
And fetch him where ? ''
