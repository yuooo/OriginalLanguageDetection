A goney , he replied . 
Goney ! 
never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore ! 
never ! 
But some time after , I learned that goney was some seaman 's name for albatross . 
So that by no possibility could Coleridge 's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck . 
For neither had I then read the Rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross . 
Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet . 
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl . 
But how had the mystic thing been caught ?
