cried Ahab , `` thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand ! 
-- Down ! 
down all of ye , but one man at the fore . 
The boats ! 
-- stand by ! '' 
Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated backstays and halyards ; while Ahab , less dartingly , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch . 
`` Lower away , '' he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous . 
`` Mr. Starbuck , the ship is thine -- keep away from the boats , but keep near them . 
Lower , all ! '' 
As if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first assailant himself , Moby Dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews .
