She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever . 
So I did n't think much of it . 
But I never said so . 
I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight . 
I was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together . 
Miss Watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome . 
By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed . 
I went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table . 
Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use . 
I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead .
