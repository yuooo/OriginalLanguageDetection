Says I to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament . 
So I give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with `` HALF-PAST TWO '' wrote on it with a pencil . 
I ransacked it , but could n't find anything else . 
I could n't make anything out of that , so I put the paper in the book again , and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me . 
She pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said I was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody . 
She was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty . 
I was a good deal astonished , but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if I had read it , and I said no , and she asked me if I could read writing , and I told her `` no , only coarse-hand , '' and then she said the paper war n't anything but a book-mark to keep her place , and I might go and play now . 
I went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind . 
When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes a - running , and says : `` Mars Jawge , if you 'll come down into de swamp I 'll show you a whole stack o ' water-moccasins . '' 
Thinks I , that 's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday .
