But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own . 
That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale has done it . 
First : In the year 1820 the ship Essex , Captain Pollard , of Nantucket , was cruising in the Pacific Ocean . 
One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales . 
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship . 
Dashing his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than `` ten minutes '' she settled down and fell over . 
Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since . 
After the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats . 
Being returned home at last , Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never attempted it since . 
At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket .
