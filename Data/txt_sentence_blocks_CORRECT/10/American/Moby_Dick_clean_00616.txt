Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness . 
Further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waited . 
The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near . 
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery , -- the more whales the less fish . 
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured . 
The rest contrived to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod . 
Schools and Schoolmasters The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations . 
Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached bands are occasionally observed , embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each . 
Such bands are known as schools . 
They generally are of two sorts ; those composed almost entirely of females , and those mustering none but young vigorous males , or bulls as they are familiarly designated .
