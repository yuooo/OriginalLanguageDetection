In the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips , that came trailing after her , at the end of interminable necks , and with vast black eyes . 
But being a sensible woman , she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again . 
THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February , at the beginning of the thaw , this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village . 
Next day his luggage arrived through the slush -- and very remarkable luggage it was . 
There were a couple of trunks indeed , such as a rational man might need , but in addition there were a box of books -- big , fat books , of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting -- and a dozen or more crates , boxes , and cases , containing objects packed in straw , as it seemed to Hall , tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw -- glass bottles . 
The stranger , muffled in hat , coat , gloves , and wrapper , came out impatiently to meet Fearenside 's cart , while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in . 
Out he came , not noticing Fearenside 's dog , who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at Hall 's legs . 
`` Come along with those boxes , '' he said . 
`` I 've been waiting long enough . '' 
And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate .
