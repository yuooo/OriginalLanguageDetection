The lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low ; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : `` That 'll fix it . 
I 'll take the order and send it , along with your brother 's , and then they 'll know it 's all right . '' 
So they got some paper and a pen , and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side , and chawed his tongue , and scrawled off something ; and then they give the pen to the duke -- and then for the first time the duke looked sick . 
But he took the pen and wrote . 
So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says : `` You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names . '' 
The old gentleman wrote , but nobody could n't read it . 
The lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : `` Well , it beats ME '' -- and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket , and examined them , and then examined the old man 's writing , and then THEM again ; and then says : `` These old letters is from Harvey Wilks ; and here 's THESE two handwritings , and anybody can see they did n't write them '' -LRB- the king and the duke looked sold and foolish , I tell you , to see how the lawyer had took them in -RRB- , `` and here 's THIS old gentleman 's hand writing , and anybody can tell , easy enough , HE did n't write them -- fact is , the scratches he makes ai n't properly WRITING at all . 
Now , here 's some letters from -- '' The new old gentleman says : `` If you please , let me explain . 
Nobody can read my hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me . 
It 's HIS hand you 've got there , not mine . ''
