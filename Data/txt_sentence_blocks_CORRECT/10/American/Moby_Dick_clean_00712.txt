The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver 's loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures . 
All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message-carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active . 
Through the lacings of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure . 
Oh , busy weaver ! 
unseen weaver ! 
-- pause ! 
-- one word ! 
-- whither flows the fabric ? 
what palace may it deck ? 
wherefore all these ceaseless toilings ?
