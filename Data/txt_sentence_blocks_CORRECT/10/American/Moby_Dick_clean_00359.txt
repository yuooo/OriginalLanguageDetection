`` Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . 
-LRB- Strong , strong , boys ! -RRB- '' 
in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : `` A sad business , Mr. Stubb ! 
-LRB- seethe her , seethe her , my lads ! -RRB- 
but never mind , Mr. Stubb , all for the best . 
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will . 
-LRB- Spring , my men , spring ! -RRB- 
There 's hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr. Stubb , and that 's what ye came for . 
-LRB- Pull , my boys ! -RRB- 
Sperm , sperm 's the play !
