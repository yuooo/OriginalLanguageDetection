But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross . 
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin ! 
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears . 
The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion .

Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible . 
From its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall . 
Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . 
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place ! 
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue .
