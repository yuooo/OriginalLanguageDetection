As for Bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper . 
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam . 
During these days of preparation , Queequeg and I often visited the craft , and as often I asked about Captain Ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship . 
To these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two Captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage . 
If I had been downright honest with myself , I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea . 
But when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself . 
And much this way it was with me . 
I said nothing , and tried to think nothing . 
At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail . 
So next morning , Queequeg and I took a very early start .
