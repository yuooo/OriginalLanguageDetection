I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death . 
But mark the other head 's expression . 
See that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel 's side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw . 
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ? 
This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic ; the Sperm Whale , a Platonian , who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years . 
The Battering-Ram Ere quitting , for the nonce , the Sperm Whale 's head , I would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply -- particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness . 
I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there . 
Here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history . 
You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin . 
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head ; nearly one third of his entire length from the front .
