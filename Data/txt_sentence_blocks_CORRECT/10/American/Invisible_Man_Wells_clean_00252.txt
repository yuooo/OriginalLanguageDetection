`` I was surprised to find , now that my prize was within my grasp , how inconclusive its attainment seemed . 
As a matter of fact I was worked out ; the intense stress of nearly four years ' continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling . 
I was apathetic , and I tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries , the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my father 's grey hairs . 
Nothing seemed to matter . 
I saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood , due to overwork and want of sleep , and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies . 
`` All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through ; the fixed idea still ruled me . 
And soon , for the money I had was almost exhausted . 
I looked about me at the hillside , with children playing and girls watching them , and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world . 
After a time I crawled home , took some food and a strong dose of strychnine , and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed . 
Strychnine is a grand tonic , Kemp , to take the flabbiness out of a man . ''
