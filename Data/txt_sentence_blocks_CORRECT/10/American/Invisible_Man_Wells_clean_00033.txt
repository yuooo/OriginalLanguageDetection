`` A very good idea , '' said the stranger . 
`` This stror , sir , if I might make so bold as to remark -- '' `` Do n't . 
If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill . '' 
And he mumbled at her -- words suspiciously like curses . 
He was so odd , standing there , so aggressive and explosive , bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other , that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed . 
But she was a resolute woman . 
`` In which case , I should like to know , sir , what you consider -- '' `` A shilling -- put down a shilling . 
Surely a shilling 's enough ? '' 
`` So be it , '' said Mrs. Hall , taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table . 
`` If you 're satisfied , of course -- '' He turned and sat down , with his coat-collar toward her .
