`` I never thought , I was so stirred up , '' she says ; `` now go on , and I wo n't do so any more . 
You tell me what to do , and whatever you say I 'll do it . '' 
`` Well , '' I says , `` it 's a rough gang , them two frauds , and I 'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer , whether I want to or not -- I druther not tell you why ; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws , and I 'd be all right ; but there 'd be another person that you do n't know about who 'd be in big trouble . 
Well , we got to save HIM , hai n't we ? 
Of course . 
Well , then , we wo n't blow on them . '' 
Saying them words put a good idea in my head . 
I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds ; get them jailed here , and then leave . 
But I did n't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ; so I did n't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night .
