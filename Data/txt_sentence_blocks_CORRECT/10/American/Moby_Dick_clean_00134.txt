So good-bye to thee -- and wrong not Captain Ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name . 
Besides , my boy , he has a wife -- not three voyages wedded -- a sweet , resigned girl . 
Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man had a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ? 
No , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , Ahab has his humanities ! '' 
As I walked away , I was full of thoughtfulness ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab , filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him . 
And somehow , at the time , I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for I do n't know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg . 
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which I can not at all describe , was not exactly awe ; I do not know what it was . 
But I felt it ; and it did not disincline me towards him ; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so imperfectly as he was known to me then . 
However , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind . 
The Ramadan As Queequeg 's Ramadan , or Fasting and Humiliation , was to continue all day , I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody 's religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name .
