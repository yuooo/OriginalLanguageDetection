`` I war n't up at the Pint in the mornin ' . ''

Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher . 
`` Preacher be hanged , he 's a fraud and a liar . 
He was up at the Pint that mornin ' . 
I live up there , do n't I ? 
Well , I was up there , and he was up there . 
I see him there . 
He come in a canoe , along with Tim Collins and a boy . ''
