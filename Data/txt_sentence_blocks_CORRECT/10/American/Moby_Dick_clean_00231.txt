In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis . 
On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split . 
But it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy -- there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification . 
Nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the Greenland whale 's anatomy more striking than his baleen ? 
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale . 
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated . 
What then remains ? 
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way . 
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable . 
To proceed .
