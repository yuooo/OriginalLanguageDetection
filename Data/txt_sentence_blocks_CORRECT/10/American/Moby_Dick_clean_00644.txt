Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale ! 
Yet so it is . 
By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale . 
How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth 's pills , and then running out of harm 's way , as laborers do in blasting rocks . 
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ' trousers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing , more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner . 
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ? 
Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonor , but raised in glory . 
And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk . 
Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor , Cologne-water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst . 
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but can not , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman 's two whales .
