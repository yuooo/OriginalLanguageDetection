Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was a-going all the time . 
She says : `` Well , Sister Phelps , I 've ransacked that-air cabin over , an ' I b ` lieve the nigger was crazy . 
I says to Sister Damrell -- did n't I , Sister Damrell ? 
-- s ` I , he 's crazy , s ` I -- them 's the very words I said . 
You all hearn me : he 's crazy , s ` I ; everything shows it , s ` I. Look at that-air grindstone , s ` I ; want to tell ME ' t any cretur ` t 's in his right mind 's a goin ' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone , s ` I ? 
Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart ; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year , 'n' all that -- natcherl son o ' Louis somebody , 'n' sich everlast 'n rubbage . 
He 's plumb crazy , s ` I ; it 's what I says in the fust place , it 's what I says in the middle , 'n' it 's what I says last 'n' all the time -- the nigger 's crazy -- crazy 's Nebokoodneezer , s ` I. '' `` An ' look at that-air ladder made out 'n rags , Sister Hotchkiss , '' says old Mrs. Damrell ; `` what in the name o ' goodness COULD he ever want of -- '' `` The very words I was a-sayin ' no longer ago th 'n this minute to Sister Utterback , 'n' she 'll tell you so herself . 
Sh-she , look at that-air rag ladder , sh-she ; 'n' s ` I , yes , LOOK at it , s ` I -- what COULD he a-wanted of it , s ` I. Sh-she , Sister Hotchkiss , sh-she -- '' `` But how in the nation 'd they ever GIT that grindstone IN there , ANYWAY ? 
'n' who dug that-air HOLE ? 
'n' who -- '' `` My very WORDS , Brer Penrod !
