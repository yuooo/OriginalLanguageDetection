But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . 
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose . 
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . 
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale 's flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . 
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ? 
Must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great ? 
The Castaway It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod 's crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own . 
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats . 
Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale . 
As a general thing , these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ' crews .
