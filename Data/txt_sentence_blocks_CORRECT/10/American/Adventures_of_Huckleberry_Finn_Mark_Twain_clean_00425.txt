Cuss you , I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted to get what money I 'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it ALL ! '' 
The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : `` Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it war n't me . '' 
`` Dry up ! 
I do n't want to hear no more out of you ! '' 
says the duke . 
`` And NOW you see what you GOT by it . 
They 've got all their own money back , and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES . 
G'long to bed , and do n't you deffersit ME no more deffersits , long 's YOU live ! '' 
So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off a-snoring in each other 's arms . 
They both got powerful mellow , but I noticed the king did n't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again .
