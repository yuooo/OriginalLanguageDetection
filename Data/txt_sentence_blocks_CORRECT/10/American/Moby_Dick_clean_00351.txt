The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs . 
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale . 
So look the long line of man-of-war 's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy 's ship . 
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale . 
With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air . 
The First Lowering The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there . 
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain 's , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter . 
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips . 
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff . 
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head .
