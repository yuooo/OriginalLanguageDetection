The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away . 
As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him . 
He did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first . 
He was awful surprised . 
He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or other -- would n't be gone long . 
I wished I was out of that tree , but I das n't come down . 
Buck begun to cry and rip , and ` lowed that him and his cousin Joe -LRB- that was the other young chap -RRB- would make up for this day yet . 
He said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy . 
Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush . 
Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations -- the Shepherdsons was too strong for them .
