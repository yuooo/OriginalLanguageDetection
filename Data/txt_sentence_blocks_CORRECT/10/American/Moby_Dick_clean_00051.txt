This young fellow 's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he can not have been three days landed from his Indian voyage . 
That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . 
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . 
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ? 
which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone . 
`` Grub , ho ! '' 
now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast . 
They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self-possessed in company . 
Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor . 
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor Mungo 's performances -- this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish .
