We lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights . 
He had a gun which he had stole , I reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on . 
Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me . 
The widow she found out where I was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till I was used to being where I was , and liked it -- all but the cowhide part . 
It was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study . 
Two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and I did n't see how I 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time . 
I did n't want to go back no more . 
I had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now I took to it again because pap had n't no objections . 
It was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around . 
But by and by pap got too handy with his hick ` ry , and I could n't stand it .
