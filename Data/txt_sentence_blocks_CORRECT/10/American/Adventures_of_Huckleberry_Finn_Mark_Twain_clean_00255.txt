He says : `` Laws bless you , chile , I ` uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin . 
Jack 's been heah ; he say he reck 'n you 's ben shot , kase you didn ' come home no mo ' ; so I 's jes ' dis minute a startin ' de raf ' down towards de mouf er de crick , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you IS dead . 
Lawsy , I 's mighty glad to git you back again , honey . '' 
I says : `` All right -- that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think I 've been killed , and floated down the river -- there 's something up there that 'll help them think so -- so do n't you lose no time , Jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can . '' 
I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi . 
Then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more . 
I had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greens -- there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time . 
I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was Jim to get away from the swamp . 
We said there war n't no home like a raft , after all . 
Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft do n't .
