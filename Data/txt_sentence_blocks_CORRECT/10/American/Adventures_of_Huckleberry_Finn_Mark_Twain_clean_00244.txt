He oughter know a body do n't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them . 
What is he up to , anyway ? 
So I says : `` All right ; trot ahead . '' 
I followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile . 
We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : `` You shove right in dah jist a few steps , Mars Jawge ; dah 's whah dey is . 
I 's seed 'm befo ' ; I do n't k ` yer to see 'em no mo ' . '' 
Then he slopped right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him . 
I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines , and found a man laying there asleep -- and , by jings , it was my old Jim ! 
I waked him up , and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it war n't . 
He nearly cried he was so glad , but he war n't surprised .
