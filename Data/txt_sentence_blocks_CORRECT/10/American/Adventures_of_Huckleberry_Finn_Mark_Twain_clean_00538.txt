So Jim he was sorry , and said he would n't behave so no more , and then me and Tom shoved for bed . 
IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down , and unstopped the best rat-hole , and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally 's bed . 
But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there , and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out , and they did ; and Aunt Sally she come in , and when we got back she was a - standing on top of the bed raising Cain , and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her . 
So she took and dusted us both with the hickry , and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen , drat that meddlesome cub , and they war n't the likeliest , nuther , because the first haul was the pick of the flock . 
I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was . 
We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet 's nest , but we did n't . 
The family was at home . 
We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we 'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it . 
Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient . 
And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ?
