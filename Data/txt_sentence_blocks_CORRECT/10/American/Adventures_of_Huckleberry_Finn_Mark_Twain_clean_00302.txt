Sherburn never said a word -- just stood there , looking down . 
The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable . 
Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out - gaze him , but they could n't ; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky . 
Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that 's got sand in it . 
Then he says , slow and scornful : `` The idea of YOU lynching anybody ! 
It 's amusing . 
The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN ! 
Because you 're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a MAN ? 
Why , a MAN 'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it 's daytime and you 're not behind him . 
`` Do I know you ?
