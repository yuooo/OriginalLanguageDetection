Speak , weaver ! 
-- stay thy hand ! 
-- but one single word with thee ! 
Nay -- the shuttle flies -- the figures float from forth the loom ; the fresher-rushing carpet for ever slides away . 
The weaver-god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it . 
For even so it is in all material factories . 
The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements . 
Thereby have villainies been detected . 
Ah , mortal ! 
then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world 's loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar .
