The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him . 
Halfway up the staircase was Colonel Adye , the recipient of Kemp 's letter , the chief of the Burdock police . 
He was staring aghast at the sudden appearance of Kemp , followed by the extraordinary sight of clothing tossing empty in the air . 
He saw Kemp felled , and struggling to his feet . 
He saw him rush forward , and go down again , felled like an ox . 
Then suddenly he was struck violently . 
By nothing ! 
A vast weight , it seemed , leapt upon him , and he was hurled headlong down the staircase , with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin . 
An invisible foot trod on his back , a ghostly patter passed downstairs , he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run , and the front door of the house slammed violently . 
He rolled over and sat up staring .
