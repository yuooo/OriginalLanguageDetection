It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres . 
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit . 
By midnight the works were in full operation . 
We were clear from the carcass ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense . 
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed Greek fire . 
The burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed . 
So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations . 
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them . 
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale-ship 's stokers . 
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
