Well , I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek . 
The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard , and his eye lights up like he judged he 'd got the king THIS time , and says : `` There -- you 've heard what he said ! 
Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks ' breast ? '' 
Both of them spoke up and says : `` We did n't see no such mark . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
says the old gentleman . 
`` Now , what you DID see on his breast was a small dim P , and a B -LRB- which is an initial he dropped when he was young -RRB- , and a W , with dashes between them , so : P -- B -- W '' -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper . 
`` Come , ai n't that what you saw ? '' 
Both of them spoke up again , and says : `` No , we DID N'T . 
We never seen any marks at all . ''
