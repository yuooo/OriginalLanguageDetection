Thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George . 
And therefore , let not the knights of that honorable company -LRB- none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron -RRB- , let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George 's decoration than they . 
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long remained dubious : for though according to the Greek mythologies , that antique Crockett and Kit Carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted . 
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside . 
Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale . 
I claim him for one of our clan . 
But , by the best contradictory authorities , this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice versa ; certainly they are very similar . 
If I claim the demigod then , why not the prophet ? 
Nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order . 
Our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head-waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves .
