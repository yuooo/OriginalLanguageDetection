`` Shucks ! '' 
says the king , very sarcastic ; `` but I do n't know -- maybe you was asleep , and did n't know what you was about . '' 
The duke bristles up now , and says : `` Oh , let UP on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame ' fool ? 
Do n't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin ? '' 
`` YES , sir ! 
I know you DO know , because you done it yourself ! '' 
`` It 's a lie ! '' 
-- and the duke went for him . 
The king sings out : `` Take y' r hands off ! 
-- leggo my throat !
