It was about sundown . 
The doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand . 
We all got in a big room in the hotel , and lit up some candles , and fetched in the new couple . 
First , the doctor says : `` I do n't wish to be too hard on these two men , but I think they 're frauds , and they may have complices that we do n't know nothing about . 
If they have , wo n't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left ? 
It ai n't unlikely . 
If these men ai n't frauds , they wo n't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they 're all right -- ai n't that so ? '' 
Everybody agreed to that . 
So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart . 
But the king he only looked sorrowful , and says : `` Gentlemen , I wish the money was there , for I ai n't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , out-and-out investigation o ' this misable business ; but , alas , the money ai n't there ; you k 'n send and see , if you want to . ''
