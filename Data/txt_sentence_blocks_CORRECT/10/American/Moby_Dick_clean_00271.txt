Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . 
Perchance ye need it not . 
Down lances ! 
And now , ye mates , I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . 
Disdain the task ? 
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? 
Oh , my sweet cardinals ! 
your own condescension , that shall bend ye to it . 
I do not order ye ; ye will it . 
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! ''
