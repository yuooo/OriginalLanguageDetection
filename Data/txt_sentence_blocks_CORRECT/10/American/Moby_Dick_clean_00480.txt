And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . 
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called `` fritters '' ; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough-nuts or oly-cooks , when fresh . 
They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off . 
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . 
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good . 
Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo 's -LRB- which is esteemed a rare dish -RRB- , were it not such a solid pyramid of fat . 
But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter . 
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it . 
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile . 
Many a good supper have I thus made .
