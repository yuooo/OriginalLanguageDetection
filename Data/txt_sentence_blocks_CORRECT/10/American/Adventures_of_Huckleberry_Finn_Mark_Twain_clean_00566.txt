It looks foolish enough NOW , in the daytime ; but I says to myself , there 's my two poor boys asleep , ` way up stairs in that lonesome room , and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy ' t I crep ' up there and locked 'em in ! 
I DID . 
And anybody would . 
Because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o ' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos 'n I was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ai n't locked , and you -- '' She stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on me -- I got up and took a walk . 
Says I to myself , I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little . 
So I done it . 
But I das n't go fur , or she 'd a sent for me . 
And when it was late in the day the people all went , and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and `` Sid , '' and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightning-rod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we did n't never want to try THAT no more . 
And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before ; and then she said she 'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harum - scarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm had n't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done . 
So then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : `` Why , lawsamercy , it 's most night , and Sid not come yet !
