Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door . 
Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer . 
In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable . 
He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram . 
When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : `` Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? '' 
`` No , my boy , '' says the old gentleman , `` I 'm sorry to say ' t your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more . 
Come in , come in . '' 
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , `` Too late -- he 's out of sight . '' 
`` Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's . '' 
`` Oh , I CA N'T make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it .
