Steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material -- pine . 
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting . 
But before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks . 
As a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play . 
Look now at Stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling . 
Look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead . 
Handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed . 
Then holding the lance full before his waistband 's middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air . 
He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin . 
Next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale .
