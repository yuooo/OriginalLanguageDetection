So man 's seconds tick ! 
Oh ! 
how immaterial are all materials ! 
What things real are there , but imponderable thoughts ? 
Here now 's the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere hap , made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life . 
A life-buoy of a coffin ! 
Does it go further ? 
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an immortality-preserver ! 
I 'll think of that . 
But no .
