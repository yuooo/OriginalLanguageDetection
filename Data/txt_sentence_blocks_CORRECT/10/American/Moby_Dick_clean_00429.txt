I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . 
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long . 
Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye ! 
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . 
Look at that popular work `` Goldsmith 's Animated Nature . '' 
In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged `` whale '' and a `` narwhale . '' 
I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys . 
Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan . 
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale -LRB- that is to say the Right whale -RRB- , even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature . 
But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron .
