Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature . 
He has no proper nose . 
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . 
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose . 
Dash the nose from Phidias 's marble Jove , and what a sorry remainder ! 
Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all . 
Nay , it is an added grandeur . 
A nose to the whale would have been impertinent . 
As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled . 
A pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne .
