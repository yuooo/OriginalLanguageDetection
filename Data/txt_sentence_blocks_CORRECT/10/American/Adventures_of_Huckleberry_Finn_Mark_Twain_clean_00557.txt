WELL , den , is JIM gywne to say it ? 
No , sah -- I doan ' budge a step out 'n dis place ` dout a DOCTOR , not if it 's forty year ! '' 
I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he 'd say what he did say -- so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor . 
He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and would n't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we would n't let him . 
Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it did n't do no good . 
So when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : `` Well , then , if you re bound to go , I 'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village . 
Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast , and make him swear to be silent as the grave , and put a purse full of gold in his hand , and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark , and then fetch him here in the canoe , in a roundabout way amongst the islands , and search him and take his chalk away from him , and do n't give it back to him till you get him back to the village , or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again . 
It 's the way they all do . '' 
So I said I would , and left , and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again . 
THE doctor was an old man ; a very nice , kind-looking old man when I got him up .
