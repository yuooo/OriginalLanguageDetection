I wished I had n't ever come ashore that night to see such things . 
I ai n't ever going to get shut of them -- lots of times I dream about them . 
I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down . 
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on . 
I was mighty downhearted ; so I made up my mind I would n't ever go anear that house again , because I reckoned I was to blame , somehow . 
I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off ; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess would n't ever happened . 
When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till I got them ashore ; then I covered up their faces , and got away as quick as I could . 
I cried a little when I was covering up Buck 's face , for he was mighty good to me . 
It was just dark now . 
I never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
