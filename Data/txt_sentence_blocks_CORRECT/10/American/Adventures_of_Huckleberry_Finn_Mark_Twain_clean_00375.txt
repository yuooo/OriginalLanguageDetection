`` Honor bright , now -- no lies . '' 
`` Honor bright , your majesty , I 'm telling you the truth . 
I hai n't been a - near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you . '' 
The duke says : `` Have you seen anybody else go in there ? '' 
`` No , your grace , not as I remember , I believe . '' 
`` Stop and think . '' 
I studied awhile and see my chance ; then I says : `` Well , I see the niggers go in there several times . '' 
Both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they had n't ever expected it , and then like they HAD . 
Then the duke says : `` What , all of them ? ''
