Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up . 
Consider ! 
For hereby Flask 's dinner was badly jammed in point of time . 
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . 
If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck . 
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less . 
For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him . 
Peace and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach . 
I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned beef in the fore-castle , as I used to when I was before the mast . 
There 's the fruits of promotion now ; there 's the vanity of glory : there 's the insanity of life !
