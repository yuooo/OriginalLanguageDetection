Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- Aside -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming . 
Midnight , Forecastle HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS -LRB- Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing , lounging , leaning , and lying in various attitudes , all singing in chorus . -RRB- 
Farewell and adieu to you , Spanish ladies ! 
Farewell and adieu to you , ladies of Spain ! 
Our captain 's commanded . 
-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR Oh , boys , do n't be sentimental .
