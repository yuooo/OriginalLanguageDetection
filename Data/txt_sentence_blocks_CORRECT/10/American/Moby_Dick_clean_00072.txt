Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the Captain . 
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit . 
Not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and Jonah is put down for his passage . 
` Point out my state-room , Sir , ' says Jonah now , ` I 'm travel-weary ; I need sleep . '' 
`` Thou look ` st like it , ' says the Captain , ` there 's thy room . ' 
Jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key . 
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within . 
All dressed and dusty as he is , Jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead . 
The air is close , and Jonah gasps .
