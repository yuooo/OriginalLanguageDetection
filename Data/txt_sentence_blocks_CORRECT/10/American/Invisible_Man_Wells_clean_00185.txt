The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill , and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright . 
After five minutes , during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future , and lost itself at last over the time dimension , Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh , pulled down the window again , and returned to his writing desk . 
It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang . 
He had been writing slackly , and with intervals of abstraction , since the shots . 
He sat listening . 
He heard the servant answer the door , and waited for her feet on the staircase , but she did not come . 
`` Wonder what that was , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
He tried to resume his work , failed , got up , went downstairs from his study to the landing , rang , and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below . 
`` Was that a letter ? '' 
he asked .
