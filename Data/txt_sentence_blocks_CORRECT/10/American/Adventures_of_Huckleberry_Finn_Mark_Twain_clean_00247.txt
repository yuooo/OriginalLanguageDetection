He ai n't ever told me you was here ; told me to come , and he 'd show me a lot of water-moccasins . 
If anything happens HE ai n't mixed up in it .

I do n't want to talk much about the next day . 
I reckon I 'll cut it pretty short . 
I waked up about dawn , and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was -- did n't seem to be anybody stirring . 
That war n't usual . 
Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone . 
Well , I gets up , a-wondering , and goes down stairs -- nobody around ; everything as still as a mouse . 
Just the same outside .
