Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me . 
Affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance . 
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall . 
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh . 
Oh ! 
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , here lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these . 
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes ! 
What despair in those immovable inscriptions ! 
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave . 
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here .
