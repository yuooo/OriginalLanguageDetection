When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him , he was already so absorbed in his work , pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes , that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table , with some little emphasis perhaps , seeing the state that the floor was in . 
Then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again . 
But she saw he had removed his glasses ; they were beside him on the table , and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow . 
He put on his spectacles again , and then turned and faced her . 
She was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her . 
`` I wish you would n't come in without knocking , '' he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him . 
`` I knocked , but seemingly -- '' `` Perhaps you did . 
But in my investigations -- my really very urgent and necessary investigations -- the slightest disturbance , the jar of a door -- I must ask you -- '' `` Certainly , sir . 
You can turn the lock if you 're like that , you know . 
Any time . ''
