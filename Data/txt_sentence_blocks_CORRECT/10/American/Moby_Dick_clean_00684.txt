But , aside again ! 
here comes that ghost-devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual . 
What does he say , with that look of his ? 
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it . 
Ho ! 
more and more . 
This way comes Pip -- poor boy ! 
would he had died , or I ; he 's half horrible to me . 
He too has been watching all of these interpreters myself included -- and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly idiot face . 
Stand away again and hear him .
