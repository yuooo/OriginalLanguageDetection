Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half-seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly-discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . 
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer 's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over . 
There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God . 
But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror . 
Over Descartian vortices you hover . 
And perhaps , at midday , in the fairest weather , with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever .
