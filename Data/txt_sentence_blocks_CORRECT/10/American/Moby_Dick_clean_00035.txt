I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life . 
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck . 
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer , and his door mat . 
After thinking some time on the bed-side , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking . 
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves . 
But beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as I was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer 's not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , I made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven . 
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but I rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time . 
At last I slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod , when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door . 
Lord save me , thinks I , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head-peddler . 
But I lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to .
