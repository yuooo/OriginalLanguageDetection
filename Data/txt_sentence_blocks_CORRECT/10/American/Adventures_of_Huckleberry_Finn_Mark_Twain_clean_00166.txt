She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her . 
I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still . 
I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could . 
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river . 
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off . 
By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people . 
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars . 
We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives . 
The seegars was prime . 
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .
