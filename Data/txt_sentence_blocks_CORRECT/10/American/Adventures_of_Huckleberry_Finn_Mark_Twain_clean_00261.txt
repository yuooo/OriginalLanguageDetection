`` Old man , '' said the young one , `` I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think ? '' 
`` I ai n't undisposed . 
What 's your line -- mainly ? '' 
`` Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work . 
What 's your lay ? '' 
`` I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time . 
Layin ' on o ' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k 'n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me . 
Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around . '' 
Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : `` Alas ! '' 
`` What 're you alassin ' about ? ''
