`` Why , '' said Stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , `` you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though I do n't pretend to be a judge . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , '' said the Guernsey-man , in French , turning to his captain , `` that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief-mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside . '' 
Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more . 
`` What now ? '' 
said the Guernsey-man to Stubb . 
`` Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I 'm quite certain that he 's no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey . 
In fact , tell him from me he 's a baboon . '' 
`` He vows and declares , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish . '' 
Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship . 
`` What now ? ''
