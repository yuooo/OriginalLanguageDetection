I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week . 
But he said HE was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for HIM . 
When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him . 
So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak . 
And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him . 
The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he 'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it . 
The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again . 
And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : `` Look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take a-hold of it ; shake it . 
There 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it 's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back . 
You mark them words -- do n't forget I said them .
