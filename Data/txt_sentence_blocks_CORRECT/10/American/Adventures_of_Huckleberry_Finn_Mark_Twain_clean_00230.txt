Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing . 
She did n't ever have to stop to think . 
He said she would slap down a line , and if she could n't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead . 
She war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful . 
Every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her `` tribute '' before he was cold . 
She called them tributes . 
The neighbors said it was the doctor first , then Emmeline , then the undertaker -- the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was Whistler . 
She war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long . 
Poor thing , many 's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little . 
I liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us .
