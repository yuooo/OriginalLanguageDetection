I 'll try the bench here . '' 
`` Just as you please ; I 'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it 's a plaguy rough board here '' -- feeling of the knots and notches . 
`` But wait a bit , Skrimshander ; I 've got a carpenter 's plane there in the bar -- wait , I say , and I 'll make ye snug enough . '' 
So saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape . 
The shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot . 
The landlord was near spraining his wrist , and I told him for heaven 's sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank . 
So gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study . 
I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair . 
But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them . 
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
