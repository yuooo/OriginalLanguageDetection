The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire -- which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals , but left his downcast face in darkness -- and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door . 
Everything was ruddy , shadowy , and indistinct to her , the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp , and her eyes were dazzled . 
But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open -- a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face . 
It was the sensation of a moment : the white-bound head , the monstrous goggle eyes , and this huge yawn below it . 
Then he stirred , started up in his chair , put up his hand . 
She opened the door wide , so that the room was lighter , and she saw him more clearly , with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before . 
The shadows , she fancied , had tricked her . 
`` Would you mind , sir , this man a-coming to look at the clock , sir ? '' 
she said , recovering from the momentary shock . 
`` Look at the clock ? ''
