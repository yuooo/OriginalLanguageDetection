Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again . 
Tying these two anchors here , Flask , seems like tying a man 's hands behind him . 
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure . 
These are your iron fists , hey ? 
What a hold they have , too ! 
I wonder , Flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though . 
There , hammer that knot down , and we 've done . 
So ; next to touching land , lighting on deck is the most satisfactory . 
I say , just wring out my jacket skirts , will ye ? 
Thank ye .
