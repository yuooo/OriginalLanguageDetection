Then we struck out , easy and comfortable , for the island where my raft was ; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank , till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out . 
And when we stepped on to the raft I says : `` NOW , old Jim , you 're a free man again , and I bet you wo n't ever be a slave no more . '' 
`` En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck . 
It ` uz planned beautiful , en it ` uz done beautiful ; en dey ai n't NOBODY kin git up a plan dat 's mo ' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz . '' 
We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg . 
When me and Jim heard that we did n't feel so brash as what we did before . 
It was hurting him considerable , and bleeding ; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke 's shirts for to bandage him , but he says : `` Gim me the rags ; I can do it myself . 
Do n't stop now ; do n't fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome ; man the sweeps , and set her loose ! 
Boys , we done it elegant ! 
-- ` deed we did .
