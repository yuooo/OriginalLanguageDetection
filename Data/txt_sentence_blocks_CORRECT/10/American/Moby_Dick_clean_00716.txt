Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo 's . 
In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds . 
King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir Clifford , because he was lord of the seignories of those parts . 
Sir Clifford 's whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw . 
Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side . 
Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead . 
The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm , where I had them tattooed ; as in my wild wanderings at that period , there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics . 
But as I was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale . 
Measurement of The Whale 's Skeleton In the first place , I wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit . 
Such a statement may prove useful here .
