Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself . ' 
`` For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ` What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you ! ' '' 
` Say ye so ? 
then see how ye frighten me ' -- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike . '' 
` Best not , ' hissed the Lakeman . '' 
` But I must , ' -- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke . 
`` Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I wo n't do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d'ye hear ? ' 
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- Radney the chief mate . 
Ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene . 
Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe . ''
