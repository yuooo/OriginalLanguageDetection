Ho , ho ! 
from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death ! 
Towards thee I roll , thou all-destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last I grapple with thee ; from hell 's heart I stab at thee ; for hate 's sake I spit my last breath at thee . 
Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool ! 
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale ! 
Thus , I give up the spear ! '' 
The harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves ; -- ran foul . 
Ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone . 
Next instant , the heavy eye-splice in the rope 's final end flew out of the stark-empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths . 
For an instant , the tranced boat 's crew stood still ; then turned .
