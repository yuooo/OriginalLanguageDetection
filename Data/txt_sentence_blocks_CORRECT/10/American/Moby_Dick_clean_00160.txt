`` Look here , friend , '' said I , `` if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that 's all I have to say . '' 
`` And it 's said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye . 
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning !

`` Morning to ye , shipmates , morning . ''
