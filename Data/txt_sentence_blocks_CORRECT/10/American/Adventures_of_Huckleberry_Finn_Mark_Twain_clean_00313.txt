When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town . 
The third night the house was crammed again -- and they war n't new-comers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights . 
I stood by the duke at the door , and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat -- and I see it war n't no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight . 
I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around , and I bet I do , there was sixty-four of them went in . 
I shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; I could n't stand it . 
Well , when the place could n't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , I after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : `` Walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you ! '' 
I done it , and he done the same . 
We struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word . 
I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : `` Well , how 'd the old thing pan out this time , duke ? '' 
He had n't been up - town at all .
