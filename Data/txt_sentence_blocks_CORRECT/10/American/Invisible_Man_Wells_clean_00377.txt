Then he was hit again under the jaw , and sprawled headlong on the ground . 
In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm , and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat , but the grip of one was weaker than the other ; he grasped the wrists , heard a cry of pain from his assailant , and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him , and struck something with a dull thud . 
He felt a drop of moisture on his face . 
The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed , and with a convulsive effort , Kemp loosed himself , grasped a limp shoulder , and rolled uppermost . 
He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground . 
`` I 've got him ! '' 
screamed Kemp . 
`` Help ! 
Help -- hold ! 
He 's down !
