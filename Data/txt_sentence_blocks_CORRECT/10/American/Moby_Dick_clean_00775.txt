These are the times , when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land-like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure . 
The long-drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill-sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad May-time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked . 
And all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half-way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole . 
Nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab . 
But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing . 
Oh , grassy glades ! 
oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye , -- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthly life , -- in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them . 
Would to God these blessed calms would last . 
But the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm . 
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause : -- through infancy 's unconscious spell , boyhood 's thoughtless faith , adolescence ' doubt -LRB- the common doom -RRB- , then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood 's pondering repose of If .
