But he never heard me . 
He had forgot me and everything else . 
He had his chin in his hand , thinking . 
Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : `` No , it would n't do -- there ai n't necessity enough for it . '' 
`` For what ? '' 
I says . 
`` Why , to saw Jim 's leg off , '' he says . 
`` Good land ! '' 
I says ; `` why , there ai n't NO necessity for it . 
And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway ? ''
