That old fool sold him , and never divided with me , and the money 's gone . ''

Where is he ? 
-- I want my nigger . '' 
`` Well , you ca n't GET your nigger , that 's all -- so dry up your blubbering . 
Looky here -- do you think YOU 'D venture to blow on us ? 
Blamed if I think I 'd trust you . 
Why , if you WAS to blow on us -- '' He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
