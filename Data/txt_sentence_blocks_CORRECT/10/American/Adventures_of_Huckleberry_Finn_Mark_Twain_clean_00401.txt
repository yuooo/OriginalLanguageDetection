So they 'd got to work that off -- I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING . 
Well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out : `` HERE 'S your opposition line ! 
here 's your two sets o ' heirs to old Peter Wilks -- and you pays your money and you takes your choice ! '' 
THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along , and a nice - looking younger one , with his right arm in a sling . 
And , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up . 
But I did n't see no joke about it , and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any . 
I reckoned they 'd turn pale . 
But no , nary a pale did THEY turn . 
The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up , but just went a goo - gooing around , happy and satisfied , like a jug that 's googling out buttermilk ; and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world . 
Oh , he done it admirable .
