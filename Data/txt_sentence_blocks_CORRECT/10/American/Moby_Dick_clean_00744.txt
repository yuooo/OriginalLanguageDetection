And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg , though it be now so long dissolved ; then , why mayest not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ? 
Hah ! 
Good Lord ! 
Truly , sir , if it comes to that , I must calculate over again ; I think I did n't carry a small figure , sir . 
Look ye , pudding-heads should never grant premises . 
-- How long before this leg is done ? 
Perhaps an hour , sir . 
Bungle away at it then , and bring it to me -LRB- turns to go -RRB- . 
Oh , Life . 
Here I am , proud as Greek god , and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on !
