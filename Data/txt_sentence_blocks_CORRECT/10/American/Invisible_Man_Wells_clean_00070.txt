At last he rapped , opened the door , and got as far as , `` Excuse me -- '' `` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the stranger in a tremendous voice , and `` Shut that door after you . '' 
So that brief interview terminated . 
THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER The stranger went into the little parlour of the `` Coach and Horses '' about half-past five in the morning , and there he remained until near midday , the blinds down , the door shut , and none , after Hall 's repulse , venturing near him . 
All that time he must have fasted . 
Thrice he rang his bell , the third time furiously and continuously , but no one answered him . 
`` Him and his ` go to the devil ' indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
Presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage , and two and two were put together . 
Hall , assisted by Wadgers , went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth , the magistrate , and take his advice .
