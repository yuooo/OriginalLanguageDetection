I looked over my shoulder every now and then , but I did n't see nobody . 
I was at Judge Thatcher 's as quick as I could get there . 
He said : `` Why , my boy , you are all out of breath . 
Did you come for your interest ? '' 
`` No , sir , '' I says ; `` is there some for me ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , a half-yearly is in last night -- over a hundred and fifty dollars . 
Quite a fortune for you . 
You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you 'll spend it . '' 
`` No , sir , '' I says , `` I do n't want to spend it . 
I do n't want it at all -- nor the six thousand , nuther .
