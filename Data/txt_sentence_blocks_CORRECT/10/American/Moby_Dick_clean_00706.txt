But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of -- not all though -- were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ? 
I will tell you . 
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research . 
Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed . 
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders , Zealanders , and Danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink . 
For , as a general thing , the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the English whaler . 
Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated . 
During my researches in the Leviathanic histories , I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers . 
The title was , `` Dan Coopman , '' wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper . 
I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one `` Fitz Swackhammer . ''
