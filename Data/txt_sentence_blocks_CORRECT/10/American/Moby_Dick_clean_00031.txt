shouted I. `` With heads to be sure ; ai n't there too many heads in the world ? '' 
`` I tell you what it is , landlord , '' said I quite calmly , `` you 'd better stop spinning that yarn to me -- I 'm not green . '' 
`` May be not , '' taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick , `` but I rayther guess you 'll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin ' his head . '' 
`` I 'll break it for him , '' said I , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord 's . 
`` It 's broke a ` ready , '' said he . 
`` Broke , '' said I -- `` broke , do you mean ? '' 
`` Sartain , and that 's the very reason he ca n't sell it , I guess . '' 
`` Landlord , '' said I , going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snowstorm -- `` landlord , stop whittling . 
You and I must understand one another , and that too without delay . 
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
