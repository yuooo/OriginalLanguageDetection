`` How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ? '' 
`` Do you see that mainmast there ? '' 
pointing to the ship ; `` well , that 's the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod 's hold , and string 'em along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that would n't begin to be Fedallah 's age . 
Nor all the coopers in creation could n't show hoops enough to make oughts enough . '' 
`` But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss , if you got a good chance . 
Now , if he 's so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ? 
`` Give him a good ducking , anyhow . '' 
`` But he 'd crawl back . '' 
`` Duck him again ; and keep ducking him . '' 
`` Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ? ''
