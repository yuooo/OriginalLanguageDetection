Well , what did he do ? 
Ask him to show up ? 
No -- drownded him in a butt of mamsey , like a cat . 
S'pose people left money laying around where he was -- what did he do ? 
He collared it . 
S'pose he contracted to do a thing , and you paid him , and did n't set down there and see that he done it -- what did he do ? 
He always done the other thing . 
S'pose he opened his mouth -- what then ? 
If he did n't shut it up powerful quick he 'd lose a lie every time . 
That 's the kind of a bug Henry was ; and if we 'd a had him along ` stead of our kings he 'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done .
