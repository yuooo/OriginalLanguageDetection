Then the armchair creaked as he sat down again . 
MR. TEDDY HENFREY 'S FIRST IMPRESSIONS At four o'clock , when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea , Teddy Henfrey , the clock-jobber , came into the bar . 
`` My sakes ! 
Mrs. Hall , '' said he , `` but this is terrible weather for thin boots ! '' 
The snow outside was falling faster . 
Mrs. Hall agreed , and then noticed he had his bag with him . 
`` Now you 're here , Mr. Teddy , '' said she , `` I 'd be glad if you 'd give th ' old clock in the parlour a bit of a look . 
'T is going , and it strikes well and hearty ; but the hour-hand wo n't do nuthin ' but point at six . '' 
And leading the way , she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered . 
Her visitor , she saw as she opened the door , was seated in the armchair before the fire , dozing it would seem , with his bandaged head drooping on one side .
