`` What 's a feud ? '' 
`` Why , where was you raised ? 
Do n't you know what a feud is ? '' 
`` Never heard of it before -- tell me about it . '' 
`` Well , '' says Buck , `` a feud is this way : A man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills HIM ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the COUSINS chip in -- and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ai n't no more feud . 
But it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time . '' 
`` Has this one been going on long , Buck ? '' 
`` Well , I should RECKON ! 
It started thirty year ago , or som ` ers along there . 
There was trouble ` bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit -- which he would naturally do , of course .
