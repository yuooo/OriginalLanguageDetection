By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool . 
She never told me why , and I could n't make it out no way . 
I set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it . 
I says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why do n't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork ? 
Why ca n't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ? 
Why ca n't Miss Watson fat up ? 
No , says I to my self , there ai n't nothing in it . 
I went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was `` spiritual gifts . '' 
This was too many for me , but she told me what she meant -- I must help other people , and do everything I could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself . 
This was including Miss Watson , as I took it .
