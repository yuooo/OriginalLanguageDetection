Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again . ' 
`` Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . 
Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green-turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck . 
But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed . 
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features . 
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities . 
Once a vagabond on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one . 
In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains . 
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas .

I see !
