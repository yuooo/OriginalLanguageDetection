IN OXFORD STREET `` In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty because I could not see my feet ; indeed I stumbled twice , and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt . 
By not looking down , however , I managed to walk on the level passably well . 
`` My mood , I say , was one of exaltation . 
I felt as a seeing man might do , with padded feet and noiseless clothes , in a city of the blind . 
I experienced a wild impulse to jest , to startle people , to clap men on the back , fling people 's hats astray , and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage . 
`` But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street , however -LRB- my lodging was close to the big draper 's shop there -RRB- , when I heard a clashing concussion and was hit violently behind , and turning saw a man carrying a basket of soda-water syphons , and looking in amazement at his burden . 
Although the blow had really hurt me , I found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud . 
` The devil 's in the basket , ' I said , and suddenly twisted it out of his hand . 
He let go incontinently , and I swung the whole weight into the air .
