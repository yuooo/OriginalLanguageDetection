thought I , ha , as the flying particles almost choked me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , Gomorrah ? 
But `` The Crossed Harpoons , '' and the `` The Sword-Fish ? '' 
-- this , then must needs be the sign of `` The Trap . '' 
However , I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door . 
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet . 
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit . 
It was a negro church ; and the preacher 's text was about the blackness of darkness , and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there . 
Ha , Ishmael , muttered I , backing out , Wretched entertainment at the sign of ` The Trap ! ' 
Moving on , I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath -- `` The Spouter Inn : -- Peter Coffin . '' 
Coffin ?
