`` Asses ! '' 
said Dr. Kemp , swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writing-table . 
But those who saw the fugitive nearer , and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face , being themselves in the open roadway , did not share in the doctor 's contempt . 
By the man pounded , and as he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro . 
He looked neither to the right nor the left , but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit , and the people were crowded in the street . 
And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart , and a glairy foam lay on his lips , and his breath came hoarse and noisy . 
All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down , and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste . 
And then presently , far up the hill , a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate , and as they still wondered something -- a wind -- a pad , pad , pad , -- a sound like a panting breathing , rushed by . 
People screamed . 
People sprang off the pavement : It passed in shouts , it passed by instinct down the hill .
