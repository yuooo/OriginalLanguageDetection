Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still pricking him at times . 
May I humbly ask if it be really so , sir ? 
It is , man . 
Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul . 
Where thou feelest tingling life ; there , exactly there , there to a hair , do I. Is ' t a riddle ? 
I should humbly call it a poser , sir . 
Hist , then . 
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ? 
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear eavesdroppers ? 
Hold , do n't speak !
