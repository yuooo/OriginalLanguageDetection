`` I 'll have them nicely dried , sir , at once , '' she said , and carried his clothes out of the room . 
She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door ; but his napkin was still in front of his face . 
She shivered a little as she closed the door behind her , and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity . 
`` I never , '' she whispered . 
`` There ! '' 
She went quite softly to the kitchen , and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing about with now , when she got there . 
The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet . 
He glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette , and resumed his meal . 
He took a mouthful , glanced suspiciously at the window , took another mouthful , then rose and , taking the serviette in his hand , walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes . 
This left the room in a twilight .
