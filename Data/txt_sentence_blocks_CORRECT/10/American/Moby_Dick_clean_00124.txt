`` He says he 's our man , Bildad , '' said Peleg , `` he wants to ship . '' 
`` Dost thee ? '' 
said Bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me . 
`` I dost , '' said I unconsciously , he was so intense a Quaker . 
`` What do ye think of him , Bildad ? '' 
said Peleg . 
`` He 'll do , '' said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible . 
I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw , especially as Peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a blusterer . 
But I said nothing , only looking round me sharply . 
Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship 's articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table .
