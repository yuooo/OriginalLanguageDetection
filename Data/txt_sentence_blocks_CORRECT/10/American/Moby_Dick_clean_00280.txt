Yet is there hope . 
Time and tide flow wide . 
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe . 
His heaven-insulting purpose , God may wedge aside . 
I would up heart , were it not like lead . 
But my whole clock 's run down ; my heart the all-controlling weight , I have no key to lift again . 
-LSB- A burst of revelry from the forecastle . -RSB- 
Oh , God ! 
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! 
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea .
