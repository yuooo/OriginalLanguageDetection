They 'll shake their tassels soon . 
Now would all the waves were women , then I 'd go drown , and chassee with them evermore ! 
There 's naught so sweet on earth -- heaven may not match it ! 
-- as those swift glances of warm , wild bosoms in the dance , when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe , bursting grapes . 
SICILIAN SAILOR -LRB- Reclining -RRB- Tell me not of it ! 
Hark ye , lad -- fleet interlacings of the limbs -- lithe swayings -- coyings -- flutterings ! 
lip ! 
heart ! 
hip ! 
all graze : unceasing touch and go !
