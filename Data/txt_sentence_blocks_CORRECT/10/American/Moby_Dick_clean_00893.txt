By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him . 
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault . 
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus 's elephants in the book of Maccabees . 
Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale 's insolent tail , and too much of a cripple to swim , -- though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless Ahab 's head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst . 
From the boat 's fragmentary stern , Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves . 
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale 's aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them . 
And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape . 
With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man 's head . 
Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship 's mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her ! 
-- `` Sail on the '' -- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and whelmed him for the time .
