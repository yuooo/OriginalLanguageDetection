Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ? 
-- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes ? 
Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ? 
No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound . 
Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are . 
Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there 's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is . 
It 's gaudy , Huck . 
I wish there was a moat to this cabin . 
If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one . '' 
I says : `` What do we want of a moat when we 're going to snake him out from under the cabin ? ''
