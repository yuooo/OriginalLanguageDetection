I heard a miaow behind me , and turning , saw a lean white cat , very dirty , on the cistern cover outside the window . 
A thought came into my head . 
` Everything ready for you , ' I said , and went to the window , opened it , and called softly . 
She came in , purring -- the poor beast was starving -- and I gave her some milk . 
All my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room . 
After that she went smelling round the room , evidently with the idea of making herself at home . 
The invisible rag upset her a bit ; you should have seen her spit at it ! 
But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed . 
And I gave her butter to get her to wash . '' 
`` And you processed her ? ''
