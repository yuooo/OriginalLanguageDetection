But it ought n't to be altogether my fault , because , you know , I do n't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they 're on me ; and I do n't believe I 've ever lost one of them OFF of me . '' 
`` Well , it ai n't YOUR fault if you have n't , Silas ; you 'd a done it if you could , I reckon . 
And the shirt ai n't all that 's gone , nuther . 
Ther 's a spoon gone ; and THAT ai n't all . 
There was ten , and now ther 's only nine . 
The calf got the shirt , I reckon , but the calf never took the spoon , THAT 'S certain . '' 
`` Why , what else is gone , Sally ? '' 
`` Ther 's six CANDLES gone -- that 's what . 
The rats could a got the candles , and I reckon they did ; I wonder they do n't walk off with the whole place , the way you 're always going to stop their holes and do n't do it ; and if they war n't fools they 'd sleep in your hair , Silas -- YOU 'D never find it out ; but you ca n't lay the SPOON on the rats , and that I know . '' 
`` Well , Sally , I 'm in fault , and I acknowledge it ; I 've been remiss ; but I wo n't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes . ''
