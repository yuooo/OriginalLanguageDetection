`` Lock him out , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Do n't let him come in again . 
I half guessed -- I might ha ' known . 
With them goggling eyes and bandaged head , and never going to church of a Sunday . 
And all they bottles -- more 'n it 's right for any one to have . 
He 's put the sperits into the furniture ... . 
My good old furniture ! 
'T was in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl . 
To think it should rise up against me now ! '' 
`` Just a drop more , Janny , '' said Hall .
