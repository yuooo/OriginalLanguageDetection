If we was to put in another night this way we 'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well -- could n't touch a case-knife with them sooner . '' 
`` Well , then , what we going to do , Tom ? '' 
`` I 'll tell you . 
It ai n't right , and it ai n't moral , and I would n't like it to get out ; but there ai n't only just the one way : we got to dig him out with the picks , and LET ON it 's case-knives . '' 
`` NOW you 're TALKING ! '' 
I says ; `` your head gets leveler and leveler all the time , Tom Sawyer , '' I says . 
`` Picks is the thing , moral or no moral ; and as for me , I do n't care shucks for the morality of it , nohow . 
When I start in to steal a nigger , or a watermelon , or a Sunday-school book , I ai n't no ways particular how it 's done so it 's done . 
What I want is my nigger ; or what I want is my watermelon ; or what I want is my Sunday - school book ; and if a pick 's the handiest thing , that 's the thing I 'm a - going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with ; and I do n't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther . '' 
`` Well , '' he says , `` there 's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this ; if it war n't so , I would n't approve of it , nor I would n't stand by and see the rules broke -- because right is right , and wrong is wrong , and a body ai n't got no business doing wrong when he ai n't ignorant and knows better .
