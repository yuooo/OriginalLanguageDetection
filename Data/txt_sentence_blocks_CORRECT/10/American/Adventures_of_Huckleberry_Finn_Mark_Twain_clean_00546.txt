It 's always called so when a king escapes , f ` rinstance . 
And the same with a king 's son ; it do n't make no difference whether he 's a natural one or an unnatural one . '' 
So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter , and I smouched the yaller wench 's frock that night , and put it on , and shoved it under the front door , the way Tom told me to . 
It said : Beware . 
Trouble is brewing . 
Keep a sharp lookout . 
UNKNOWN FRIEND . 
Next night we stuck a picture , which Tom drawed in blood , of a skull and crossbones on the front door ; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door . 
I never see a family in such a sweat . 
They could n't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air .
