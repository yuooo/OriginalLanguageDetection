We war n't going to borrow it when there war n't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us . 
So we shoved out after dark on the raft . 
Anybody that do n't believe yet that it 's foolishness to handle a snake - skin , after all that that snake-skin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us . 
The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore . 
But we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more . 
Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog . 
You ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance . 
It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river . 
We lit the lantern , and judged she would see it . 
Up-stream boats did n't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
