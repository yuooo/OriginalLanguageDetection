Then , as recollection came back to me , I heard voices in conversation . 
`` Then far down the place , in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds , I saw two men approaching . 
I scrambled to my feet , looking about me for some way of escape , and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me . 
I suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away . 
` Who 's that ? ' 
cried one , and ` Stop , there ! ' 
shouted the other . 
I dashed around a corner and came full tilt -- a faceless figure , mind you ! 
-- on a lanky lad of fifteen . 
He yelled and I bowled him over , rushed past him , turned another corner , and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter .
