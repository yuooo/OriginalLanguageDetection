The centre of his face became a black cavity . 
`` Here , '' he said . 
He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she , staring at his metamorphosed face , accepted automatically . 
Then , when she saw what it was , she screamed loudly , dropped it , and staggered back .

pink and shining -- rolled on the floor . 
Then he removed his spectacles , and everyone in the bar gasped . 
He took off his hat , and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages . 
For a moment they resisted him . 
A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar .
