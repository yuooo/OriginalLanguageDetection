`` Pray God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab . 
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ? '' 
`` For the white fiend ! 
But now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man . 
Here are my razors -- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea . '' 
For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them . 
`` Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither shave , sup , nor pray till -- but here -- to work ! '' 
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by Perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near . 
`` No , no -- no water for that ; I want it of the true death-temper . 
Ahoy , there !
