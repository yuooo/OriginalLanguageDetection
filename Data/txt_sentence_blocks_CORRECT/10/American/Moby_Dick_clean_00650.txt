The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is . 
Now , in general , Stick to the boat , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat , is still better . 
Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command `` Stick to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I wo n't pick you up if you jump ; mind that . 
We ca n't afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama . 
Bear that in mind , and do n't jump any more . '' 
Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money-making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence . 
But we are all in the hands of the Gods ; and Pip jumped again . 
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller 's trunk . 
Alas ! 
Stubb was but too true to his word .
