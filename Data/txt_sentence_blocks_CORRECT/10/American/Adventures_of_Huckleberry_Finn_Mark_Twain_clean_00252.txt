I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia . 
He said they 'd got across the river and was safe . 
I was glad of that ; but the way Buck did take on because he did n't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him -- I hai n't ever heard anything like it . 
All of a sudden , bang ! 
bang ! 
bang ! 
goes three or four guns -- the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses ! 
The boys jumped for the river -- both of them hurt -- and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , `` Kill them , kill them ! '' 
It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree . 
I ai n't a-going to tell ALL that happened -- it would make me sick again if I was to do that .
