In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale . 
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket . 
In a word , Frederick Cuvier 's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash . 
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage -LRB- such men seldom have -RRB- , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ? 
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing . 
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us . 
As for the sign-painters ' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers , what shall be said of them ? 
They are generally Richard III . 
whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint . 
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all .
