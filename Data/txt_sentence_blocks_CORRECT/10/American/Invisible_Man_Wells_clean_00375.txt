Further on the astonished features of navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel . 
His pace broke a little , and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer , and leapt forward again . 
`` The Invisible Man ! '' 
he cried to the navvies , with a vague indicative gesture , and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase . 
Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street , rushed by a greengrocer 's cart , hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop , and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again . 
Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts . 
Out he shot into Hill Street again , three hundred yards from the tram-line end , and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people . 
He glanced up the street towards the hill . 
Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy , cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade , and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched . 
Up the street others followed these two , striking and shouting .
