`` Hast seen the White Whale ? '' 
`` Look ! '' 
replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck . 
`` Hast killed him ? '' 
`` The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever will do that , '' answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together . 
`` Not forged ! '' 
and snatching Perth 's levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , exclaiming -- `` Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death ! 
Tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the White Whale most feels his accursed life ! '' 
`` Then God keep thee , old man -- see ` st thou that '' -- pointing to the hammock -- `` I bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night . 
Only that one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb . ''
