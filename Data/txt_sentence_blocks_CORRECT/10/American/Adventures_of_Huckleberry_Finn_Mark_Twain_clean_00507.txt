Then he says : `` Now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to Jim . '' 
`` Take them in through the hole , '' I says , `` when we get it done . '' 
He only just looked scornful , and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea , and then he went to studying . 
By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways , but there war n't no need to decide on any of them yet . 
Said we 'd got to post Jim first . 
That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten , and took one of the candles along , and listened under the window-hole , and heard Jim snoring ; so we pitched it in , and it did n't wake him . 
Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel , and in about two hours and a half the job was done . 
We crept in under Jim 's bed and into the cabin , and pawed around and found the candle and lit it , and stood over Jim awhile , and found him looking hearty and healthy , and then we woke him up gentle and gradual . 
He was so glad to see us he most cried ; and called us honey , and all the pet names he could think of ; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away , and clearing out without losing any time . 
But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be , and set down and told him all about our plans , and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ; and not to be the least afraid , because we would see he got away , SURE .
