And I worked three years , and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its summit . 
The infinite details ! 
And the exasperation ! 
A professor , a provincial professor , always prying . 
` When are you going to publish this work of yours ? ' 
was his everlasting question . 
And the students , the cramped means ! 
Three years I had of it -- `` And after three years of secrecy and exasperation , I found that to complete it was impossible -- impossible . '' 
`` How ? '' 
asked Kemp .
