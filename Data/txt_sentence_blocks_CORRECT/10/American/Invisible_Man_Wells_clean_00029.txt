He caught a glimpse of a most singular thing , what seemed a handless arm waving towards him , and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white , very like the face of a pale pansy . 
Then he was struck violently in the chest , hurled back , and the door slammed in his face and locked . 
It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe . 
A waving of indecipherable shapes , a blow , and a concussion . 
There he stood on the dark little landing , wondering what it might be that he had seen .

'' 
and so forth . 
Mr. Hall , staring at them from the steps and listening , found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs . 
Besides , his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions .
