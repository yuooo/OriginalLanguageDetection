The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the `` Coach and Horses , '' and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble . 
He it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins ' cottage on the Adderdean road . 
And after that , as his peculiar qualities allowed , he passed out of human perceptions altogether , and he was neither heard , seen , nor felt in Iping any more . 
He vanished absolutely . 
But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street . 
MR. MARVEL DISCUSSES HIS RESIGNATION When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday , a short , thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst . 
He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature , and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth . 
His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue ; he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry . 
He was accompanied by a voice other than his own , and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands . 
`` If you give me the slip again , '' said the Voice , `` if you attempt to give me the slip again -- '' `` Lord ! ''
