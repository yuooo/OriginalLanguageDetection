`` Aye , aye ! '' 
cried Stubb , `` I knew it -- ye ca n't escape -- blow on and split your spout , O whale ! 
the mad fiend himself is after ye ! 
blow your trump -- blister your lungs ! 
-- Ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream ! '' 
And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew . 
The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up , like old wine worked anew . 
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison . 
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night 's suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along . 
The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race .
