All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs . 
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other 's grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon . 
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used . 
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time . 
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can . 
And if you can not kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure . 
Hence it is , that at times like these the drug , comes into requisition . 
Our boat was furnished with three of them . 
The first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg . 
They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball .
