He saw God 's foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad . 
So man 's insanity is heaven 's sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his God . 
For the rest blame not Stubb too hardly . 
The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself . 
A Squeeze of the Hand That whale of Stubb 's , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the Pequod 's side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun , or Case . 
While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works , of which anon . 
It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large Constantine 's bath of it , I found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part . 
It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid . 
A sweet and unctuous duty ! 
No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favorite cosmetic .
