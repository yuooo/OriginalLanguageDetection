At that he returned to his bedroom , armed himself with the most obvious weapon , the poker , and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible . 
Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing . 
The hour was about four , and the ultimate darkness of the night was past . 
There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall , but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black . 
Everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting 's tread , and the slight movements in the study . 
Then something snapped , the drawer was opened , and there was a rustle of papers . 
Then came an imprecation , and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light . 
Mr. Bunting was now in the hall , and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk . 
But the robber he could not see . 
He stood there in the hall undecided what to do , and Mrs. Bunting , her face white and intent , crept slowly downstairs after him .
