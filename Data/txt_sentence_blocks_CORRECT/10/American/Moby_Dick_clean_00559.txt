Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys . 
It 's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ? 
it must be , he 's lost his tiller . '' 
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin . 
Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say . 
`` Only wait a bit , old chap , and I 'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm , '' cried cruel Flask , pointing to the whale-line near him . 
`` Mind he do n't sling thee with it , '' cried Starbuck . 
`` Give way , or the German will have him . '' 
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time . 
At this juncture , the Pequod 's keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick 's boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals .
