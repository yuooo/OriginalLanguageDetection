I stopped the gas engine , felt for and stroked the beast , which was still insensible , and then , being tired , left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed . 
I found it hard to sleep . 
I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff , going over the experiment over and over again , or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me , until everything , the ground I stood on , vanished , and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets . 
About two , the cat began miaowing about the room . 
I tried to hush it by talking to it , and then I decided to turn it out . 
I remember the shock I had when striking a light -- there were just the round eyes shining green -- and nothing round them . 
I would have given it milk , but I had n't any . 
It would n't be quiet , it just sat down and miaowed at the door . 
I tried to catch it , with an idea of putting it out of the window , but it would n't be caught , it vanished . 
Then it began miaowing in different parts of the room .
