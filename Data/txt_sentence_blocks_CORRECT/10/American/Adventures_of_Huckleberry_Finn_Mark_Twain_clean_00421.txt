But that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools had n't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we 'd a slept in our cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to WEAR , too -- longer than WE 'D need 'em . ''

And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it ! ''

After about a half a minute the king drawls out : `` Leastways , I did . '' 
The duke says , the same way : `` On the contrary , I did . '' 
The king kind of ruffles up , and says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to ? '' 
The duke says , pretty brisk : `` When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was YOU referring to ? ''
