At the time , I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and Platonic application ; and , furthermore , I compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock-fish , & c. , consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery . 
In the first place , the amount of butter , and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing . 
I impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil . 
The quantity of the beer , too , is very large , 10,800 barrels . 
Now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks ' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin . 
Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat 's head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable . 
Yet they did aim at them , and hit them too . 
But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford . 
But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example . 
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
