By and by I was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground . 
It most give me the fantods . 
He had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire . 
I set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady . 
It was getting gray daylight now . 
Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was Miss Watson 's Jim ! 
I bet I was glad to see him . 
I says : `` Hello , Jim ! '' 
and skipped out . 
He bounced up and stared at me wild .
