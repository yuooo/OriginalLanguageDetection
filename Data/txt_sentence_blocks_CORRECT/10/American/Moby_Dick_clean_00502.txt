demanded Ahab , when the boat drifted back . 
`` Think , think of thy whale-boat , stoven and sunk ! 
Beware of the horrible tail ! '' 
`` I tell thee again , Gabriel , that - '' But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends . 
Nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling , not heaving it . 
Meantime , the hoisted sperm whale 's head jogged about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant . 
When this interlude was over , Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick ; not , however , without frequent interruptions from Gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him . 
It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale-ship , her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick , and the havoc he had made . 
Greedily sucking in this intelligence , Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his gibbering insanity , pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated ; the Shakers receiving the Bible . 
But when , some year or two afterwards , Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads , Macey , the chief mate , burned with ardor to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel 's denunciations and forewarnings , Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat .
