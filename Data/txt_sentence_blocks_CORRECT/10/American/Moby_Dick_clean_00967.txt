`` In the free element beneath me swam , Floundered and dived , in play , in chace , in battle , Fishes of every color , form , and kind ; Which language can not paint , and mariner Had never seen ; from dread Leviathan To insect millions peopling every wave : Gather 'd in shoals immense , like floating islands , Led by mysterious instincts through that waste And trackless region , though on every side Assaulted by voracious enemies , Whales , sharks , and monsters , arm 'd in front or jaw , With swords , saws , spiral horns , or hooked fangs .
