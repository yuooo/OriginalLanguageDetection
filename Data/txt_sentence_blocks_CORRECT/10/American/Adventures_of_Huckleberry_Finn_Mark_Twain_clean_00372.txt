A little thing like that do n't cost nothing , and it 's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked . 
There war n't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was . 
Well , the funeral sermon was very good , but pison long and tiresome ; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage , and at last the job was through , and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver . 
I was in a sweat then , and watched him pretty keen . 
But he never meddled at all ; just slid the lid along as soft as mush , and screwed it down tight and fast . 
So there I was ! 
I did n't know whether the money was in there or not . 
So , says I , s ` pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly ? 
-- now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not ? 
S'pose she dug him up and did n't find nothing , what would she think of me ?
