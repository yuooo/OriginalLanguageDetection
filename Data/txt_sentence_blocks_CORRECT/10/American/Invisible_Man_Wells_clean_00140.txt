He yelled , struggled to regain his feet , was knocked against and thrown on all fours again , and became aware that he was involved not in a capture , but a rout . 
Everyone was running back to the village . 
He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear . 
He staggered and set off back to the `` Coach and Horses '' forthwith , leaping over the deserted Huxter , who was now sitting up , on his way . 
Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage , rising sharply out of the confusion of cries , and a sounding smack in someone 's face . 
He recognised the voice as that of the Invisible Man , and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow . 
In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour . 
`` He 's coming back , Bunting ! '' 
he said , rushing in . 
`` Save yourself ! ''
