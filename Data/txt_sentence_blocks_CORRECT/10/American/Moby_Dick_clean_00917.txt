I feel strained , half-stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so . 
But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear that , know that Ahab 's hawser tows his purpose yet . 
Believe ye , men , in the things called omens ? 
Then laugh aloud , and cry encore ! 
For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore . 
So with Moby Dick -- two days he 's floated -- to-morrow will be the third . 
Aye , men , he 'll rise once more , -- but only to spout his last ! 
D'ye feel brave men , brave ? '' 
`` As fearless fire , '' cried Stubb . 
`` And as mechanical , '' muttered Ahab .
