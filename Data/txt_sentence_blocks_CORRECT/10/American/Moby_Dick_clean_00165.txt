Going Aboard It was nearly six o'clock , but only grey imperfect misty dawn , when we drew nigh the wharf . 
`` There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right , '' said I to Queequeg , `` it ca n't be shadows ; she 's off by sunrise , I guess ; come on ! '' 
`` Avast ! '' 
cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me . 
It was Elijah . 
`` Going aboard ? '' 
`` Hands off , will you , '' said I. `` Lookee here , '' said Queequeg , shaking himself , `` go ` way ! '' 
`` Aint going aboard , then ? '' 
`` Yes , we are , '' said I , `` but what business is that of yours ? 
Do you know , Mr. Elijah , that I consider you a little impertinent ? ''
