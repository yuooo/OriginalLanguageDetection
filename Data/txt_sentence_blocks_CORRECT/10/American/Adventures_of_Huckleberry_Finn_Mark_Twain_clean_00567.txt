What HAS become of that boy ? '' 
I see my chance ; so I skips up and says : `` I 'll run right up to town and get him , '' I says . 
`` No you wo n't , '' she says . 
`` You 'll stay right wher ' you are ; ONE 'S enough to be lost at a time . 
If he ai n't here to supper , your uncle 'll go . '' 
Well , he war n't there to supper ; so right after supper uncle went . 
He come back about ten a little bit uneasy ; had n't run across Tom 's track . 
Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy ; but Uncle Silas he said there war n't no occasion to be -- boys will be boys , he said , and you 'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right . 
So she had to be satisfied . 
But she said she 'd set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it .
