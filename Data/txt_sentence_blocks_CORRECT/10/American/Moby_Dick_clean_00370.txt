`` That 's his hump . 
There , there , give it to him ! '' 
whispered Starbuck . 
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg . 
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us . 
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall . 
Squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped . 
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed . 
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places . 
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .
