But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this `` holding on , '' as it is called ; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes . 
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted . 
Because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense . 
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above-ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean ! 
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres . 
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board . 
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony ! 
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows . 
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock . 
Suspended ?
