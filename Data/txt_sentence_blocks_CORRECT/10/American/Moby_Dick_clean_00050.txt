Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept . 
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal 's baton . 
Breakfast I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly . 
I cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow . 
However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more 's the pity . 
So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and to be spent in that way . 
And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for . 
The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at . 
They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns . 
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .
