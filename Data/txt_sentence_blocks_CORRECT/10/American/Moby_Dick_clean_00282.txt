Oh , life ! 
't is in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , -- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life ! 
't is now that I do feel the latent horror in thee ! 
but 't is not me ! 
that horror 's out of me , and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! 
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences ! 
First Night Watch -LRB- Stubb solus , and mending a brace . -RRB- 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha !
