`` I reckon he WAR N'T a coward . 
Not by a blame ' sight . 
There ai n't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons -- not a one . 
And there ai n't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either . 
Why , that old man kep ' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords , and come out winner . 
They was all a-horseback ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep ' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them . 
Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home -- and one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day . 
No , sir ; if a body 's out hunting for cowards he do n't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons , becuz they do n't breed any of that KIND . '' 
Next Sunday we all went to church , about three mile , everybody a - horseback . 
The men took their guns along , so did Buck , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall .
