I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon , and camped on a piece of a raft we found , and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams , for it went off and shot him in the leg , and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it , nor let anybody know , because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks . 
`` Who is your folks ? '' 
he says . 
`` The Phelpses , down yonder . '' 
`` Oh , '' he says . 
And after a minute , he says : `` How 'd you say he got shot ? '' 
`` He had a dream , '' I says , `` and it shot him . '' 
`` Singular dream , '' he says . 
So he lit up his lantern , and got his saddle-bags , and we started . 
But when he sees the canoe he did n't like the look of her -- said she was big enough for one , but did n't look pretty safe for two .
