It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there . 
Also , that in Henry VIIIth 's time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . 
Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . 
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls . 
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them . 
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown . 
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite . 
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious . 
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil . 
Zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing .
