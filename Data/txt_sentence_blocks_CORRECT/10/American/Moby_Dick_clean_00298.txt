DANISH SAILOR Crack , crack , old ship ! 
so long as thou crackest , thou holdest ! 
Well done ! 
The mate there holds ye to it stiffly . 
He 's no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat , put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns , on which the sea-salt cakes ! 
4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR He has his orders , mind ye that . 
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall , something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol -- fire your ship right into it ! 
ENGLISH SAILOR Blood ! 
but that old man 's a grand old cove ! 
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale !
