`` You may well exclaim . 
I remember that night . 
It was late at night -- in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping , silly students -- and I worked then sometimes till dawn . 
It came suddenly , splendid and complete in my mind . 
I was alone ; the laboratory was still , with the tall lights burning brightly and silently . 
In all my great moments I have been alone . 
` One could make an animal -- a tissue -- transparent ! 
One could make it invisible ! 
All except the pigments -- I could be invisible ! ' 
I said , suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge .
