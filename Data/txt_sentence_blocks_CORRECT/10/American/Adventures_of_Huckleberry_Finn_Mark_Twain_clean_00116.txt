He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too . 
He said that that would help . 
Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for I war n't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault , not if I could help it . 
Jim sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again . 
His foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so I judged he was all right ; but I 'd druther been bit with a snake than pap 's whisky . 
Jim was laid up for four days and nights . 
Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again . 
I made up my mind I would n't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands , now that I see what had come of it . 
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time . 
And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we had n't got to the end of it yet .
