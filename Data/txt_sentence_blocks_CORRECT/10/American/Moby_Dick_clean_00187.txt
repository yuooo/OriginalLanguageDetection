Who but mighty Job ? 
And who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage ? 
Who , but no less a prince than Alfred the Great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from Other , the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times ! 
And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament ? 
Who , but Edmund Burke ! 
True enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins . 
No good blood in their veins ? 
They have something better than royal blood there . 
The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel ; afterwards , by marriage , Mary Folger , one of the old settlers of Nantucket , and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers -- all kith and kin to noble Benjamin -- this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other . 
Good again ; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable .
