Though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well . 
I then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale . 
Of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman 's bag , containing the harpooneer 's wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk . 
Likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed . 
But what is this on the chest ? 
I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it . 
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin . 
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American ponchos . 
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ? 
I put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day .
