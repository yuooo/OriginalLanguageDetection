His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him , but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make neither head nor tail of what she heard . 
He rarely went abroad by daylight , but at twilight he would go out muffled up invisibly , whether the weather were cold or not , and he chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks . 
His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat , came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two home-going labourers , and Teddy Henfrey , tumbling out of the `` Scarlet Coat '' one night , at half-past nine , was scared shamefully by the stranger 's skull-like head -LRB- he was walking hat in hand -RRB- lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door . 
Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies , and it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him , or the reverse ; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side . 
It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping . 
Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation . 
Mrs. Hall was sensitive on the point . 
When questioned , she explained very carefully that he was an `` experimental investigator , '' going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls . 
When asked what an experimental investigator was , she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that , and would thus explain that he `` discovered things . '' 
Her visitor had had an accident , she said , which temporarily discoloured his face and hands , and being of a sensitive disposition , he was averse to any public notice of the fact .
