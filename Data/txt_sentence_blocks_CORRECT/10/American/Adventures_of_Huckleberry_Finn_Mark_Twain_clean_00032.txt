I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence . 
There was an inch of new snow on the ground , and I seen somebody 's tracks . 
They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence . 
It was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so . 
I could n't make it out . 
It was very curious , somehow . 
I was going to follow around , but I stooped down to look at the tracks first . 
I did n't notice anything at first , but next I did . 
There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails , to keep off the devil . 
I was up in a second and shinning down the hill .
