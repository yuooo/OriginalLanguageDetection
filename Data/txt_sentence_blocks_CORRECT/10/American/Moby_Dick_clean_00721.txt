But when Leviathan is the text , the case is altered . 
Fain am I to stagger to this enterprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary . 
And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer 's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me . 
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one . 
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ? 
Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals . 
Give me a condor 's quill ! 
Give me Vesuvius ' crater for an inkstand ! 
Friends , hold my arms ! 
For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the sciences , and all the generations of whales , and men , and mastodons , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not excluding its suburbs .
