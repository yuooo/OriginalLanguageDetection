Although the fire was burning up briskly , she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat , standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard . 
His gloved hands were clasped behind him , and he seemed to be lost in thought . 
She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet . 
`` Can I take your hat and coat , sir ? '' 
she said , `` and give them a good dry in the kitchen ? '' 
`` No , '' he said without turning . 
She was not sure she had heard him , and was about to repeat her question . 
He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder . 
`` I prefer to keep them on , '' he said with emphasis , and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights , and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face . 
`` Very well , sir , '' she said .
