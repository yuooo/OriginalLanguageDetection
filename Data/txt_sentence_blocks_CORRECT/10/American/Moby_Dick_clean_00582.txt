I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy . 
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest , this very idea of Jonah 's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle . 
And so it was . 
Besides , to this day , the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah . 
And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris 's Voyages , speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah , in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil . 
Pitchpoling To make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom . 
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely . 
Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat , and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that occupation ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft 's bald keel . 
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment . 
Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event .
