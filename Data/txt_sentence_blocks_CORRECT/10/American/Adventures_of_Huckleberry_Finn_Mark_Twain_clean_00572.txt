Somebody says : `` Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I 'm obleeged to say . '' 
Then the others softened up a little , too , and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn ; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him . 
Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward . 
So every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they would n't cuss him no more . 
Then they come out and locked him up . 
I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off , because they was rotten heavy , or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ; but they did n't think of it , and I reckoned it war n't best for me to mix in , but I judged I 'd get the doctor 's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I 'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me -- explanations , I mean , of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger . 
But I had plenty time . 
Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night , and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him . 
Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better , and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap . 
So I slips to the sick-room , and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash .
