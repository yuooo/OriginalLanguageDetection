The door opened suddenly . 
Both gentlemen started violently , looked round , and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat . 
`` Tap ? '' 
asked the face , and stood staring . 
`` No , '' said both gentlemen at once . 
`` Over the other side , my man , '' said Mr. Bunting . 
And `` Please shut that door , '' said Mr. Cuss , irritably . 
`` All right , '' said the intruder , as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry . 
`` Right you are , '' said the intruder in the former voice . 
`` Stand clear ! ''
