Holding a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room . 
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag 's mouth . 
This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens ; what a sight ! 
Such a face ! 
It was of a dark , purplish , yellow color , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares . 
Yes , it 's just as I thought , he 's a terrible bedfellow ; he 's been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon . 
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks . 
They were stains of some sort or other . 
At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me . 
I remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
