Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward . 
Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim , but it would n't go well with the story of us being so poor . 
Too much like jewelry . 
Ropes are the correct thing -- we must preserve the unities , as we say on the boards . '' 
We all said the duke was pretty smart , and there could n't be no trouble about running daytimes . 
We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke 's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to . 
We laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and did n't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it . 
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : `` Huck , does you reck 'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo ' kings on dis trip ? '' 
`` No , '' I says , `` I reckon not . '' 
`` Well , '' says he , `` dat 's all right , den .
