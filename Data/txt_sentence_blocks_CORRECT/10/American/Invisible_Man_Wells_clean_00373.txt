At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs , and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview . 
But as he passed the staircase window , he heard the side gate slam . 
Emerging into the hill-road , Kemp naturally took the downward direction , and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago . 
He ran it well , for a man out of training , and though his face was white and wet , his wits were cool to the last . 
He ran with wide strides , and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened , wherever there came a patch of raw flints , or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling , he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would . 
For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was indescribably vast and desolate , and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote . 
Never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression that running . 
All the gaunt villas , sleeping in the afternoon sun , looked locked and barred ; no doubt they were locked and barred -- by his own orders . 
But at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this ! 
The town was rising up now , the sea had dropped out of sight behind it , and people down below were stirring .
