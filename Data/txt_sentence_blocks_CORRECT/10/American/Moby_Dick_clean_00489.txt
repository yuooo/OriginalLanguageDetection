Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect . 
I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast , which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- I should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular . 
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for I have most remarked them in the large , full-grown bulls of the species . 
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale . 
It has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket-pieces . 
Like most sea-terms , this one is very happy and significant . 
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity . 
It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides . 
What would become of a Greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the North , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ? 
True , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold-blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood .
