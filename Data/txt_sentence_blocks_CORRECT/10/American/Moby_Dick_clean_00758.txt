will ye never have done with all this weary roving ? 
Where go ye now ? 
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ? 
Seek out one Pip , who 's now been missing long : I think he 's in those far Antilles . 
If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look ! 
he 's left his tambourine behind ; -- I found it . 
Rig-a-dig , dig , dig ! 
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I 'll beat ye your dying march . '' 
`` I have heard , '' murmured Starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , `` that in violent fevers , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient tongues ; and that when the mystery is probed , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars . 
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes .
