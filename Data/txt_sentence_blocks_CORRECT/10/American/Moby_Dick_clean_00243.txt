Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask 's official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinnertime , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab . 
Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod 's cabin . 
After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward . 
And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees . 
They made a sort of temporary servants ' hall of the high and mighty cabin . 
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain 's table , was the entire care-free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers . 
While their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it . 
They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices . 
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox . 
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon-wise .
