I says . 
`` Warnings to the people that something is up . 
Sometimes it 's done one way , sometimes another . 
But there 's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle . 
When Louis XVI . 
was going to light out of the Tooleries a servant-girl done it . 
It 's a very good way , and so is the nonnamous letters . 
We 'll use them both . 
And it 's usual for the prisoner 's mother to change clothes with him , and she stays in , and he slides out in her clothes . 
We 'll do that , too . ''
