For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary 's in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain . 
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout . 
It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it . 
You can not go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away . 
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapory shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it . 
And I know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , I can not say , the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm . 
Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it . 
Another thing ; I have heard it said , and I do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you . 
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone . 
Still , we can hypothesize , even if we can not prove and establish .
