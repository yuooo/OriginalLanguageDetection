Hark ! '' 
`` Mast-head , there ! 
Look sharp , all of ye ! 
There are whales hereabouts ! 
If ye see a white one , split your lungs for him ! 
`` What do you think of that now , Flask ? 
ai n't there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ? 
A white whale -- did ye mark that , man ? 
Look ye -- there 's something special in the wind . 
Stand by for it , Flask .
