Hall , Henfrey , and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell into the street . 
They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road , and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder . 
Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them . 
Mr. Huxter was stunned . 
Henfrey stopped to discover this , but Hall and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner , shouting incoherent things , and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall . 
They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the Invisible Man suddenly become visible , and set off at once along the lane in pursuit . 
But Hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways , clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground . 
He had been charged just as one charges a man at football . 
The second labourer came round in a circle , stared , and conceiving that Hall had tumbled over of his own accord , turned to resume the pursuit , only to be tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been . 
Then , as the first labourer struggled to his feet , he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox .
