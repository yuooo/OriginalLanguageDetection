Thus ends BOOK I. -LRB- Folio -RRB- , and now begins BOOK II . 
-LRB- Octavo -RRB- . 
OCTAVOES . 
* These embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which at present may be numbered : -- I. , the Grampus ; II. , the Black Fish ; III. , the Narwhale ; IV. , the Thrasher ; V. , the Killer . 
* Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain . 
Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder 's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does . 
by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets . 
The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale , the Horned whale , and the Unicorn whale . 
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature . 
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn 's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices .
