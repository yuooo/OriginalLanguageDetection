`` Why was n't my breakfast laid ? 
Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? 
Do you think I live without eating ? '' 
`` Why is n't my bill paid ? '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` That 's what I want to know . '' 
`` I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance -- '' `` I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . 
You ca n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? '' 
The stranger swore briefly but vividly .
