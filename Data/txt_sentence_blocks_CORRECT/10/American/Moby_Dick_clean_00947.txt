Diving beneath the settling ship , the whale ran quivering along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of Ahab 's boat , where , for a time , he lay quiescent . 
`` I turn my body from the sun . 
What ho , Tashtego ! 
Let me hear thy hammer . 
Oh ! 
ye three unsurrendered spires of mine ; thou uncracked keel ; and only god-bullied hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and Pole-pointed prow , -- death -- glorious ship ! 
must ye then perish , and without me ? 
Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains ? 
Oh , lonely death on lonely life ! 
Oh , now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief .
