MR. THOMAS MARVEL You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious , flexible visage , a nose of cylindrical protrusion , a liquorish , ample , fluctuating mouth , and a beard of bristling eccentricity . 
His figure inclined to embonpoint ; his short limbs accentuated this inclination . 
He wore a furry silk hat , and the frequent substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons , apparent at critical points of his costume , marked a man essentially bachelor . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards Adderdean , about a mile and a half out of Iping . 
His feet , save for socks of irregular open-work , were bare , his big toes were broad , and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog . 
In a leisurely manner -- he did everything in a leisurely manner -- he was contemplating trying on a pair of boots . 
They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time , but too large for him ; whereas the ones he had were , in dry weather , a very comfortable fit , but too thin-soled for damp . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes , but then he hated damp . 
He had never properly thought out which he hated most , and it was a pleasant day , and there was nothing better to do . 
So he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them .
