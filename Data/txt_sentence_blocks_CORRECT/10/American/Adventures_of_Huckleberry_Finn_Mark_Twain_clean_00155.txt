You start at the raft , and -- '' `` Oh , my lordy , lordy ! 
RAF ' ? 
Dey ain ' no raf ' no mo ' ; she done broke loose en gone I -- en here we is ! '' 
WELL , I catched my breath and most fainted . 
Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that ! 
But it war n't no time to be sentimentering . 
We 'd GOT to find that boat now -- had to have it for ourselves . 
So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , too -- seemed a week before we got to the stern . 
No sign of a boat . 
Jim said he did n't believe he could go any further -- so scared he had n't hardly any strength left , he said .
