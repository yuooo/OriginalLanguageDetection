If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you can not be said to be comfortable any more . 
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm . 
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich . 
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blankets between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air . 
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal . 
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed . 
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if , darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part . 
Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion . 
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk . 
Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once love comes to bend them .
