But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots . 
And if you 'll believe me , I 've raised nothing in the whole blessed country , try as I would , but them .

But it 's just my promiscuous luck . 
I 've got my boots in this country ten years or more . 
And then they treat you like this . '' 
`` It 's a beast of a country , '' said the Voice . 
`` And pigs for people . '' 
`` Ai n't it ? ''
