But all remained still as before . 
I began to grow alarmed . 
I had allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit . 
I looked through the key-hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one . 
I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more . 
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg 's harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber . 
That 's strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake . 
`` Queequeg ! 
-- Queequeg ! '' 
-- all still .
