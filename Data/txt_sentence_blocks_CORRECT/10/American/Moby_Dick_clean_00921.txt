I 'd crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there . 
And yet , 't is a noble and heroic thing , the wind ! 
who ever conquered it ? 
In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow . 
Run tilting at it , and you but run through it . 
Ha ! 
a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow . 
Even Ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than that . 
Would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man , all these things are bodiless , but only bodiless as objects , not as agents . 
There 's a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference !
