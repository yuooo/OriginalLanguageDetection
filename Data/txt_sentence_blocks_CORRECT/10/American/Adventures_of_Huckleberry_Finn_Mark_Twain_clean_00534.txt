Prisoners ai n't ever without rats . 
There ai n't no instance of it . 
And they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies . 
But you got to play music to them . 
You got anything to play music on ? '' 
`` I ain ' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o ' paper , en a juice-harp ; but I reck 'n dey wouldn ' take no stock in a juice-harp . '' 
`` Yes they would . 
THEY do n't care what kind of music 't is . 
A jews-harp 's plenty good enough for a rat . 
All animals like music -- in a prison they dote on it .
