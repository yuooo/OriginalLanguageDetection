Aye , I widowed that poor girl when I married her , Starbuck ; and then , the madness , the frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously , foamingly chased his prey -- more a demon than a man ! 
-- aye , aye ! 
what a forty years ' fool -- fool -- old fool , has old Ahab been ! 
Why this strife of the chase ? 
why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ? 
how the richer or better is Ahab now ? 
Behold . 
Oh , Starbuck ! 
is it not hard , that with this weary load I bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ? 
Here , brush this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that I seem to weep .
