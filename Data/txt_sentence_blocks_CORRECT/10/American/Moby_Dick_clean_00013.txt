But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; do n't you hear ? 
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way . 
So on I went . 
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns . 
Such dreary streets ! 
Blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb . 
At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted . 
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open . 
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch . 
Ha !
