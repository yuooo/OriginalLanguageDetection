His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines . 
It was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers . 
There war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white , a fish-belly white . 
As for his clothes -- just rags , that was all . 
He had one ankle resting on t ` other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then . 
His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid . 
I stood a-looking at him ; he set there a-looking at me , with his chair tilted back a little . 
I set the candle down . 
I noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed . 
He kept a-looking me all over .
