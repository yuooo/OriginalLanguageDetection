Let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent . 
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface . 
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being 's , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere . 
Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world . 
But he can not in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale 's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth . 
No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head . 
If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , I do not think I shall err ; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words . 
Assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time . 
That is to say , he would then live without breathing . 
Anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more -LRB- when at the bottom -RRB- without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .
