Soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled . 
Immediately , by Starbuck 's orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords . 
By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom . 
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described . 
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to . 
But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it . 
Who had darted that stone lance ? 
And when ? 
It might have been darted by some Nor ' West Indian long before America was discovered . 
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling .
