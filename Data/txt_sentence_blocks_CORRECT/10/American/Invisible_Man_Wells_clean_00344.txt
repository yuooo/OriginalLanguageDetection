Something rapped smartly against the brickwork over the frame , and made him start violently back . 
`` I 'm getting nervous , '' said Kemp . 
But it was five minutes before he went to the window again . 
`` It must have been a sparrow , '' he said .

He unbolted and unlocked the door , examined the chain , put it up , and opened cautiously without showing himself . 
A familiar voice hailed him . 
It was Adye .
