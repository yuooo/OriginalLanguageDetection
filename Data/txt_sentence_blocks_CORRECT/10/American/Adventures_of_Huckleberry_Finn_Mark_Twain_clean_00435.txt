Why , it was astonishing , the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone . 
So I got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : Miss Watson , your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville , and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send . 
HUCK FINN . 
I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life , and I knowed I could pray now . 
But I did n't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near I come to being lost and going to hell . 
And went on thinking . 
And got to thinking over our trip down the river ; and I see Jim before me all the time : in the day and in the night-time , sometimes moonlight , sometimes storms , and we a - floating along , talking and singing and laughing . 
But somehow I could n't seem to strike no places to harden me against him , but only the other kind . 
I 'd see him standing my watch on top of his ` n , ` stead of calling me , so I could go on sleeping ; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog ; and when I come to him again in the swamp , up there where the feud was ; and such-like times ; and would always call me honey , and pet me and do everything he could think of for me , and how good he always was ; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard , and he was so grateful , and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world , and the ONLY one he 's got now ; and then I happened to look around and see that paper . 
It was a close place .
