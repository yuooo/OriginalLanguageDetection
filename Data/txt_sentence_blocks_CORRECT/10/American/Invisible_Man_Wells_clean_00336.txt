He stopped this quiet man , going quietly home to his midday meal , attacked him , beat down his feeble defences , broke his arm , felled him , and smashed his head to a jelly . 
Of course , he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his victim -- he must have been carrying it ready in his hand . 
Only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter . 
One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr. Wicksteed 's direct path home , but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way . 
The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect that , going to her afternoon school , she saw the murdered man `` trotting '' in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit . 
Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his walking-stick . 
She was the last person to see him alive . 
He passed out of her sight to his death , the struggle being hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground . 
Now this , to the present writer 's mind at least , lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton . 
We may imagine that Griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed , but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder .
