-- Mr. Stubb , Mr. Flask , come forward with me . '' 
`` He goes off in a huff . 
The whole he can endure ; at the parts he baulks . 
Now I do n't like this . 
I make a leg for Captain Ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg , and he wo n't put his head into it . 
Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ? 
And now I 'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it . 
It 's like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now . 
I do n't like this cobbling sort of business -- I do n't like it at all ; it 's undignified ; it 's not my place . 
Let tinkers ' brats do tinkerings ; we are their betters .
