He only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself -- `` It 's a mutual , joint-stock world , in all meridians . 
We cannibals must help these Christians . '' 
Nantucket Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in Nantucket . 
Nantucket ! 
Take out your map and look at it . 
See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse . 
Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background . 
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper . 
Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they do n't grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day 's walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like Laplander snow-shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles . 
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois .
