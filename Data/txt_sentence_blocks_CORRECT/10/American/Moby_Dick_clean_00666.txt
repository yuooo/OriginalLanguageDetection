But that night , in particular , a strange -LRB- and ever since inexplicable -RRB- thing occurred to me . 
Starting from a brief standing sleep , I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong . 
The jaw-bone tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; I thought my eyes were open ; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart . 
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it . 
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness . 
Uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern . 
A stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me . 
Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted . 
My God ! 
what is the matter with me ?
