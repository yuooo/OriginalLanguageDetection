He got up slowly , leaving his lunch unfinished -- the letter had come by the one o'clock post -- and went into his study . 
He rang for his housekeeper , and told her to go round the house at once , examine all the fastenings of the windows , and close all the shutters . 
He closed the shutters of his study himself . 
From a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver , examined it carefully , and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket . 
He wrote a number of brief notes , one to Colonel Adye , gave them to his servant to take , with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house . 
`` There is no danger , '' he said , and added a mental reservation , `` to you . '' 
He remained meditative for a space after doing this , and then returned to his cooling lunch . 
He ate with gaps of thought . 
Finally he struck the table sharply . 
`` We will have him ! ''
