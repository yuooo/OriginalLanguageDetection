`` Now , '' says Ben Rogers , `` what 's the line of business of this Gang ? '' 
`` Nothing only robbery and murder , '' Tom said . 
`` But who are we going to rob ? 
-- houses , or cattle , or -- '' `` Stuff ! 
stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , '' says Tom Sawyer . 
`` We ai n't burglars . 
That ai n't no sort of style . 
We are highwaymen . 
We stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money . '' 
`` Must we always kill the people ? ''
