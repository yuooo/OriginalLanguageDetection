Now , for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime , and that must be because they use them mercifully , as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses . 
But Ahab ; oh he 's a hard driver . 
Look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord . 
Halloa , there , you Smut ! 
bear a hand there with those screws , and let 's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs , true or false , as brewery men go round collecting old beer barrels , to fill 'em up again . 
What a leg this is ! 
It looks like a real live leg , filed down to nothing but the core ; he 'll be standing on this to-morrow ; he 'll be taking altitudes on it . 
Halloa ! 
I almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude . 
So , so ; chisel , file , and sand-paper , now !
