Instantly the house was full of screams and directions , and scurrying feet . 
He ran himself to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda ; as he did so Kemp 's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence . 
In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the asparagus , and was running across the tennis lawn to the house . 
`` You ca n't come in , '' said Mr. Heelas , shutting the bolts . 
`` I 'm very sorry if he 's after you , but you ca n't come in ! '' 
Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass , rapping and then shaking frantically at the French window . 
Then , seeing his efforts were useless , he ran along the veranda , vaulted the end , and went to hammer at the side door . 
Then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house , and so into the hill-road . 
And Mr. Heelas staring from his window -- a face of horror -- had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish , ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen .
