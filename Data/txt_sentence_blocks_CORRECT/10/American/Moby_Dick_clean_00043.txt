-- but turn flukes again and go to sleep . 
Queequeg , look here -- you sabbee me , I sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee ? '' 
`` Me sabbee plenty '' -- grunted Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed . 
`` You gettee in , '' he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side . 
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way . 
I stood looking at him a moment . 
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal . 
What 's all this fuss I have been making about , thought I to myself -- the man 's a human being just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as I have to be afraid of him . 
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian . 
`` Landlord , '' said I , `` tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and I will turn in with him .
