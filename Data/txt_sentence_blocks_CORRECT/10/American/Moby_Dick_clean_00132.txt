Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab 's above the common ; Ahab 's been in colleges , as well as ` mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales . 
His lance ! 
aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle ! 
Oh ! 
he ai n't Captain Bildad ; no , and he ai n't Captain Peleg ; he 's Ahab , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king ! '' 
`` And a very vile one . 
When that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not lick his blood ? '' 
`` Come hither to me -- hither , hither , '' said Peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me . 
`` Look ye , lad ; never say that on board the Pequod . 
Never say it anywhere .
