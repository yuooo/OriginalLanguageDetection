He says , very low : `` Tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; that 's the dead ; tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; they 're coming after me ; but I wo n't go . 
Oh , they 're here ! 
do n't touch me -- do n't ! 
hands off -- they 're cold ; let go . 
Oh , let a poor devil alone ! '' 
Then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still a-begging ; and then he went to crying . 
I could hear him through the blanket . 
By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me . 
He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife , calling me the Angel of Death , and saying he would kill me , and then I could n't come for him no more . 
I begged , and told him I was only Huck ; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up .
