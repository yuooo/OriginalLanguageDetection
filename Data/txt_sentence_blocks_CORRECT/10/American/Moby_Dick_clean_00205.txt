Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . 
For , as when the red-cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such gladhearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air . 
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile . 
Enter Ahab ; to Him , Stubb Some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring , which at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic . 
The warmly cool , clear , ringing perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet , heaped up -- flaked up , with rose-water snow . 
The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns ! 
For sleeping man , 't was hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights . 
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world . 
Inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights . 
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab 's texture .
