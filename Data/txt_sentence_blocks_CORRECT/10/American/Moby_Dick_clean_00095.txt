It was in Sag Harbor . 
The owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house . 
Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf . 
`` Why , '' said I , `` Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think . 
Did n't the people laugh ? '' 
Upon this , he told me another story . 
The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held . 
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg 's sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten . 
Well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride 's bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honor , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg 's father . 
Grace being said , -- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates .
