Closing the door upon the landlady , I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain . 
There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in any the slightest way . 
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island . 
It must be so ; yes , it 's a part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he 'll get up sooner or later , no doubt . 
It ca n't last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I do n't believe it 's very punctual then . 
I went down to supper . 
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage , as they called it -LRB- that is , a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only -RRB- ; after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination . 
But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch . 
I began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head . 
`` For heaven 's sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper .
