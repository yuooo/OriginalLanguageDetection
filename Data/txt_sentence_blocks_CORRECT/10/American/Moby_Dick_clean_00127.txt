Bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , `` Captain Peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship -- widows and orphans , many of them -- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans . 
The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay , Captain Peleg . '' 
`` Thou Bildad ! '' 
roared Peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin . 
`` Blast ye , Captain Bildad , if I had followed thy advice in these matters , I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn . '' 
`` Captain Peleg , '' said Bildad steadily , `` thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I ca n't tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg . '' 
`` Fiery pit ! 
fiery pit ! 
ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me . 
It 's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he 's bound to hell .
