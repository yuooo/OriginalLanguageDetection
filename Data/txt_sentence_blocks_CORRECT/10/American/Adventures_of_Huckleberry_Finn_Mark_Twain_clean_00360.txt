Says I to myself , and this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money ! 
Then Mary Jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely again -- which was her way ; but when she got done there war n't hardly anything left o ' poor Hare-lip . 
So she hollered . 
`` All right , then , '' says the other girls ; `` you just ask his pardon . '' 
She done it , too ; and she done it beautiful . 
She done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again . 
I says to myself , this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money . 
And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends . 
I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself , my mind 's made up ; I 'll hive that money for them or bust . 
So then I lit out -- for bed , I said , meaning some time or another .
