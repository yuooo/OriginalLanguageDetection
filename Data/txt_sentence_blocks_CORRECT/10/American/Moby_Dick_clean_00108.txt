Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots , which well deserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling chowders . 
Chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes . 
The area before the house was paved with clam-shells . 
Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin . 
There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen 's boats , I saw Hosea 's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod 's decapitated head , looking very slipshod , I assure ye . 
Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers . 
`` Why not ? 
said I ; `` every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not ? '' 
`` Because it 's dangerous , '' says she . 
`` Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort ` nt v ` y' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ile , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night .
