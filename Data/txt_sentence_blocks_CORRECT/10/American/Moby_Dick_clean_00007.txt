I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them . 
For my part , I abominate all honorable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever . 
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not . 
And as for going as cook , -- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ; -- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will . 
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids . 
No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the fore-castle , aloft there to the royal mast-head . 
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a May meadow . 
And at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough . 
It touches one 's sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the Van Rensselaers , or Randolphs , or Hardicanutes . 
And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you .
