And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things . 
The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England , and blest if I did n't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes . 
She says : `` Did you ever see the king ? '' 
`` Who ? 
William Fourth ? 
Well , I bet I have -- he goes to our church . '' 
I knowed he was dead years ago , but I never let on . 
So when I says he goes to our church , she says : `` What -- regular ? '' 
`` Yes -- regular . 
His pew 's right over opposite ourn -- on t ` other side the pulpit . ''
