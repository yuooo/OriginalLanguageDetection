I went on a-whimpering , and says : `` I do n't want to blow on nobody ; and I ai n't got no time to blow , nohow . 
I got to turn out and find my nigger . '' 
He looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead . 
At last he says : `` I 'll tell you something . 
We got to be here three days . 
If you 'll promise you wo n't blow , and wo n't let the nigger blow , I 'll tell you where to find him . '' 
So I promised , and he says : `` A farmer by the name of Silas Ph -- '' and then he stopped . 
You see , he started to tell me the truth ; but when he stopped that way , and begun to study and think again , I reckoned he was changing his mind . 
And so he was . 
He would n't trust me ; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days .
