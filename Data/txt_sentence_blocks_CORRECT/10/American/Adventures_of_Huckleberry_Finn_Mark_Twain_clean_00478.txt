When we got home the house was all dark and still ; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it . 
We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do . 
They knowed us , and did n't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night . 
When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ; and on the side I war n't acquainted with -- which was the north side -- we found a square window-hole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it . 
I says : `` Here 's the ticket . 
This hole 's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board . '' 
Tom says : `` It 's as simple as tit-tat-toe , three-in-a-row , and as easy as playing hooky . 
I should HOPE we can find a way that 's a little more complicated than THAT , Huck Finn . '' 
`` Well , then , '' I says , `` how 'll it do to saw him out , the way I done before I was murdered that time ? ''
