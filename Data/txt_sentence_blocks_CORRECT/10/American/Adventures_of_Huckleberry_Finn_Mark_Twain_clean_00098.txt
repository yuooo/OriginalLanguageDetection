I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn ' fool wid raffs no mo ' , long as dey move de lantern roun ' so . 
I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg , en some matches in my cap , en dey war n't wet , so I ` uz all right . '' 
`` And so you ai n't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ? 
Why did n't you get mud-turkles ? '' 
`` How you gwyne to git 'm ? 
You ca n't slip up on um en grab um ; en how 's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ? 
How could a body do it in de night ? 
En I war n't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime . '' 
`` Well , that 's so . 
You 've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course .
