Oh , cruel ! 
what hast thou done with her ? 
There lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater . 
Thou knowest not how came ye , hence callest thyself unbegotten ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence callest thyself unbegun . 
I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent . 
There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy eternity is but time , all thy creativeness mechanical . 
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it . 
Oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief . 
Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire . 
Leap !
