That made me feel easy and satisfied . 
Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and I told Jim everything . 
WE das n't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river . 
We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home . 
We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards . 
It was the first I ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal . 
So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again . 
First they done a lecture on temperance ; but they did n't make enough for them both to get drunk on . 
Then in another village they started a dancing-school ; but they did n't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town . 
Another time they tried to go at yellocution ; but they did n't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing , and made them skip out .
