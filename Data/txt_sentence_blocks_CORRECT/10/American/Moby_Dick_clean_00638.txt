But come aboard , and mayhap he 'll believe you , if he wo n't me ; and so I 'll get out of this dirty scrape . '' 
`` Anything to oblige ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow , '' rejoined Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck . 
There a queer scene presented itself . 
The sailors , in tasselled caps of red worsted , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales . 
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor . 
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms . 
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air . 
Some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal-tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils . 
Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories . 
Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain 's round-house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within .
