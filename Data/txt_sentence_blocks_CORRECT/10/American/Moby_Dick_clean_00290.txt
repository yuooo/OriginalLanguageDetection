ICELAND SAILOR I do n't like your floor , maty ; it 's too springy to my taste . 
I 'm used to ice-floors . 
I 'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject ; but excuse me . 
MALTESE SAILOR Me too ; where 's your girls ? 
Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right , and say to himself , how d'ye do ? 
Partners ! 
I must have partners ! 
SICILIAN SAILOR Aye ; girls and a green !
