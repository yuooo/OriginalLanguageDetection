And always is . 
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we 'd got to have it ; so he took a think . 
When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming , and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and I slid one of them up my sleeve , and Tom says : `` Why , Aunt Sally , there ai n't but nine spoons YET . '' 
She says : `` Go ` long to your play , and do n't bother me . 
I know better , I counted 'm myself . '' 
`` Well , I 've counted them twice , Aunty , and I ca n't make but nine . '' 
She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count -- anybody would . 
`` I declare to gracious ther ' AI N'T but nine ! '' 
she says . 
`` Why , what in the world -- plague TAKE the things , I 'll count 'm again . ''
