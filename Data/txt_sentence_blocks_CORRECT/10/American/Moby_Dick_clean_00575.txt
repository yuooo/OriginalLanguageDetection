even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink . 
Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species . 
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do . 
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free . 
But there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life . 
But the reason of this is obvious . 
Gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon . 
A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then . 
In the Shore Whaling , on soundings , among the Bays of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again . 
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod 's mast-heads , announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming .
