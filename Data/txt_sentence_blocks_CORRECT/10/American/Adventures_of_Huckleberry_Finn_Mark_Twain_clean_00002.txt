The Widow Douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when I could n't stand it no longer I lit out . 
I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied . 
But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable . 
So I went back . 
The widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it . 
She put me in them new clothes again , and I could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up . 
Well , then , the old thing commenced again . 
The widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time . 
When you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them , -- that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself . 
In a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better .
