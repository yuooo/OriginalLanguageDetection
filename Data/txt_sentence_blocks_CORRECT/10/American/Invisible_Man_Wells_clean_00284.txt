` This way , policeman ! ' 
I heard someone shouting . 
I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . 
I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . 
They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers . 
` He 's dropping his plunder , ' said one of the young men . 
` He must be somewhere here . ' 
`` But they did not find me all the same . 
`` I stood watching them hunt for me for a time , and cursing my ill-luck in losing the clothes . 
Then I went into the refreshment-room , drank a little milk I found there , and sat down by the fire to consider my position .
