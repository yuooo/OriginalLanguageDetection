`` I grow blind ; hands ! 
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way . 
Is ' t night ? '' 
`` The whale ! 
The ship ! '' 
cried the cringing oarsmen . 
`` Oars ! 
oars ! 
Slope downwards to thy depths , O sea that ere it be for ever too late , Ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark ! 
I see : the ship !
