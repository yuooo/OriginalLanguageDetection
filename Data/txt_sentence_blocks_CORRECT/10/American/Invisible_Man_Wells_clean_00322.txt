The key had been slipped in hastily that morning . 
As Kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet . 
Kemp 's face became white . 
He tried to grip the door handle with both hands . 
For a moment he stood lugging . 
Then the door gave six inches . 
But he got it closed again . 
The second time it was jerked a foot wide , and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening . 
His throat was gripped by invisible fingers , and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself . 
He was forced back , tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing .
