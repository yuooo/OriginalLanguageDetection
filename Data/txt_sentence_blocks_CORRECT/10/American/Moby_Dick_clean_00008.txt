The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it . 
But even this wears off in time . 
What of it , if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ? 
What does that indignity amount to , weighed , I mean , in the scales of the New Testament ? 
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ? 
Who ai n't a slave ? 
Tell me that . 
Well , then , however the old sea-captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other 's shoulder-blades , and be content . 
Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of . 
On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .
