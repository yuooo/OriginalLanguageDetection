With not one tenth of England 's experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . 
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . 
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals . 
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager -LRB- I honor him for a veteran -RRB- , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace . 
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself `` H. Durand . '' 
One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . 
It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . 
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . 
The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove-to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel -LRB- in the act of cutting-in -RRB- hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . 
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half-erect out of the water , like a rearing horse .
