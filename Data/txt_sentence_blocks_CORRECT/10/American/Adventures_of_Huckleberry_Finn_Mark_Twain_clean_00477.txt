It was outrageous , and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so ; and so be his true friend , and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself . 
And I DID start to tell him ; but he shut me up , and says : `` Do n't you reckon I know what I 'm about ? 
Do n't I generly know what I 'm about ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Did n't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` WELL , then . '' 
That 's all he said , and that 's all I said . 
It war n't no use to say any more ; because when he said he 'd do a thing , he always done it . 
But I could n't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ; so I just let it go , and never bothered no more about it .
