Captain Ahab did not name himself . 
'T was a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old . 
And yet the old squaw Tistig , at Gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic . 
And , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same . 
I wish to warn thee . 
It 's a lie . 
I know Captain Ahab well ; I 've sailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is -- a good man -- not a pious , good man , like Bildad , but a swearing good man -- something like me -- only there 's a good deal more of him . 
Aye , aye , I know that he was never very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about , as any one might see . 
I know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he 's been a kind of moody -- desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off . 
And once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it 's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one .
