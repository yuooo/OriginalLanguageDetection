`` Fools then or fools now , '' said Kemp . 
`` As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man ! 
`` But I went to work -- like a slave . 
And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly -- blindingly ! 
I found a general principle of pigments and refraction -- a formula , a geometrical expression involving four dimensions . 
Fools , common men , even common mathematicians , do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics . 
In the books -- the books that tramp has hidden -- there are marvels , miracles ! 
But this was not a method , it was an idea , that might lead to a method by which it would be possible , without changing any other property of matter -- except , in some instances colours -- to lower the refractive index of a substance , solid or liquid , to that of air -- so far as all practical purposes are concerned . '' 
`` Phew ! '' 
said Kemp .
