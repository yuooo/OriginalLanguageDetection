Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play . 
And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault . 
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish . 
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going `` head out '' ; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed . 
* * It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale 's enormous head consists . 
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him . 
So that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed . 
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat . 
`` Start her , start her , my men ! 
Do n't hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder-claps , that 's all , '' cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke .
