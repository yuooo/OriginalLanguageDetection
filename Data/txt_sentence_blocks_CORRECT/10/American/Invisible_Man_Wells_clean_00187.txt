Apparently some subconscious element was at work . 
At any rate , he turned with his burden , went back to the hall , put down the syphon and whiskey , and bending down , touched the spot . 
Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood . 
He took up his burden again , and returned upstairs , looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot . 
On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished . 
The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained . 
He looked at his own hand . 
It was quite clean , and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study , and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all . 
He went straight into his room , his face quite calm -- perhaps a trifle more resolute than usual . 
His glance , wandering inquisitively , fell on the bed .
