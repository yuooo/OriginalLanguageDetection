The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots , whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket , and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea , as he called him , was famous for his chowders . 
In short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots . 
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was ; these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard . 
However , by dint of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way , we at last came to something which there was no mistaking . 
Two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses ' ears , swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast , planted in front of an old doorway . 
The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side , so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows . 
Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time , but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving . 
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , two of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me . 
It 's ominous , thinks I . 
A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen 's chapel , and here a gallows !
