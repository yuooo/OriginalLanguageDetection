So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue-veined neck , the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases . 
Then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil-blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell . 
But let us to the story . 
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb 's after-oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place . 
The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful . 
Now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip 's seat . 
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water . 
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto ! 
poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck . 
Tashtego stood in the bows .
