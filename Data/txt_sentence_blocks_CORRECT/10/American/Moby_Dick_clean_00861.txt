Ding , dong , ding ! 
Who 's seen Pip ? 
He must be up here ; let 's try the door . 
What ? 
neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there 's no opening it . 
It must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : Aye , and told me this screwed chair was mine . 
Here , then , I 'll seat me , against the transom , in the ship 's full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me . 
Here , our old sailors say , in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants . 
Ha ! 
what 's this ?
