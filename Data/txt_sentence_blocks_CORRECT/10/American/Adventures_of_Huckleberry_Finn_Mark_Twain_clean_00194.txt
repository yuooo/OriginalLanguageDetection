I said likely we would n't , because I had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ? 
Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show . 
But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again . 
That disturbed Jim -- and me too . 
So the question was , what to do ? 
I said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a trading-scow , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo . 
Jim thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited . 
There war n't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it . 
He said he 'd be mighty sure to see it , because he 'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he 'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom . 
Every little while he jumps up and says : `` Dah she is ? ''
