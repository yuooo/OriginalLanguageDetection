`` He 'll clear out , '' said Adye . 
`` Not he , '' said Kemp . 
A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs . 
Adye had a silvery glimpse of a little revolver half out of Kemp 's pocket . 
`` It 's a window , upstairs ! '' 
said Kemp , and led the way up . 
There came a second smash while they were still on the staircase . 
When they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed , half the room littered with splintered glass , and one big flint lying on the writing table . 
The two men stopped in the doorway , contemplating the wreckage . 
Kemp swore again , and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol , hung starred for a moment , and collapsed in jagged , shivering triangles into the room .
