Of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though I could hear her . 
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I did n't get any answer ; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was `` treading water , '' and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me . 
But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing ; so I changed off and went that way . 
It was one of these long , slanting , two-mile crossings ; so I was a good long time in getting over . 
I made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank . 
I could n't see but a little ways , but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then I run across a big old - fashioned double log-house before I noticed it . 
I was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and I knowed better than to move another peg . 
IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : `` Be done , boys ! 
Who 's there ? '' 
I says : `` It 's me . ''
