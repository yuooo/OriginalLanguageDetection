That was all right as far as it went , but the towhead war n't sixty yards long , and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog , and had n't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man . 
Thinks I , it wo n't do to paddle ; first I know I 'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; I got to set still and float , and yet it 's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time . 
I whooped and listened . 
Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits . 
I went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again . 
The next time it come I see I war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it . 
And the next time I was heading away to the left of it -- and not gaining on it much either , for I was flying around , this way and that and t ` other , but it was going straight ahead all the time . 
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me . 
Well , I fought along , and directly I hears the whoop BEHIND me . 
I was tangled good now .
