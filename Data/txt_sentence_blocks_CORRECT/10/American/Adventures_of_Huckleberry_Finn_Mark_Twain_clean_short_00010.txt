Then it begun to itch on the inside . 
Next I got to itching underneath . 
I did n't know how I was going to set still . 
This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that . 
I was itching in eleven different places now . 
I reckoned I could n't stand it more 'n a minute longer , but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try . 
Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again . 
Tom he made a sign to me -- kind of a little noise with his mouth -- and we went creeping away on our hands and knees . 
When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me , and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun . 
But I said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they 'd find out I war n't in .
