But I did n't . 
As I sprung aboard I sung out : `` Out with you , Jim , and set her loose ! 
Glory be to goodness , we 're shut of them ! '' 
Jim lit out , and was a-coming for me with both arms spread , he was so full of joy ; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards ; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one , and it most scared the livers and lights out of me . 
But Jim fished me out , and was going to hug me and bless me , and so on , he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke , but I says : `` Not now ; have it for breakfast , have it for breakfast ! 
Cut loose and let her slide ! '' 
So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river , and it DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us . 
I had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few times -- I could n't help it ; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited ; and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come ! 
-- and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum ! 
It was the king and the duke .
