By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , I saw ? 
-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out . 
Says I on second thought , ' I guess I wo n't kick you , old fellow . ' 
` Wise Stubb , ' said he , ` wise Stubb ; ' and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag . 
Seeing he was n't going to stop saying over his ` wise Stubb , wise Stubb , ' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again . 
But I had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ` Stop that kicking ! ' 
` Halloa , ' says I , ` what 's the matter now , old fellow ? ' 
` Look ye here , ' says he ; ` let 's argue the insult . 
Captain Ahab kicked ye , did n't he ? ' 
` Yes , he did , ' says I -- ` right here it was . '
