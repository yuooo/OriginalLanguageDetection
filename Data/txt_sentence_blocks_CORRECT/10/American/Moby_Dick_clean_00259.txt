it was that accursed white whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day ! '' 
Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : `` Aye , aye ! 
and I 'll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition 's flames before I give him up . 
And this is what ye have shipped for , men ! 
to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out . 
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ? 
I think ye do look brave . '' 
`` Aye , aye ! '' 
shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : `` A sharp eye for the White Whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick ! '' 
`` God bless ye , '' he seemed to half sob and half shout .
