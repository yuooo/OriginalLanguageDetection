Do n't be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour 's mout , I say . 
Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale ? 
And , by Gor , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else . 
I know some o ' you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swallar wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat ca n't get into de scrouge to help demselves . '' 
`` Well done , old Fleece ! '' 
cried Stubb , `` that 's Christianity ; go on . '' 
`` No use goin ' on ; de dam willains will keep a scrougin ' and slappin ' each oder , Massa Stubb ; dey do n't hear one word ; no use a-preaching to such dam g ` uttons as you call 'em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get 'em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in de sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and ca n't hear noting at all , no more , for eber and eber . '' 
`` Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , Fleece , and I 'll away to my supper . '' 
Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried -- `` Cussed fellow-critters ! 
Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust -- and den die . ''
