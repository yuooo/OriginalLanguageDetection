And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire . 
She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there had n't ever been no snakes created . 
Why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally war n't over it yet ; she war n't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings . 
It was very curious . 
But Tom said all women was just so . 
He said they was made that way for some reason or other . 
We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings war n't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them . 
I did n't mind the lickings , because they did n't amount to nothing ; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot . 
But we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim 's was when they 'd all swarm out for music and go for him . 
Jim did n't like the spiders , and the spiders did n't like Jim ; and so they 'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him .
