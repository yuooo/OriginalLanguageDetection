The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn - pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : `` You been down cellar ? ''
