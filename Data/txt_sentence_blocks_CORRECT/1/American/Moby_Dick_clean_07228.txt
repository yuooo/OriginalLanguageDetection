Here Saturn 's grey chaos rolls over me , and I obtain dim , shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities ; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics ; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world 's circumference , not an inhabitable hand 's breadth of land was visible .
