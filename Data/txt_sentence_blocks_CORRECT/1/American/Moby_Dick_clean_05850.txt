The Fountain That for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute -LRB- fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December , A.D. 1851 -RRB- , it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapor -- this is surely a noteworthy thing .
