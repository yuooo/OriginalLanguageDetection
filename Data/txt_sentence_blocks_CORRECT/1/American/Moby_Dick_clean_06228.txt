These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit , -- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it -LRB- the fish -RRB- acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .
