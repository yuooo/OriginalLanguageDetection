When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow 's - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him -LRB- also fixed in the rack -RRB- , together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing .
