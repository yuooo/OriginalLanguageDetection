I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair-and-square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler 's job , that 's at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end .
