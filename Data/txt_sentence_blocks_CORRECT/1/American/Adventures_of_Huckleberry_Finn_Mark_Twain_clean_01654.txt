Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river .
