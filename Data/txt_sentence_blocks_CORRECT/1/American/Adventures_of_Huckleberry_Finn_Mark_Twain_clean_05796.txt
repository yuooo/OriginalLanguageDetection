So Tom 's Aunt Polly , she told all about who I was , and what ; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- she chipped in and says , `` Oh , go on and call me Aunt Sally , I 'm used to it now , and ` tai n't no need to change '' -- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it -- there war n't no other way , and I knowed he would n't mind , because it would be nuts for him , being a mystery , and he 'd make an adventure out of it , and be perfectly satisfied .
