Jim said he would `` jis ' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ; '' and found so much fault with it , and with the work and bother of raising the mullen , and jews-harping the rats , and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things , on top of all the other work he had to do on pens , and inscriptions , and journals , and things , which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook , that Tom most lost all patience with him ; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself , and yet he did n't know enough to appreciate them , and they was just about wasted on him .
