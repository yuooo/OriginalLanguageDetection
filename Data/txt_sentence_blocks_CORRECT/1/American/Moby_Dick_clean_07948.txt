To sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have I heard a common oath when God 's burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His `` Mene , Mene , Tekel Upharsin '' has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage .
