The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other -LRB- excepting the side-fins -RRB- , its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it .
