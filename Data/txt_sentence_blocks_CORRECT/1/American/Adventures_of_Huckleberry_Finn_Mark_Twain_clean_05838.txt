Tom 's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ai n't nothing more to write about , and I am rotten glad of it , because if I 'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I would n't a tackled it , and ai n't a-going to no more .
