I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless , -- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .
