I had everything I needed , and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home -- better , maybe , because it was so quiet ; but there I WAS , with both of 'm on my hands , and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning ; then some men in a skiff come by , and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ; so I motioned them in quiet , and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about , and we never had no trouble .
