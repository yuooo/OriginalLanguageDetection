Tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel 's , and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing .
