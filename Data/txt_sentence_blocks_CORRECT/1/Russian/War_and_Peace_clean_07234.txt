Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement , but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years ; but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken .
