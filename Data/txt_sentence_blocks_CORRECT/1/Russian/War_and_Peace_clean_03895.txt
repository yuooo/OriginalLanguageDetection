Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men , like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns , an officer , in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men , squeezed his way along ; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river , an hussar on foot , an orderly , or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry ; and sometimes like a log floating down the river , an officers ' or company 's baggage wagon , piled high , leather covered , and hemmed in on all sides , moved across the bridge .
