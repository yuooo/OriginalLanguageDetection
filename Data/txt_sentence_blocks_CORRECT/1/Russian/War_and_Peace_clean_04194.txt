`` In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness ; but here ... groans , suffering , fear , and this uncertainty and hurry ... There -- they are shouting again , and again are all running back somewhere , and I shall run with them , and it , death , is here above me and around ... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun , this water , that gorge !
