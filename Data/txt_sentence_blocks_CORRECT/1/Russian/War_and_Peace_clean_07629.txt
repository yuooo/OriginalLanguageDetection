Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream , and having stumbled on him in the fog , hearing no encouraging word from their commanders , and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks , and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog , the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted , receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments .
