It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I , standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him ; a character exposed to those strongest of all influences : the intrigues , flattery , and self-deception inseparable from power ; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe ; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits , passions , and impulses toward goodness , beauty , and truth -- that this character -- though not lacking in virtue -LRB- the historians do not accuse him of that -RRB- -- had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning : that is , with books and lectures and with taking notes from them .
