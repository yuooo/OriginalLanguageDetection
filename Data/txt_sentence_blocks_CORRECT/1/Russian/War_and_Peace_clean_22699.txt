But Count Rostopchin , who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the government offices removed ; now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble ; now had processions displaying the icons , and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints ; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich ; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house ; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage ; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed ; now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him , and now reproached them for doing so ; now expelled all the French residents from Moscow , and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalme -LRB- the center of the whole French colony in Moscow -RRB- to remain , but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense ; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now , to get rid of them , handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate ; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow , and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in the affair -- this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people , to perform some patriotically heroic feat ; and like a child he made sport of the momentous , and unavoidable event -- the abandonment and burning of Moscow -- and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous , popular tide that bore him along with it .
