Soldiers and citizens , of whatever nation you may be , re-establish public confidence , the source of the welfare of a state , live like brothers , render mutual aid and protection one to another , unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded , obey the military and civil authorities , and your tears will soon cease to flow !
