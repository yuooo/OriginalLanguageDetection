At the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul : one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it ; the other , still more reasonably , says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger , since it is not in man 's power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events , and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes , and to think about what is pleasant .
