This black-eyed , wide-mouthed girl , not pretty but full of life - with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice , with black curls tossed backward , thin bare arms , little legs in lace-frilled drawers , and feet in low slippers -- was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child , though the child is not yet a young woman .
