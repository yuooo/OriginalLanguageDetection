Alexander I -- the pacifier of Europe , the man who from his early years had striven only for his people 's welfare , the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland -- now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples -- at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power -- Alexander I , having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of God upon him , suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power , turns away from it , and gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises , saying only : `` Not unto us , not unto us , but unto Thy Name !
