Some historians -- those biographical and specialist historians already referred to -- in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power , seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons , and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power , and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power -- mere violence .
