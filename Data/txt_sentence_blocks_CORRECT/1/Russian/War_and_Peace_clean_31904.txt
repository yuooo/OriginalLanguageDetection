If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time , that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time -LRB- in the first case the unknown quantity is the time , in the second case it is the origin -RRB- ; and the question of how man 's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject can not be solved by comparative physiology and zoology , for in a frog , a rabbit , or an ape , we can observe only the muscular nervous activity , but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity .
