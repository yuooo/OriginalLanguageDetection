Chichagov , one of the most zealous `` cutters-off '' and `` breakers-up , '' who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent : Chichagov , noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the Emperor , and who considered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutuzov , and found that peace had already been concluded , he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really Kutuzov 's ; this Chichagov was the first to meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay .
