Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us ; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us , may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind , and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight ; may they be ensnared when they know it not , and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them ; let them fall before Thy servants ' feet and be laid low by our hosts !
