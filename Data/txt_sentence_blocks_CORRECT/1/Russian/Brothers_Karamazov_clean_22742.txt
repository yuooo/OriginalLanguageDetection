The moments of contemplating that animal fear , when the criminal sees that all is lost , but still struggles , still means to struggle , the moments when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes , studies you , your face , your thoughts , uncertain on which side you will strike , and his distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant , but he is still afraid to speak , afraid of giving himself away !
