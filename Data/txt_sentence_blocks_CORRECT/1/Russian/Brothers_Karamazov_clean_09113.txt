Gentlemen , '' I cried suddenly , speaking straight from my heart , `` look around you at the gifts of God , the clear sky , the pure air , the tender grass , the birds ; nature is beautiful and sinless , and we , only we , are sinful and foolish , and we do n't understand that life is heaven , for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty , we shall embrace each other and weep .
