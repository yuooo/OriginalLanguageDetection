A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him ; or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby , who steals some food ; or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man -- seem less guilty , that is , less free and more subject to the law of necessity , to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed , and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning , that the mother was hungry , that the soldier was in the ranks , and so on .
