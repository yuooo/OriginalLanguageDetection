Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you , and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds , my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I can not overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted .
