you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man , you say you have ever seen , of your own D'Artagnan , of that man without an equal , as you formerly called him , and you come and tell him , with your arms folded , that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son , you who have seen all that can be seen in this world !
