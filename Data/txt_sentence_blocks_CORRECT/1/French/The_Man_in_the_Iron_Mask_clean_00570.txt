If you have sought me for my destruction ; if you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies ; if from our conference , in which you have sounded the depths of my mind , anything worse than captivity result , that is to say , if death befall me , still receive my blessing , for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long , weary years .
