To sum up , in conclusion , that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out , we will confine ourselves to the statement that , in the course of nineteen years , Jean Valjean , the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles , the formidable convict of Toulon , had become capable , thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him , of two sorts of evil action : firstly , of evil action which was rapid , unpremeditated , dashing , entirely instinctive , in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone ; secondly , of evil action which was serious , grave , consciously argued out and premeditated , with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish .
