La Fontaine perhaps ; magnificent egoists of the infinite , tranquil spectators of sorrow , who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair , for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile , who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light , who hear neither the cry nor the sob , nor the death rattle , nor the alarm peal , for whom everything is well , since there is a month of May , who , so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads , declare themselves content , and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted .
