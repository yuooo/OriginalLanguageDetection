He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy , who had been so proud a soldier , who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic , and had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon , who had beheld Genoa , Alexandria , Milan , Turin , Madrid , Vienna , Dresden , Berlin , Moscow , who had left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that same blood , which he , Marius , had in his veins , who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command , who had lived with his sword-belt buckled , his epaulets falling on his breast , his cockade blackened with powder , his brow furrowed with his helmet , in barracks , in camp , in the bivouac , in ambulances , and who , at the expiration of twenty years , had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek , a smiling countenance , tranquil , admirable , pure as a child , having done everything for France and nothing against her .
