You wish to make me believe in splendor , and we are lying lost in night ; you boast of glory , and we are smothering our words in the curtains of this miserable bed ; you give me glimpses of power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer in the corridor - that step which , after all , makes you tremble more than it does me .
