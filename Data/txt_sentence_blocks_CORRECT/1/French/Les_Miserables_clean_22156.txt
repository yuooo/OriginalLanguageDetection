The serene and lofty soul , inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions , dominating the clouds and the shades of this world , its follies , its lies , its hatreds , its vanities , its miseries , inhabits the blue of heaven , and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny , as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake .
