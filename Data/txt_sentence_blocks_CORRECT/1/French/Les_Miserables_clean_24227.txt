The lofty trees , the copses , the heaths , the branches rudely interlaced , the tall grass , exist in a sombre manner ; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible ; that which is below man distinguishes , through the mists , that which is beyond man ; and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night .
