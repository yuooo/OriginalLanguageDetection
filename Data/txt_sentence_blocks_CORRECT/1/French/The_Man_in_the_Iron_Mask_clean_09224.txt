The canoe was long , light , drawing little water , thin of keel ; in short , one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle ; a little high in its sides , solid upon the water , very manageable , furnished with planks which , in uncertain weather , formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide , so as to protect the rowers .
