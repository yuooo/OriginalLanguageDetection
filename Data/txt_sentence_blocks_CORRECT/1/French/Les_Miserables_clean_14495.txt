It is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne , and the mitre in the name of the attar ; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging , it is to kick over the traces ; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics ; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry ; it is to insult through excess of respect ; it is to discover that the Pope is not sufficiently papish , that the King is not sufficiently royal , and that the night has too much light ; it is to be discontented with alabaster , with snow , with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness ; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy ; it is to be so strongly for , as to be against .
