Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg , and when arrived , without suspecting that he was going to the place where La Valliere had lived , he heard so much music and respired so many perfumes , he heard so much joyous laughter , and saw so many dancing shadows , that if it had not been for a charitable woman , who perceived him so dejected and pale beneath a doorway , he would have remained there a few minutes , and then would have gone away , never to return .
