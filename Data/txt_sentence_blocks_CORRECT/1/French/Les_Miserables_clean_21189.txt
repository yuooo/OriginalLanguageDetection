This man , who had passed through all manner of distresses , who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate , who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint , who , after having dragged the chain of the galleys , was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery , this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium , this man accepted all , excused all , pardoned all , and merely asked of Providence , of man , of the law , of society , of nature , of the world , one thing , that Cosette might love him !
