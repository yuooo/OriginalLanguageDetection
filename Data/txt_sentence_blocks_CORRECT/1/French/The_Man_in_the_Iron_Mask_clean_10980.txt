Behind the chapel extended , surrounded by two high hedges of hazel , elder and white thorn , and a deep ditch , the little inclosure - uncultivated , though gay in its sterility ; because the mosses there grew thick , wild heliotrope and ravenelles there mingled perfumes , while from beneath an ancient chestnut issued a crystal spring , a prisoner in its marble cistern , and on the thyme all around alighted thousands of bees from the neighboring plants , whilst chaffinches and redthroats sang cheerfully among the flower-spangled hedges .
