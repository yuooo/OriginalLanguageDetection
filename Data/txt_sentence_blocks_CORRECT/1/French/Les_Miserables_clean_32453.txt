There has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys , there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe , there has been the sceptre of Charlemagne , which was of iron , there has been the sceptre of Louis the Great , which was of gold , -- the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger , ha ` penny straws ; it is done with , it is broken , it lies on the earth , there is no longer any sceptre , but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief , which smells of patchouli !
