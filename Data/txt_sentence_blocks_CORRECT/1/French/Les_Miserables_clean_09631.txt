Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration , mingled with despair ; then , without taking her eyes from it , she clasped her hands , and , what is terrible to relate of a child of that age , she wrung them ; then -- not one of the emotions of the day , neither the trip to the forest , nor the weight of the bucket of water , nor the loss of the money , nor the sight of the whip , nor even the sad words which she had heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her -- she wept ; she burst out sobbing .
