The ravine was there , unexpected , yawning , directly under the horses ' feet , two fathoms deep between its double slopes ; the second file pushed the first into it , and the third pushed on the second ; the horses reared and fell backward , landed on their haunches , slid down , all four feet in the air , crushing and overwhelming the riders ; and there being no means of retreat , -- the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile , -- the force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed the French ; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled ; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell , grinding each other , forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf : when this trench was full of living men , the rest marched over them and passed on .
