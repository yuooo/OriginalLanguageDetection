Move about as much as you like ; walk up and down in any part of the room , write , efface , destroy , burn , - nothing like that will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from snoring , but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door , for I should start up in a moment , and that would shake my nerves and make me ill .
