`` Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful ; the Maccabees call you the Creator ; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty ; Baruch calls you Immensity ; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth ; John calls you Light ; the Books of Kings call you Lord ; Exodus calls you Providence ; Leviticus , Sanctity ; Esdras , Justice ; the creation calls you God ; man calls you Father ; but Solomon calls you Compassion , and that is the most beautiful of all your names .
