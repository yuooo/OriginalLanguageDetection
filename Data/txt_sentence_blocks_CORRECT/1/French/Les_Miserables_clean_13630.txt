Everything that surrounded him , that peaceful garden , those fragrant flowers , those children who uttered joyous cries , those grave and simple women , that silent cloister , slowly permeated him , and little by little , his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister , of perfume like the flowers , of simplicity like the women , of joy like the children .
