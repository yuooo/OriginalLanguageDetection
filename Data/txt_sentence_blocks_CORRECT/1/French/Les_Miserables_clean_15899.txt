To appear and to reign , to march and to triumph , to have for halting-places all capitals , to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them , to decree the falls of dynasties , and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge ; to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God ; to follow in a single man , Hannibal , Caesar , Charlemagne ; to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in the morning , to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever , Marengo , Arcola , Austerlitz , Jena , Wagram !
