But there was no time ; the explosion thundered , earth gaped , the smoke which hurled through the clefts obscured the sky ; the sea flowed back as though driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if from the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera ; the reflux took the bark out twenty toises ; the solid rocks cracked to their base , and separated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge ; a portion of the vault was carried up towards heaven , as if it had been built of cardboard ; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of liquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome of smoke ; then oscillated , declined , and fell successively the mighty monoliths of rock which the violence of the explosion had not been able to uproot from the bed of ages ; they bowed to each other like grave and stiff old men , then prostrating themselves , lay down forever in their dusty tomb .
