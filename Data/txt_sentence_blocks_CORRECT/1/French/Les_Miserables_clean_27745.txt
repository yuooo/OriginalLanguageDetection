A quarter of a league away , from the corner of the Rue du Temple which debouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud ` Eau , if one thrust one 's head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop , one perceived in the distance , beyond the canal , in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise , a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts , a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left , as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly .
