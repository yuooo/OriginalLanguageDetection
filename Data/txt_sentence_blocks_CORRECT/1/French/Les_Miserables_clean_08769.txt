The Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time ; in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed ; it had gone into the dry dock the year before this , in order to have the barnacles scraped off , then it had put to sea again ; but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel : in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sides had been strained and had opened ; and , as the plating in those days was not of sheet iron , the vessel had sprung a leak .
