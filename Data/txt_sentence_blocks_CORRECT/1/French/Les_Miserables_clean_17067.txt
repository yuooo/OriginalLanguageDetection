COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus , winding like a serpent among the police , and striving to escape Vidocq 's indiscreet glances `` under divers forms , tree , flame , fountain , '' lending each other their names and their traps , hiding in their own shadows , boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other , stripping off their personalities , as one removes his false nose at a masked ball , sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual , sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a whole throng .
