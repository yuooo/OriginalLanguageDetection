You have your thirty-two teeth , a good digestion , bright eyes , strength , appetite , health , gayety , a forest of black hair ; I have no longer even white hair , I have lost my teeth , I am losing my legs , I am losing my memory ; there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly , the Rue Charlot , the Rue du Chaume , and the Rue Saint-Claude , that is what I have come to ; you have before you the whole future , full of sunshine , and I am beginning to lose my sight , so far am I advancing into the night ; you are in love , that is a matter of course , I am beloved by no one in all the world ; and you ask pity of me !
