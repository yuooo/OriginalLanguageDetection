It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon , invaded by vermin and oblivion , covered with warts , with mould , and ulcers , tottering , worm-eaten , abandoned , condemned , a sort of mendicant colossus , asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads , had taken pity on that other mendicant , the poor pygmy , who roamed without shoes to his feet , without a roof over his head , blowing on his fingers , clad in rags , fed on rejected scraps .
