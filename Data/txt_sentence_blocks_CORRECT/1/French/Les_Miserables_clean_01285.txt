Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy : let a false Corneille compose Tiridate ; let a eunuch come to possess a harem ; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch ; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse , and construct for himself , out of this cardboard , sold as leather , four hundred thousand francs of income ; let a pork-packer espouse usury , and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions , of which he is the father and of which it is the mother ; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl ; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances , -- and men call that Genius , just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty , and the mien of Claude Majesty .
