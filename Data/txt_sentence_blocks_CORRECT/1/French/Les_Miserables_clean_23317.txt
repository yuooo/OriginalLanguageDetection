The tongue which is employed on board ship , that wonderful language of the sea , which is so complete and so picturesque , which was spoken by Jean Bart , Duquesne , Suffren , and Duperre , which mingles with the whistling of the rigging , the sound of the speaking-trumpets , the shock of the boarding-irons , the roll of the sea , the wind , the gale , the cannon , is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang , which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal .
