It might be that I happened to arrive at your door just as your guests or your friends had left you - or , if they had not gone yet , I should wait until they were leaving , and should then catch them one after the other , like rabbits ; I should lock them up quietly enough , I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor , and with one hand upon you , before you suspected the slightest thing amiss , I should keep you safely until my master 's breakfast in the morning .
