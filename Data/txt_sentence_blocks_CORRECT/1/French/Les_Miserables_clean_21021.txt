In the evening , a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it ; a shroud of mist , a calm and celestial sadness covered it ; the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it , like an exquisite and subtle poison ; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches ; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees ; by day the wings rejoice the leaves , by night the leaves protect the wings .
