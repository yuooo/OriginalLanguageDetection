The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows : Leaving Bombay , it passes through Salcette , crossing to the continent opposite Tannah , goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts , runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor , skirts the nearly independent territory of Bundelcund , ascends to Allahabad , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the Ganges at Benares , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor , has its terminus at Calcutta .
