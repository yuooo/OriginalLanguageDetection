Oh ! 
thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness , have mercy on this small black boy down here ; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear ! 
Moby Dick I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul . 
A wild , mystical , sympathetical feeling was in me ; Ahab 's quenchless feud seemed mine . 
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge . 
For some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen . 
But not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed . 
For , owing to the large number of whale-cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick . 
It was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , has completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , I say , that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick . 
Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause . 
In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded . 
And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species . 
But at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come . 
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters . 
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events , -- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to . 
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there . 
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them . 
Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiselled hearth-stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth . 
No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the wildest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears . 
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw . 
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work . 
Nor even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body . 
There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling . 
Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him . 
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- Olassen and Povelson -- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood . 
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier 's , were these or almost similar impressions effaced . 
For in his Natural History , the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale , all fish -LRB- sharks included -RRB- are `` struck with the most lively terrors , '' and `` often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death . '' 
And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters . 
So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to Moby Dick , the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lances at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man . 
That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity . 
On this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted . 
Nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered . 
One of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time . 
Nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability . 
For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points . 
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas . 
Nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days . 
Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ' West Passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale . 
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal -LRB- near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface -RRB- ; and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse -LRB- whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage -RRB- ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen . 
Forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal -LRB- for immortality is but ubiquity in time -RRB- ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen . 
But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power . 
For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump . 
These were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him . 
The rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings . 
Nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults . 
More than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else . 
For , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn around suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship . 
Already several fatalities had attended his chase . 
But though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale 's infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent . 
Judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale 's direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal . 
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line-knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale . 
That captain was Ahab . 
And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab 's leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . 
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . 
Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . 
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . 
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ; -- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it . 
All that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy Ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in Moby Dick . 
He piled upon the whale 's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart 's shell upon it . 
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment . 
Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more . 
Yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling Patagonian Cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad . 
That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock . 
In a strait-jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales . 
And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ` sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man 's delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , raved on . 
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing . 
When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form . 
Ahab 's full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated Hudson , when that noble Northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge . 
But , as in his narrow-flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab 's broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . 
That before living agent , now became the living instrument . 
If such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object . 
This is much ; yet Ahab 's larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted . 
But vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound . 
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ; -- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man 's upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes ! 
So with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a Caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages . 
Wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls ! 
question that proud , sad king ! 
A family likeness ! 
aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come . 
Now , in his heart , Ahab had some glimpse of this , namely ; all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad . 
Yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble ; in some sort , did still . 
But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate . 
Nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him . 
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause . 
And so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow . 
Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales . 
Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes . 
Or , if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that , yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack . 
But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale . 
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man ! 
They were bent on profitable cruises , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint . 
He was intent on an audacious , immitigable , and supernatural revenge . 
Here , then , was this grey-headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job 's whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck , the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask . 
Such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge . 
How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man 's ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life , -- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go . 
The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ? 
Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ? 
What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still ? 
For one , I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill . 
The Whiteness of The Whale What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid . 
Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , which could not but occasionally awaken in any man 's soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form . 
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me . 
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught . 
Though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of Pegu placing the title `` Lord of the White Elephants '' above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire , Caesarian , heir to overlording Rome , having for the imperial color the same imperial hue ; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things -- the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the Persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull ; and though to the noble Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord ; though in the Vision of St. John , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne , and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honorable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood . 
This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds . 
Witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are ? 
That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , to the dumb gloating of their aspect . 
So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark . 
* * With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . 
But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror . 
As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped . 
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish . 
The Romish mass for the dead begins with `` Requiem eternam '' -LRB- eternal rest -RRB- , whence Requiem denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music . 
Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French call him Requin . 
Bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ? 
Not Coleridge first threw that spell ; but God 's great , unflattering laureate , Nature . 
* * I remember the first albatross I ever saw . 
It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas . 
From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime . 
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . 
Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . 
Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress . 
Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God . 
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . 
Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage . 
I can not tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . 
But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this . 
A goney , he replied . 
Goney ! 
never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore ! 
never ! 
But some time after , I learned that goney was some seaman 's name for albatross . 
So that by no possibility could Coleridge 's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck . 
For neither had I then read the Rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross . 
Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet . 
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl . 
But how had the mystic thing been caught ? 
Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea . 
At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship 's time and place ; and then letting it escape . 
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim ! 
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk-white charger , large-eyed , small-headed , bluff-chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . 
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies . 
At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light . 
The flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him . 
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god , bluff-bowed and fearless as this mighty steed . 
Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe . 
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror . 
But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross . 
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin ! 
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears . 
The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion . 
Why should this be so ? 
Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible . 
From its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall . 
Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . 
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place ! 
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue . 
It can not well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here . 
And from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them . 
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog -- Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse . 
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul . 
But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ? 
To analyse it , would seem impossible . 
Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ; -- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ? 
Let us try . 
But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls . 
And though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now . 
Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims , down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow ? 
Or to the unread , unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States , why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ? 
Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings -LRB- which will not wholly account for it -RRB- that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American , than those other storied structures , its neighbors -- the Byward Tower , or even the Bloody ? 
And those sublimer towers , the White Mountains of New Hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of Virginia 's Blue Ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ? 
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ? 
Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does `` the tall pale man '' of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ? 
Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope-stones , and crosses all adroop -LRB- like canted yards of anchored fleets -RRB- ; and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ; -- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ` st see . 
For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe . 
Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions . 
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality . 
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples . 
First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again . 
Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , `` Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ? '' 
Second : To the native Indian of Peru , the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes , and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes . 
Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West , who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow , no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness . 
Not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses . 
But thou sayest , methinks this white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael . 
Tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he can not even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ? 
There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells can not recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this New England colt , of the black bisons of distant Oregon ? 
No ; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world . 
Though thousands of miles from Oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust . 
Thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to Ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt ! 
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must exist . 
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible spheres were formed in fright . 
But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous -- why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the Christian 's Deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind . 
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ? 
Or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color ; and at the same time the concrete of all colors ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows -- a colorless , all-color of atheism from which we shrink ? 
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colorless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in Lapland , who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him . 
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol . 
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ? . . 
Hark ! 
`` HIST ! 
Did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? 
It was the middle-watch : a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist , to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail . 
In this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt . 
Standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet . 
From hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel . 
It was in the midst of this repose , that Archy , one of the cordon , whose post was near the after-hatches , whispered to his neighbor , a Cholo , the words above . 
`` Hist ! 
did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? '' 
`` Take the bucket , will ye , Archy ? 
what noise d'ye mean ? '' 
`` There it is again -- under the hatches -- do n't you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough . '' 
`` Cough be damned ! 
Pass along that return bucket . '' 
`` There again -- there it is ! 
-- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now ! '' 
`` Caramba ! 
have done , shipmate , will ye ? 
It 's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else . 
Look to the bucket ! '' 
`` Say what ye will , shipmate ; I 've sharp ears . '' 
`` Aye , you are the chap , ai n't ye , that heard the hum of the old Quakeress 's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket ; you 're the chap . '' 
`` Grin away ; we 'll see what turns up . 
Hark ye , Cabaco , there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too . 
I heard Stubb tell Flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind . '' 
`` Tish ! 
the bucket ! '' 
The Chart Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed-down table . 
Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank . 
At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen . 
While thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead . 
But it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , Ahab thus pondered over his charts . 
Almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted . 
For with the charts of all four oceans before him , Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul . 
Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet . 
But not so did it seem to Ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale 's food ; and , also calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey . 
So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale 's resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows . 
On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale . 
* * Since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of the National Observatory , Washington , April 16th , 1851 . 
By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular . 
`` This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen . '' 
Besides , when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the Deity -- mostly swim in veins , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision . 
Though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor 's parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width -LRB- more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract -RRB- ; but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship 's mast-heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone . 
The sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for . 
And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding-grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting . 
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme . 
But not so in the reality , perhaps . 
Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you can not conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true . 
In general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales . 
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean , or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast ; yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there . 
So , too , with some other feeding-grounds , where he had at times revealed himself . 
But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode . 
And where Ahab 's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way-side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as Ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty . 
That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the Season-on-the-Line . 
For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac . 
There it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . 
But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest . 
Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season-on-the-Line . 
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there . 
Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . 
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod 's sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . 
Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race . 
So that Monsoons , Pampas , Nor-Westers , Harmattans , Trades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon , might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod 's circumnavigating wake . 
But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ? 
Yes . 
For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow-white hump , could not but be unmistakable . 
And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ? 
His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep 's ear ! 
And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ! 
and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength . 
Ah , God ! 
what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire . 
He sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms . 
Often , when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies , and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base , and a chasm seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and lightnings shot up , and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room , as though escaping from a bed that was on fire . 
Yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity . 
For , at such times , crazy Ahab , the scheming , unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again . 
The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral . 
But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in Ahab 's case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed , independent being of its own . 
Nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was conjoined , fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth . 
Therefore , the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes , when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a vacated thing , a formless somnambulistic being , a ray of living light , to be sure , but without an object to color , and therefore a blankness in itself . 
God help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates . 
The Affidavit So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair . 
I care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items , practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman ; and from these citations , I take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself . 
First : I have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval -LRB- in one instance of three years -RRB- , has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body . 
In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and I think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions . 
Meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose . 
This man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other . 
I say I , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish . 
In the three-year instance , it so fell out that I was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale 's eye , which I had observed there three years previous . 
I say three years , but I am pretty sure it was more than that . 
Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach . 
Secondly : It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable . 
Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil . 
No : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance . 
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to known an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption . 
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity -- nay , you may call it an oceanwide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was admitted into all the rights , privileges , and distinctions of a name ; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar . 
Was it not so , O Timor Tom ! 
thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did ` st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay ? 
Was it not so , O New Zealand Jack ! 
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land ? 
Was it not so , O Morquan ! 
King of Japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky ? 
Was it not so , O Don Miguel ! 
thou Chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back ! 
In plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar . 
But this is not all . 
New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel , after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , systematically hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view , as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods , Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon , the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip . 
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the catastrophe . 
For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error . 
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory . 
First : Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur . 
One reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record . 
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow 's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast ? 
No : because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea . 
In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ? 
Yet I will tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat 's crew . 
For God 's sake , be economical with your lamps and candles ! 
not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man 's blood was spilled for it . 
Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt . 
But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own . 
That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale has done it . 
First : In the year 1820 the ship Essex , Captain Pollard , of Nantucket , was cruising in the Pacific Ocean . 
One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales . 
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship . 
Dashing his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than `` ten minutes '' she settled down and fell over . 
Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since . 
After the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats . 
Being returned home at last , Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never attempted it since . 
At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket . 
I have seen Owen Chace , who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; I have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe . 
* * The following are extracts from Chace 's narrative : `` Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of this catastrophe I have never chanced to their direction , were calculated to do us the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it . 
Thirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J -- then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu , Sandwich Islands . 
Conversation turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present . 
He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful . 
Very good ; but there is more coming . 
Some weeks later , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso . 
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him . 
That business consisted in fetching the Commodore 's craft such a thwack , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair . 
I am not superstitious , but I consider the Commodore 's interview with that whale as providential . 
Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ? 
I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense . 
I will now refer you to Langsdorff 's Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof . 
Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern 's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century . 
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter : `` By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to Ochotsh . 
The weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing . 
For some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up . 
An uncommonly large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him . 
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water . 
The masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity . 
Captain D'Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured . '' 
Now , the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a New Englander , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain , this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston . 
I have the honor of being a nephew of his . 
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff . 
He substantiates every word . 
The ship , however , was by no means a large one : a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home . 
In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of Lionel Wafer , one of ancient Dampier 's old chums -- I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff , that I can not forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed . 
Lionel , it seems , was on his way to `` John Ferdinando , '' as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes . 
`` In our way thither , '' he says , `` about four o'clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to prepare for death . 
And , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground . 
... The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks . 
Captain Davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin ! '' 
Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land . 
But I should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath . 
I might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale . 
In more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks . 
The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ! 
the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart . 
Again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes . 
But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels -LRB- like all marvels -RRB- are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon -- Verily there is nothing new under the sun . 
In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius , a Christian magistrate of Constantinople , in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general . 
As many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value . 
By the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned . 
Now , in this history of his , Procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople , a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis , or Sea of Marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years . 
A fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsaid . 
Nor is there any reason it should be . 
Of what precise species this sea-monster was , is not mentioned . 
But as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale . 
And I will tell you why . 
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it . 
Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort . 
But further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean . 
I am told , on good authority , that on the Barbary coast , a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale . 
Now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis . 
In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found , the aliment of the right whale . 
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle-fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface . 
If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , Procopius 's sea-monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale . 
Surmises Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman 's ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage . 
Or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him . 
It would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted . 
But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him . 
To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order . 
He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation . 
Starbuck 's body and Starbuck 's coerced will were Ahab 's , so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck 's brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain 's quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it . 
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen . 
During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain 's leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him . 
Not only that , but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background -LRB- for few men 's courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action -RRB- ; that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick . 
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash . 
Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing . 
In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent . 
The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought Ahab , is sordidness . 
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites . 
For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way . 
Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust . 
I will not strip these men , thought Ahab , of all hopes of cash -- aye , cash . 
They may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier Ahab . 
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally . 
Having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod 's voyage , Ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command . 
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself . 
That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to . 
For all these reasons then , and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here , Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , nominal purpose of the Pequod 's voyage ; observe all customary usages ; and not only that , but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession . 
Be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise . 
This vigilance was not long without reward . 
The Mat-Maker It was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters . 
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat , for an additional lashing to our boat . 
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene , and such an incantation of revelry lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self . 
I was the attendant or page of Queequeg , while busy at the mat . 
As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as Queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn ; I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time , and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates . 
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own . 
This warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought I , with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads . 
Meantime , Queequeg 's impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage 's sword , thought I , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance -- aye , chance , free will , and necessity -- no wise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together . 
The straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events . 
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing . 
High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header , Tashtego . 
His body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a wand , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries . 
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen 's look-outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian 's . 
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming . 
`` There she blows ! 
there ! 
there ! 
there ! 
she blows ! 
she blows ! '' 
`` Where-away ? '' 
`` On the lee-beam , about two miles off ! 
a school of them ! '' 
Instantly all was commotion . 
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity . 
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus . 
`` There go flukes ! '' 
was now the cry from Tashtego ; and the whales disappeared . 
`` Quick , steward ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
`` Time ! 
time ! '' 
Dough-Boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to Ahab . 
The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it . 
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows . 
For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while concealed beneath the surface , mills around , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter -- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity . 
One of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head . 
The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs . 
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale . 
So look the long line of man-of-war 's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy 's ship . 
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale . 
With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air . 
The First Lowering The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there . 
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain 's , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter . 
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips . 
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff . 
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . 
Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ; -- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere . 
While yet the wondering ship 's company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head , `` All ready there , Fedallah ? '' 
`` Ready , '' was the half-hissed reply . 
`` Lower away then ; d'ye hear ? '' 
shouting across the deck . 
`` Lower away there , I say . '' 
Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off-handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat-like , leaped down the rolling ship 's side into the tossed boats below . 
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship 's lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large expanse of water . 
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command . 
`` Captain Ahab ? 
- '' said Starbuck . 
`` Spread yourselves , '' cried Ahab ; `` give way , all four boats . 
Thou , Flask , pull out more to leeward ! '' 
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cheerily cried little King-Post , sweeping round his great steering oar . 
`` Lay back ! '' 
addressing his crew . 
`` There ! 
-- there ! 
-- there again ! 
There she blows right ahead , boys ! 
-- lay back ! 
`` Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy . '' 
`` Oh , I do n't mind 'em , sir , '' said Archy ; `` I knew it all before now . 
Did n't I hear 'em in the hold ? 
And did n't I tell Cabaco here of it ? 
What say ye , Cabaco ? 
They are stowaways , Mr. Flask . '' 
`` Pull , pull , my fine hearts-alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones , '' drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness . 
`` Why do n't you break your backbones , my boys ? 
What is it you stare at ? 
Those chaps in yonder boat ? 
Tut ! 
They are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the more the merrier . 
Pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough . 
So , so ; there you are now ; that 's the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that 's the stroke to sweep the stakes ! 
Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes ! 
Three cheers , men -- all hearts alive ! 
Easy , easy ; do n't be in a hurry -- do n't be in a hurry . 
Why do n't you snap your oars , you rascals ? 
Bite something , you dogs ! 
So , so , so , then : -- softly , softly ! 
That 's it -- that 's it ! 
long and strong . 
Give way there , give way ! 
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep . 
Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull . 
Pull , will ye ? 
pull , ca n't ye ? 
pull , wo n't ye ? 
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes do n't ye pull ? 
-- pull and break something ! 
pull , and start your eyes out ! 
Here , '' whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; `` every mother 's son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth . 
That 's it -- that 's it . 
Now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel-bits . 
Start her -- start her , my silverspoons ! 
Start her , marling-spikes ! '' 
Stubb 's exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing . 
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation . 
Not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . 
He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing . 
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering-oar , and so broadly gaped -- open-mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew . 
Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them . 
In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb 's bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate . 
`` Mr. Starbuck ! 
larboard boat there , ahoy ! 
a word with ye , sir , if ye please ! '' 
`` Halloa ! '' 
returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb 's . 
`` What think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! 
`` Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . 
-LRB- Strong , strong , boys ! -RRB- '' 
in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : `` A sad business , Mr. Stubb ! 
-LRB- seethe her , seethe her , my lads ! -RRB- 
but never mind , Mr. Stubb , all for the best . 
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will . 
-LRB- Spring , my men , spring ! -RRB- 
There 's hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr. Stubb , and that 's what ye came for . 
-LRB- Pull , my boys ! -RRB- 
Sperm , sperm 's the play ! 
This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand . '' 
`` Aye , aye , I thought as much , '' soliloquized Stubb , when the boats diverged , `` as soon as I clapt eye on 'em , I thought so . 
Aye , and that 's what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough-Boy long suspected . 
They were hidden down there . 
The White Whale 's at the bottom of it . 
Well , well , so be it ! 
Ca n't be helped ! 
All right ! 
Give way men ! 
It ai n't the White Whale to-day ! 
Give way ! '' 
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship 's company ; but Archy 's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event . 
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb 's confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab 's precise agency in the matter from the beginning . 
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah . 
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him . 
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer . 
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer 's , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him . 
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat 's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . 
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea . 
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way . 
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it . 
`` Every man look out along his oars ! '' 
cried Starbuck . 
`` Thou , Queequeg , stand up ! '' 
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried . 
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea . 
Not very far distant Flask 's boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform . 
It is used for catching turns with the whale line . 
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man 's hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks . 
But little King-Post was small and short , and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this logger head stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post . 
`` I ca n't see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me onto that . '' 
Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal . 
`` Good a mast-head as any , sir . 
Will you mount ? '' 
`` That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet taller . '' 
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask 's foot , and then putting Flask 's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders . 
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . 
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas . 
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the logger head itself , under such circumstances . 
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form . 
On his broad back , flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake . 
The bearer looked nobler than the rider . 
Though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro 's lordly chest . 
So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that . 
Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes . 
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe . 
He withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather . 
He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , `` Down , down all , and give way ! 
-- there they are ! '' 
To a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it , and suffusingly blowing off to leeward , like the confused scud from white rolling billows . 
The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron . 
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming . 
Seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapor they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders . 
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air . 
But it bade far to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills . 
`` Pull , pull , my good boys , '' said Starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses . 
He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him . 
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty . 
How different the loud little King-Post . 
`` Sing out and say something , my hearties . 
Roar and pull , my thunderbolts ! 
Beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I 'll sign over to you my Martha 's Vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys . 
Lay me on -- lay me on ! 
O Lord , Lord ! 
but I shall go stark , staring mad ! 
See ! 
see that white water ! '' 
And so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat 's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie . 
`` Look at that chap now , '' philosophically drawled Stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after -- `` He 's got fits , that Flask has . 
Fits ? 
yes , give him fits -- that 's the very word -- pitch fits into 'em . 
Merrily , merrily , hearts-alive . 
Pudding for supper , you know ; -- merry 's the word . 
Pull , babes -- pull , sucklings -- pull , all . 
But what the devil are you hurrying about ? 
Softly , softly , and steadily , my men . 
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more . 
Crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that 's all . 
Take it easy -- why do n't ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs ! '' 
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land . 
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam-glued lips , Ahab leaped after his prey . 
Meanwhile , all the boats tore on . 
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to `` that whale , '' as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat 's bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over his shoulder . 
But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears ; and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments . 
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe ! 
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled-like slide down its other side ; -- all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ; -- all this was thrilling . 
Not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man 's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ; -- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale . 
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea . 
The jets of vapor no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes . 
The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward . 
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks . 
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . 
`` Give way , men , '' whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; `` there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . 
There 's white water again ! 
-- close to ! 
Spring ! '' 
Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said : `` Stand up ! '' 
and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet . 
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter . 
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents . 
`` That 's his hump . 
There , there , give it to him ! '' 
whispered Starbuck . 
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg . 
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us . 
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall . 
Squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped . 
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed . 
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places . 
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean . 
The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! 
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . 
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . 
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . 
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life-preservers . 
So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . 
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . 
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . 
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . 
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat . 
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . 
We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . 
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . 
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length . 
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship 's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern . 
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board . 
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time . 
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing , -- an oar or a lance pole . 
The Hyena There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody 's expense but his own . 
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing . 
He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints . 
And as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good-natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker . 
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke . 
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; `` Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ? '' 
Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen . 
`` Mr. Stubb , '' said I , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil-jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; `` Mr. Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr. Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent . 
I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman 's discretion ? '' 
`` Certain . 
I 've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn . '' 
`` Mr. Flask , '' said I , turning to little King-Post , who was standing close by ; `` you are experienced in these things , and I am not . 
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr. Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death 's jaws ? '' 
`` Ca n't you twist that smaller ? '' 
said Flask . 
`` Yes , that 's the law . 
I should like to see a boat 's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost . 
Ha , ha ! 
the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that ! '' 
Here then , from three impartial witnesses , I had a deliberate statement of the entire case . 
Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck 's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck 's boat ; and finally considering in what a devil 's chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , `` come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee . '' 
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . 
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing . 
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , I felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart . 
Besides , all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be . 
I survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest . 
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault . 
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost . 
Ahab 's Boat and Crew . 
Fedallah `` Who would have thought it , Flask ! '' 
cried Stubb ; `` if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe . 
Oh ! 
he 's a wonderful old man ! '' 
`` I do n't think it so strange , after all , on that account , '' said Flask . 
`` If his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing . 
That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know . '' 
`` I do n't know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel . '' 
Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase . 
So Tamerlane 's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight . 
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect . 
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt ? 
As a general thing , the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not . 
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat 's crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod . 
Therefore he had not solicited a boat 's crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . 
Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . 
Until Cabaco 's published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat 's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter 's chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time . 
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person . 
But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat 's crew being assigned to that boat . 
Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane . 
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown-off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle . 
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last . 
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab 's peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew . 
But one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah . 
He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth 's primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to Genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical Robbins , indulged in mundane amours . 
The Spirit-Spout Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate -LRB- so called -RRB- , being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St. Helena . 
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . 
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . 
Fedallah first descried this jet . 
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . 
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them . 
You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky . 
But when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon-lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew . 
`` There she blows ! '' 
Had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure . 
For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering . 
Walking the deck with quick , side-lunging strides , Ahab commanded the t ` gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread . 
The best man in the ship must take the helm . 
Then , with every mast-head manned , the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind . 
The strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal . 
And had you watched Ahab 's face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring . 
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap . 
On life and death this old man walked . 
But though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night . 
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time . 
This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo ! 
at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been . 
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it . 
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on . 
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick . 
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas . 
These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow . 
But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before . 
Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens . 
And every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves . 
And heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred . 
Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ? 
Rather Cape Tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon . 
But calm , snow-white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried . 
During all this blackness of the elements , Ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates . 
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale . 
Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists . 
So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together . 
Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt . 
Few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves . 
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast . 
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock . 
Never could Starbuck forget the old man 's aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair ; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat . 
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of . 
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand . 
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling . 
* * The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . 
Terrible old man ! 
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . 
The Albatross South-eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney -LRB- Albatross -RRB- by name . 
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home . 
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . 
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost . 
Only her lower sails were set . 
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . 
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising . 
Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn-looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look-outs , while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below . 
`` Ship ahoy ! 
Have ye seen the White Whale ? '' 
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . 
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us . 
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale 's name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . 
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed -- `` Ahoy there ! 
This is the Pequod , bound round the world ! 
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean ! 
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to - '' At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger 's flanks . 
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings . 
`` Swim away from me , do ye ? '' 
murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water . 
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced . 
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice , -- `` Up helm ! 
Keep her off round the world ! '' 
Round the world ! 
There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ? 
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us . 
Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage . 
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed . 
The Gam The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . 
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put . 
For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought . 
But all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising-ground . 
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State , or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , can not well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone Fanning 's Island , or the far away King 's Mills ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact . 
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about . 
For the long absent ship , the outward-bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files . 
And in return for that courtesy , the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her . 
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other 's track on the cruising-ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home . 
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets . 
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat . 
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils . 
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English . 
Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there . 
is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself . 
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea-peasant . 
But where this superiority in the English whaleman does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years . 
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself . 
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so . 
Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other 's wake in the mid-Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other 's rig . 
As for Men-of-War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all . 
As touching Slave-ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . 
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other 's cross-bones , the first hail is -- `` How many skulls ? '' 
-- the same way that whalers hail -- `` How many barrels ? '' 
And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and do n't like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likenesses . 
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! 
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? 
She has a `` Gam , '' a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about `` spouters '' and `` blubber-boilers , '' and such like pretty exclamations . 
Why it is that all Merchant-seamen , and also all Pirates and Man-of-War 's men , and Slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer . 
Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . 
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . 
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . 
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . 
But what is a Gam ? 
You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word , Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster 's ark does not hold it . 
Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees . 
Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon . 
With that view , let me learnedly define it . 
GAM . 
NOUN -- A social meeting of two -LRB- or more -RRB- Whaleships , generally on a cruising-ground ; when , after exchanging hails , they exchange visits by boats ' crews , the two captains remaining , for the time , on board of one ship , and the two chief mates on the other . 
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here . 
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . 
In a pirate , man-of-war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . 
But the whale-boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all . 
High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs . 
And as for a tiller , the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat 's crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree . 
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs . 
Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front . 
He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth . 
Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you can not stand them up . 
Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world 's riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self-command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast . 
Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman 's hair , and hold on there like grim death . 
The Town-Ho 's Story -LRB- As told at the Golden Inn -RRB- The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part . 
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound whaleman , the Town-Ho , * was encountered . 
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians . 
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick . 
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho 's story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men . 
This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates . 
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself . 
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . 
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod 's main-mast . 
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record . 
* The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin . 
For my humor 's sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint 's eve , smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn . 
Of those fine cavaliers , the young Dons , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time . 
`` Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the Town-Ho , Sperm Whaler of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn . 
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line . 
One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common . 
They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her , gentlemen . 
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased . 
So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired . 
`` Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her . 
In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo . '' 
` Lakeman ! 
-- Buffalo ! 
Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ? ' 
said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . 
`` On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . 
Now , gentlemen , in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships , well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land-locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean . 
For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh-water seas of ours , -- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan , -- possess an ocean-like expansiveness , with many of the ocean 's noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . 
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew . 
Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild-ocean born , and wild-ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any . 
And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives . 
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave 's right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile . 
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear . 
`` It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town-Ho 's leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . 
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . 
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ! 
that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . 
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious . 
`` Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate . 
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . 
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen . 
Therefore when he betrayed this imagine , solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her . 
So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes . 
`` Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . 
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy 's snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne 's father . 
But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . 
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it . 
`` Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings . '' 
` Aye , aye , my merry lads , it 's a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let 's have a taste . 
By the Lord , it 's worth bottling ! 
I tell ye what , men , old Rad 's investment must go for it ! 
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home . 
The fact is , boys , that sword-fish only began the job ; he 's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters , saw-fish , and file-fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose . 
If old Rad were here now , I 'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em . 
They 're playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him . 
But he 's a simple old soul , -- Rad , and a beauty too . 
Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses . 
I wonder if he 'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose . ' '' 
` Damn your eyes ! 
what 's that pump stopping for ? ' 
roared Radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ' talk . 
` Thunder away at it ! ' 
` Aye , aye , sir , ' said Steelkilt , merry as a cricket . 
` Lively , boys , lively , now ! ' 
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life 's utmost energies . 
`` Quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . 
Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened . 
Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large . 
`` Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship 's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . 
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . 
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . 
Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades . 
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men . 
`` But there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had spat in his face . 
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command . 
But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate 's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt . 
`` Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it . 
And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads , as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day . 
To this , Radney replied , with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper 's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by . 
`` Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding . 
`` Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey . 
Seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose . 
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer : '' ` Mr. Radney , I will not obey you . 
Take that hammer away , or look to yourself . ' 
But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions . 
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , Steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he -LRB- Steelkilt -RRB- would murder him . 
But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods . 
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale . 
`` Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads . 
They were both Canallers . '' 
` Canallers ! ' 
cried Don Pedro . 
` We have seen many whaleships in our harbors , but never heard of your Canallers . 
Pardon : who and what are they ? ' '' 
` Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal . 
You must have heard of it . ' '' 
` Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North . ' ''
