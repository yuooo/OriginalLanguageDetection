Can you inform us , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch began , with extreme gentleness , `` where did you get so much money all of a sudden , when it appears from the facts , from the reckoning of time , that you had not been home ? '' 
The prosecutor 's brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly , but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` No , I did n't go home , '' answered Mitya , apparently perfectly composed , but looking at the floor . 
`` Allow me then to repeat my question , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as though creeping up to the subject . 
`` Where were you able to procure such a sum all at once , when by your own confession , at five o'clock the same day you - '' `` I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin , and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she would n't give me , and so on , and all the rest of it , '' Mitya interrupted sharply . 
`` Yes , gentlemen , I was in want of it , and suddenly thousands turned up , eh ? 
Do you know , gentlemen , you 're both afraid now ` what if he wo n't tell us where he got it ? ' 
That 's just how it is . 
I 'm not going to tell you , gentlemen . 
You 've guessed right . 
You 'll never know , '' said Mitya , chipping out each word with extraordinary determination . 
The lawyers were silent for a moment . 
`` You must understand , Mr. Karamazov , that it is of vital importance for us to know , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , softly and suavely . 
`` I understand ; but still I wo n't tell you . '' 
The prosecutor , too , intervened , and again reminded the prisoner that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions , if he thought it to his interest , and so on . 
But in view of the damage he might do himself by his silence , especially in a case of such importance as - `` And so on , gentlemen , and so on . 
Enough ! 
I 've heard that rigmarole before , '' Mitya interrupted again . 
`` I can see for myself how important it is , and that this is the vital point , and still I wo n't say . '' 
`` What is it to us ? 
It 's not our business , but yours . . 
You are doing yourself harm , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously . 
`` You see , gentlemen , joking apart '' - Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly at them both - `` I had an inkling from the first that we should come to loggerheads at this point . 
But at first when I began to give my evidence , it was all still far away and misty ; it was all floating , and I was so simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing between us . 
Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the question , for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block . 
And now we 've come to it ! 
It 's impossible and there 's an end of it ! 
But I do n't blame you . 
You ca n't believe it all simply on my word . 
I understand that , of course . '' 
He relapsed into gloomy silence . 
`` Could n't you , without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point , could you not , at the same time , give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer , at a crisis so full of danger to you ? '' 
Mitya smiled mournfully , almost dreamily . 
`` I 'm much more good-natured than you think , gentlemen . 
I 'll tell you the reason why and give you that hint , though you do n't deserve it . 
I wo n't speak of that , gentlemen , because it would be a stain on my honour . 
The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father , if I had murdered and robbed him . 
That 's why I ca n't tell you . 
I ca n't for fear of disgrace . 
What , gentlemen , are you going to write that down ? '' 
`` Yes , we 'll write it down , '' lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You ought not to write that down about ` disgrace . ' 
I only told you that in the goodness of my heart . 
I need n't have told you . 
I made you a present of it , so to speak , and you pounce upon it at once . 
Oh , well , write - write what you like , '' he concluded , with scornful disgust . 
`` I 'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my head before you . '' 
`` And ca n't you tell us the nature of that disgrace ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hazarded . 
The prosecutor frowned darkly . 
`` No , no , c'est fini , do n't trouble yourselves . 
It 's not worth while soiling one 's hands . 
I have soiled myself enough through you as it is . 
You 're not worth it - no one is . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I 'm not going on . '' 
This was said too peremptorily . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist further , but from Ippolit Kirillovitch 's eyes he saw that he had not given up hope . 
`` Can you not , at least , tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into Mr. Perhotin 's - how many roubles exactly ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that . '' 
`` You spoke to Mr. Perhotin , I believe , of having received three thousand from Madame Hohlakov . '' 
`` Perhaps I did . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I wo n't say how much I had . '' 
`` Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you have done since you arrived ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you might ask the people here about that . 
But I 'll tell you if you like . '' 
He proceeded to do so , but we wo n't repeat his story . 
He told it dryly and curtly . 
Of the raptures of his love he said nothing , but told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself , owing to `` new factors in the case . '' 
He told the story without going into motives or details . 
And this time the lawyers did not worry him much . 
It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here . 
`` We shall verify all that . 
We will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses , which will , of course , take place in your presence , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion . 
`` And now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession , especially all the money you still have about you . '' 
`` My money , gentlemen ? 
Certainly . 
I understand that that is necessary . 
I 'm surprised , indeed , that you have n't inquired about it before . 
It 's true I could n't get away anywhere . 
I 'm sitting here where I can be seen . 
But here 's my money - count it - take it . 
That 's all , I think . '' 
He turned it all out of his pockets ; even the small change - two pieces of twenty copecks - he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket . 
They counted the money , which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles , and forty copecks . 
`` And is that all ? '' 
asked the investigating lawyer . 
`` You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at Plotnikovs ' . 
You gave Perhotin ten , your driver twenty , here you lost two hundred , then ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up . 
Mitya helped him readily . 
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total . 
`` With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first ? '' 
`` I suppose so , '' snapped Mitya . 
`` How is it they all assert there was much more ? '' 
`` Let them assert it . '' 
`` But you asserted it yourself . '' 
`` Yes , I did , too . '' 
`` We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet examined . 
Do n't be anxious about your money . 
It will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning ... if it appears , or , so to speak , is proved that you have undisputed right to it . 
Well , and now ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up , and informed Mitya firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search `` of your clothes and everything else ... '' `` By all means , gentlemen . 
I 'll turn out all my pockets , if you like . '' 
And he did , in fact , begin turning out his pockets . 
`` It will be necessary to take off your clothes , too . '' 
`` What ! 
Undress ? 
Ugh ! 
Damn it ! 
Wo n't you search me as I am ? 
Ca n't you ? '' 
`` It 's utterly impossible , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You must take off your clothes . '' 
`` As you like , '' Mitya submitted gloomily ; `` only , please , not here , but behind the curtains . 
Who will search them ? '' 
`` Behind the curtains , of course . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent . 
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity . 
The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny . 
`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya . 
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers . 
There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes . 
`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? '' 
`` Yes , '' Mitya jerked out . 
`` That is , what blood ? 
... and why is the cuff turned in ? '' 
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory , and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin 's . 
`` You must take off your shirt , too . 
That 's very important as material evidence . '' 
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage . 
`` What , am I to stay naked ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Do n't disturb yourself . 
We will arrange something . 
And meanwhile take off your socks . '' 
`` You 're not joking ? 
Is that really necessary ? '' 
Mitya 's eyes flashed . 
`` We are in no mood for joking , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly . 
`` Well , if I must - '' muttered Mitya , and sitting down on the bed , he took off his socks . 
He felt unbearably awkward . 
All were clothed , while he was naked , and strange to say , when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence , and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them , and that now they had a perfect right to despise him . 
`` When all are undressed , one is somehow not ashamed , but when one 's the only one undressed and everybody is looking , it 's degrading , '' he kept repeating to himself , again and again . 
`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . '' 
`` Well , am I to stay naked like this ? '' 
he added savagely . 
`` Yes , that ca n't be helped for the time ... . 
Kindly sit down here for a while . 
You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed , and I. . . 
I 'll see to all this . '' 
All the things were shown to the witnesses . 
The report of the search was drawn up , and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out , and the clothes were carried out after him . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out , too . 
Mitya was left alone with the peasants , who stood in silence , never taking their eyes off him . 
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt . 
Luckily he had them all in his trunk . 
You can keep your own socks and underclothes . '' 
Mitya flew into a passion . 
`` I wo n't have other people 's clothes ! '' 
he shouted menacingly , `` give me my own ! '' 
`` It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Give me my own . 
Damn Kalganov and his clothes , too ! '' 
It was a long time before they could persuade him . 
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down . 
They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled . 
`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before . 
He had an absurd nightmarish feeling , as though he were out of his mind . 
`` Well , what now ? 
Are you going to flog me ? 
That 's all that 's left for you , '' he said , clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor . 
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though he disdained to speak to him . 
`` He looked too closely at my socks , and turned them inside out on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were - the scoundrel ! '' 
`` Well , now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though in reply to Mitya 's question . 
`` Yes , '' said the prosecutor thoughtfully , as though reflecting on something . 
`` We 've done what we could in your interest , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on , `` but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you , we are , at the present moment - '' `` What is the stone in your ring ? '' 
Mitya interrupted suddenly , as though awakening from a reverie . 
He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it ! 
... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night ! 
... And should I have been like this on this night , and at this moment , sitting with you , could I have talked like this , could I have moved like this , could I have looked at you and at the world like this , if I had really been the murderer of my father , when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night - not from fear - oh , not simply from fear of your punishment ! 
The disgrace of it ! 
And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you , who see nothing and believe in nothing , blind moles and scoffers , and to tell you another nasty thing I 've done , another disgrace , even if that would save me from your accusation ! 
No , better Siberia ! 
The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door , he killed him , he robbed him . 
Who was he ? 
I 'm racking my brains and ca n't think who . 
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov , and that 's all I can tell you , and that 's enough , enough , leave me alone ... . 
Exile me , punish me , but do n't bother me any more . 
I 'll say no more . 
Call your witnesses ! '' 
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future . 
The prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking , observed , as though it were the most ordinary thing , with the most frigid and composed air : `` Oh , about the open door of which you spoke just now , we may as well inform you , by the way , now , of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us , that has been given us by Grigory , the old man you wounded . 
On his recovery , he clearly and emphatically stated , in reply to our questions , that when , on coming out to the steps , and hearing a noise in the garden , he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open , before he noticed you running , as you have told us already , in the dark from the open window where you saw your father , he , Grigory , glanced to the left , and , while noticing the open window , observed at the same time , much nearer to him , the door , standing wide open - that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden . 
I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door , though , of course , he did not see you do so with his own eyes , since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden , running towards the fence . '' 
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he yelled , in a sudden frenzy , `` it 's a barefaced lie . 
He could n't have seen the door open because it was shut . 
He 's lying ! '' 
`` I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement . 
He does not waver . 
He adheres to it . 
We 've cross-examined him several times . '' 
`` Precisely . 
I have cross-examined him several times , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly . 
`` It 's false , false ! 
It 's either an attempt to slander me , or the hallucination of a madman , '' Mitya still shouted . 
`` He 's simply raving , from loss of blood , from the wound . 
He must have fancied it when he came to ... . 
He 's raving . '' 
`` Yes , but he noticed the open door , not when he came to after his injuries , but before that , as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge . '' 
`` But it 's false , it 's false ! 
It ca n't be so ! 
He 's slandering me from spite ... . 
He could n't have seen it ... I did n't come from the door , '' gasped Mitya . 
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him impressively : `` Confront him with it . '' 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope , on which three seals still remained intact . 
The envelope was empty , and slit open at one end . 
Mitya stared at it with open eyes . 
`` It ... it must be that envelope of my father 's , the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there 's inscribed on it , allow me , ` For my little chicken ' ... yes - three thousand ! '' 
he shouted , `` do you see , three thousand , do you see ? '' 
`` Of course , we see . 
But we did n't find the money in it . 
It was empty , and lying on the floor by the bed , behind the screen . '' 
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck . 
`` Gentlemen , it 's Smerdyakov ! '' 
he shouted suddenly , at the top of his voice . 
`` It 's he who 's murdered him ! 
He 's robbed him ! 
No one else knew where the old man hid the envelope . 
It 's Smerdyakov , that 's clear , now ! '' 
`` But you , too , knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow . '' 
`` I never knew it . 
I 've never seen it . 
This is the first time I 've looked at it . 
I 'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov ... . 
He was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden , I did n't know ... '' Mitya was completely breathless . 
`` But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father 's pillow . 
You especially stated that it was under the pillow , so you must have known it . '' 
`` We 've got it written down , '' confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Nonsense ! 
It 's absurd ! 
I 'd no idea it was under the pillow . 
And perhaps it was n't under the pillow at all ... . 
It was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow . 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
Have you asked him where it was ? 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
That 's the chief point ... . 
And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself ... . 
I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow , and now you - Oh , you know how one says the wrong thing , without meaning it . 
No one knew but Smerdyakov , only Smerdyakov , and no one else ... . 
He did n't even tell me where it was ! 
But it 's his doing , his doing ; there 's no doubt about it , he murdered him , that 's as clear as daylight now , '' Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically , repeating himself incoherently , and growing more and more exasperated and excited . 
`` You must understand that , and arrest him at once ... . 
He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious , that 's clear now ... . 
He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal , and without the signal father would never have opened the door ... '' `` But you 're again forgetting the circumstance , '' the prosecutor observed , still speaking with the same restraint , though with a note of triumph , `` that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there , while you were in the garden ... '' `` The door , the door , '' muttered Mitya , and he stared speechless at the prosecutor . 
He sank back helpless in his chair . 
All were silent . 
`` Yes , the door ! 
... It 's a nightmare ! 
God is against me ! '' 
he exclaimed , staring before him in complete stupefaction . 
`` Come , you see , '' the prosecutor went on with dignity , `` and you can judge for yourself , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
On the one hand , we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out , a fact which overwhelms you and us . 
On the other side , your incomprehensible , persistent , and , so to speak , obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands , when only three hours earlier , on your own showing , you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles ! 
In view of all these facts , judge for yourself . 
What are we to believe , and what can we depend upon ? 
And do n't accuse us of being ` frigid , cynical , scoffing people , ' who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart ... . 
Try to enter into our position ... '' Mitya was indescribably agitated . 
He turned pale . 
`` Very well ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly , `` I will tell you my secret . 
I 'll tell you where I got the money ! 
... I 'll reveal my shame , that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter . '' 
`` And believe me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch , in a voice of almost pathetic delight , `` that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may , later on , have an immense influence in your favour , and may , indeed , moreover - '' But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table , and he checked himself in time . 
Mitya , it is true , had not heard him . 
Mitya 's Great Secret Received with Hisses `` GENTLEMEN , '' he began , still in the same agitation , `` I want to make a full confession : that money was my own . '' 
The lawyer 's faces lengthened . 
That was not at all what they expected . 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` when at five o'clock on the same day , from your own confession - '' `` Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession ! 
That 's nothing to do with it now ! 
That money was my own , my own , that is , stolen by me ... not mine , I mean , but stolen by me , and it was fifteen hundred roubles , and I had it on me all the time , all the time ... '' `` But where did you get it ? '' 
`` I took it off my neck , gentlemen , off this very neck ... it was here , round my neck , sewn up in a rag , and I 'd had it round my neck a long time , it 's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace ! '' 
`` And from whom did you ... appropriate it ? '' 
`` You mean , ` steal it ' ? 
Speak out plainly now . 
Yes , I consider that I practically stole it , but , if you prefer , I ` appropriated it . ' 
I consider I stole it . 
And last night I stole it finally . '' 
`` Last night ? 
But you said that it 's a month since you ... obtained it ? 
... '' `` Yes . 
But not from my father . 
Not from my father , do n't be uneasy . 
I did n't steal it from my father , but from her . 
Let me tell you without interrupting . 
It 's hard to do , you know . 
You see , a month ago , I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna , formerly my betrothed . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` I know you know her . 
She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that . 
No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me . 
How 's that ? 
Why , when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand , not fifteen hundred , everybody knows that . '' 
`` Who knows it ? 
Who counted the money ? 
Did I let anyone count it ? '' 
`` Why , you told everyone yourself that you 'd spent exactly three thousand . '' 
`` It 's true , I did . 
I told the whole town so , and the whole town said so . 
And here , at Mokroe , too , everyone reckoned it was three thousand . 
Yet I did n't spend three thousand , but fifteen hundred . 
And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag . 
That 's how it was , gentlemen . 
That 's where I got that money yesterday ... '' `` This is almost miraculous , '' murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Allow me to inquire , '' observed the prosecutor at last , `` have you informed anyone whatever of this circumstance before ; I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago ? '' 
`` I told no one . '' 
`` That 's strange . 
Do you mean absolutely no one ? '' 
`` Absolutely no one . 
No one and nobody . '' 
`` What was your reason for this reticence ? 
What was your motive for making such a secret of it ? 
To be more precise : You have told us at last your secret , in your words , so ` disgraceful , ' though in reality - that is , of course , comparatively speaking - this action , that is , the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to someone else , and , of course , only for a time is , in my view at least , only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful , when one takes into consideration your character ... . 
Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable , still , discreditable is not ` disgraceful . ' 
... Many people have already guessed , during this last month , about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna 's that you have spent , and I heard the legend myself , apart from your confession ... . 
Mihail Makarovitch , for instance , had heard it , too , so that indeed , it was scarcely a legend , but the gossip of the whole town . 
There are indications , too , if I am not mistaken , that you confessed this yourself to someone , I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna 's , and so , it 's extremely surprising to me that hitherto , that is , up to the present moment , you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by , apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret ... . 
It 's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret ... . 
You cried out , just now , that Siberia would be better than confessing it ... '' The prosecutor ceased speaking . 
He was provoked . 
He did not conceal his vexation , which was almost anger , and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen , disconnectedly and incoherently , without choosing words . 
`` It 's not the fifteen hundred that 's the disgrace , but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand , '' said Mitya firmly . 
`` Why ? '' 
smiled the prosecutor irritably . 
`` What is there disgraceful , to your thinking , in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably , if you prefer , ` disgracefully , ' appropriated ? 
Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it . 
And by the way , why did you do that - why did you set apart that half , for what purpose , for what object did you do it ? 
Can you explain that to us ? '' 
`` Oh , gentlemen , the purpose is the whole point ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I put it aside because I was vile , that is , because I was calculating , and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month . '' 
`` It 's incomprehensible . '' 
`` I wonder at you . 
But I 'll make it clearer . 
Perhaps it really is incomprehensible . 
You see , attend to what I say . 
I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honour ; I spend it on a spree , say I spend it all , and next morning I go to her and say , ` Katya , I 've done wrong , I 've squandered your three thousand ' ; well , is that right ? 
No , it 's not right - it 's dishonest and cowardly ; I 'm a beast , with no more self-control than a beast , that 's so , is n't it ? 
But still I 'm not a thief ? 
Not a downright thief , you 'll admit ! 
I squandered it , but I did n't steal it . 
Now a second , rather more favourable alternative : follow me carefully , or I may get confused again - my head 's going round - and so , for the second alternative : I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand , that is , only half . 
Next day I go and take that half to her : ` Katya , take this fifteen hundred from me , I 'm a low beast , and an untrustworthy scoundrel , for I 've wasted half the money , and I shall waste this , too , so keep me from temptation ! ' 
Well , what of that alternative ? 
I should be a beast and a scoundrel , and whatever you like ; but not a thief , not altogether a thief , or I should not have brought back what was left , but have kept that , too . 
She would see at once that since I brought back half , I should pay back what I 'd spent , that I should never give up trying to , that I should work to get it and pay it back . 
So in that case I should be a scoundrel , but not a thief , you may say what you like , not a thief ! '' 
`` I admit that there is a certain distinction , '' said the prosecutor , with a cold smile . 
`` But it 's strange that you see such a vital difference . '' 
`` Yes , I see a vital difference . 
Every man may be a scoundrel , and perhaps every man is a scoundrel , but not everyone can be a thief ; it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that . 
Oh , of course , I do n't know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel , that 's my conviction . 
Listen , I carry the money about me a whole month ; I may make up my mind to give it back to-morrow , and I 'm a scoundrel no longer ; but I can not make up my mind , you see , though I 'm making up my mind every day , and every day spurring myself on to do it , and yet for a whole month I ca n't bring myself to it , you see . 
Is that right to your thinking , is that right ? '' 
`` Certainly , that 's not right ; that I can quite understand , and that I do n't dispute , '' answered the prosecutor with reserve . 
`` And let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions , and , if you will be so kind , get back to the point . 
And the point is , that you have still not told us , although we 've asked you , why , in the first place , you halved the money , squandering one half and hiding the other ? 
For what purpose exactly did you hide it , what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred ? 
I insist upon that question , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Yes , of course ! '' 
cried Mitya , striking himself on the forehead ; `` forgive me , I 'm worrying you , and am not explaining the chief point , or you 'd understand in a minute , for it 's just the motive of it that 's the disgrace ! 
You see , it was all to do with the old man , my dead father . 
He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous ; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him . 
So I kept thinking everyday , suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden , suppose she were to leave off tormenting me , and were suddenly to say to me , ' I love you , not him ; take me to the other end of the world . ' 
And I 'd only forty copecks ; how could I take her away , what could I do ? 
Why , I 'd be lost . 
You see , I did n't know her then , I did n't understand her , I thought she wanted money , and that she would n't forgive my poverty . 
And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand , sewed it up , calculating on it , sewed it up before I was drunk , and after I had sewn it up , I went off to get drunk on the rest . 
Yes , that was base . 
Do you understand now ? '' 
Both the lawyers laughed aloud . 
`` I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all , '' chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` for after all what does it amount to ? '' 
`` Why , that I stole it , that 's what it amounts to ! 
Oh , God , you horrify me by not understanding ! 
Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck , every day and every hour I said to myself , ` You 're a thief ! 
you 're a thief ! ' 
Yes , that 's why I 've been so savage all this month , that 's why I fought in the tavern , that 's why I attacked my father , it was because I felt I was a thief . 
I could n't make up my mind ; I did n't dare even to tell Alyosha , my brother , about that fifteen hundred : I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket . 
But , do you know , while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour : ` No , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you may yet not be a thief . ' 
Why ? 
Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya . 
And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck , on my way from Fenya 's to Perhotin . 
I had n't been able till that moment to bring myself to it . 
And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief , a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life . 
Why ? 
Because , with that I destroyed , too , my dream of going to Katya and saying , ` I 'm a scoundrel , but not a thief ! 
Do you understand now ? 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` What was it made you decide to do it yesterday ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch interrupted . 
`` Why ? 
It 's absurd to ask . 
Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning , here , at dawn . 
I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honour . 
But I see it 's not so , it turns out that it does make a difference . 
Believe me , gentlemen , what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I 'd killed the old servant , and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded , and Heaven was open to me again . 
Oh , that did torture me , but not in the same way ; not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it , and had become a downright thief ! 
Oh , gentlemen , I tell you again , with a bleeding heart , I have learnt a great deal this night . 
I have learnt that it 's not only impossible to live a scoundrel , but impossible to die a scoundrel ... . 
No , gentlemen , one must die honest ... '' Mitya was pale . 
His face had a haggard and exhausted look , in spite of his being intensely excited . 
`` I am beginning to understand you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor said slowly , a soft and almost compassionate tone . 
`` But all this , if you 'll excuse my saying so , is a matter of nerves , in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves , that 's what it is . 
And why , for instance , should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month , by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you ? 
And why could you not have explained things to her , and in view of your position , which you describe as being so awful , why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one 's mind , that is , after honourably confessing your errors to her , why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses , which , with her generous heart , she would certainly not have refused you in your distress , especially if it had been with some guarantee , or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov , and to Madame Hohlakov ? 
I suppose you still regard that security as of value ? '' 
Mitya suddenly crimsoned . 
`` Surely you do n't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that ? 
You ca n't be speaking in earnest ? '' 
he said , with indignation , looking the prosecutor straight in the face , and seeming unable to believe his ears . 
`` I assure you I 'm in earnest ... Why do you imagine I 'm not serious ? '' 
It was the prosecutor 's turn to be surprised . 
`` Oh , how base that would have been ! 
Gentlemen , do you know , you are torturing me ! 
Let me tell you everything , so be it . 
I 'll confess all my infernal wickedness , but to put you to shame , and you 'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink . 
You must know that I already had that plan myself , that plan you spoke of , just now , prosecutor ! 
Yes , gentlemen , I , too , have had that thought in my mind all this current month , so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya - I was mean enough for that . 
But to go to her , to tell her of my treachery , and for that very treachery , to carry it out , for the expenses of that treachery , to beg for money from her , Katya -LRB- to beg , do you hear , to beg -RRB- , and go straight from her to run away with the other , the rival , who hated and insulted her - to think of it ! 
You must be mad , prosecutor ! '' 
`` Mad I am not , but I did speak in haste , without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case , as you assert ... yes , perhaps there is something of the kind , '' said the prosecutor , smiling . 
`` But that would have been so infamous ! '' 
Mitya brought his fist down on the table fiercely . 
`` That would have been filthy beyond everything ! 
Yes , do you know that she might have given me that money , yes , and she would have given it , too ; she 'd have been certain to give it , to be revenged on me , she 'd have given it to satisfy her vengeance , to show her contempt for me , for hers is an infernal nature , too , and she 's a woman of great wrath . 
I 'd have taken the money , too , oh , I should have taken it ; I should have taken it , and then , for the rest of my life ... oh , God ! 
Forgive me , gentlemen , I 'm making such an outcry because I 've had that thought in my mind so lately , only the day before yesterday , that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy , and afterwards yesterday , all day yesterday , I remember , till that happened ... '' `` Till what happened ? '' 
put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively , but Mitya did not hear it . 
`` I have made you an awful confession , '' Mitya said gloomily in conclusion . 
`` You must appreciate it , and what 's more , you must respect it , for if not , if that leaves your souls untouched , then you 've simply no respect for me , gentlemen , I tell you that , and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you ! 
Oh , I shall shoot myself ! 
Yes , I see , I see already that you do n't believe me . 
What , you want to write that down , too ? '' 
he cried in dismay . 
`` Yes , what you said just now , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , looking at him surprise , `` that is , that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her ... . 
I assure you , that 's a very important piece of evidence for us , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you , particularly important for you . '' 
`` Have mercy , gentlemen ! '' 
Mitya flung up his hands . 
`` Do n't write that , anyway ; have some shame . 
Here I 've torn my heart asunder before you , and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves ... . 
Oh , my God ! '' 
In despair he hid his face in his hands . 
`` Do n't worry yourself so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' observed the prosecutor , `` everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards , and what you do n't agree to we 'll alter as you like . 
But now I 'll ask you one little question for the second time . 
Has no one , absolutely no one , heard from you of that money you sewed up ? 
That , I must tell you , is almost impossible to believe . '' 
`` No one , no one , I told you so before , or you 've not understood anything ! 
Let me alone ! '' 
`` Very well , this matter is bound to be explained , and there 's plenty of time for it , but meantime , consider ; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad , and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you 'd spent here ; three thousand , not fifteen hundred . 
And now , too , when you got hold of the money you had yesterday , you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you . '' 
`` You 've got not dozens , but hundreds of witnesses , two hundred witnesses , two hundred have heard it , thousands have heard it ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Well , you see , all bear witness to it . 
And the word all means something . '' 
`` It means nothing . 
I talked rot , and everyone began repeating it . '' 
`` But what need had you to ` talk rot , ' as you call it ? '' 
`` The devil knows . 
From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money ... . 
To try and forget that money I had sewn up , perhaps ... yes , that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question ? 
Well , I told a fib , and that was the end of it ; once I 'd said it , I did n't care to correct it . 
What does a man tell lies for sometimes ? '' 
`` That 's very difficult to decide , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what makes a man tell lies , '' observed the prosecutor impressively . 
`` Tell me , though , was that ` amulet , ' as you call it , on your neck , a big thing ? '' 
`` No , not big . '' 
`` How big , for instance ? '' 
`` If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half , that would be the size . '' 
`` You 'd better show us the remains of it . 
You must have them somewhere . '' 
`` Damnation , what nonsense ! 
I do n't know where they are . '' 
`` But excuse me : where and when did you take it off your neck ? 
According to your own evidence you did n't go home . '' 
`` When I was going from Fenya 's to Perhotin 's , on the way I tore it off my neck and took out the money . '' 
`` In the dark ? '' 
`` What should I want a light for ? 
I did it with my fingers in one minute . '' 
`` Without scissors , in the street ? '' 
`` In the market-place I think it was . 
Why scissors ? 
It was an old rag . 
It was torn in a minute . '' 
`` Where did you put it afterwards ? '' 
`` I dropped it there . '' 
`` Where was it , exactly ? '' 
`` In the market-place , in the market-place ! 
The devil knows whereabouts . 
What do you want to know for ? '' 
`` That 's extremely important , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
It would be material evidence in your favour . 
How is it you do n't understand that ? 
Who helped you to sew it up a month ago ? '' 
`` No one helped me . 
I did it myself . '' 
`` Can you sew ? '' 
`` A soldier has to know how to sew . 
No knowledge was needed to do that . '' 
`` Where did you get the material , that is , the rag in which you sewed the money ? '' 
`` Are you laughing at me ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
And we are in no mood for laughing , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` I do n't know where I got the rag from - somewhere , I suppose . '' 
`` I should have thought you could n't have forgotten it ? '' 
`` Upon my word , I do n't remember . 
I might have torn a bit off my linen . '' 
`` That 's very interesting . 
We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag . 
What sort of rag was it , cloth or linen ? '' 
`` Goodness only knows what it was . 
Wait a bit ... I believe I did n't tear it off anything . 
It was a bit of calico ... . 
I believe I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady 's . '' 
`` In your landlady 's cap ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I took it from her . '' 
`` How did you get it ? '' 
`` You see , I remember once taking a cap for a rag , perhaps to wipe my pen on . 
I took it without asking , because it was a worthless rag . 
I tore it up , and I took the notes and sewed them up in it . 
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them . 
An old piece of calico , washed a thousand times . '' 
`` And you remember that for certain now ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether for certain . 
I think it was in the cap . 
But , hang it , what does it matter ? '' 
`` In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost ? '' 
`` No , she wo n't , she did n't miss it . 
It was an old rag , I tell you , an old rag not worth a farthing . '' 
`` And where did you get the needle and thread ? '' 
`` I 'll stop now . 
I wo n't say any more . 
Enough of it ! '' 
said Mitya , losing his temper at last . 
`` It 's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place . '' 
`` Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow , and perhaps you 'll find it , '' said Mitya sneering . 
`` Enough , gentlemen , enough ! '' 
he decided , in an exhausted voice . 
`` I see you do n't believe me ! 
Not for a moment ! 
It 's my fault , not yours . 
I ought not to have been so ready . 
Why , why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you ? 
it 's a joke to you . 
I see that from your eyes . 
You led me on to it , prosecutor ! 
Sing a hymn of triumph if you can ... . 
Damn you , you torturers ! '' 
He bent his head , and hid his face in his hands . 
The lawyers were silent . 
A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly . 
His face now expressed complete , hopeless despair , and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening . 
In the meantime they had to finish what they were about . 
They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses . 
It was by now eight o'clock in the morning . 
The lights had been extinguished long ago . 
Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov , who had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had been going on , had now both gone out again . 
The lawyers , too , looked very tired . 
It was a wretched morning , the whole sky was overcast , and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls . 
Mitya gazed blankly out of window . 
`` May I look out of window ? '' 
he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly . 
`` Oh , as much as you like , '' the latter replied . 
Mitya got up and went to the window ... . 
The rain lashed against its little greenish panes . 
He could see the muddy road just below the house , and farther away , in the rain and mist , a row of poor , black , dismal huts , looking even blacker and poorer in the rain . 
Mitya thought of `` Phoebus the golden-haired , and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray . 
`` Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this , '' he thought with a smile , and suddenly , flinging his hand downwards , he turned to his `` torturers . '' 
`` Gentlemen , '' he cried , `` I see that I am lost ! 
But she ? 
Tell me about her , I beseech you . 
Surely she need not be ruined with me ? 
She 's innocent , you know , she was out of her mind when she cried last night ` It 's all my fault ! ' 
She 's done nothing , nothing ! 
I 've been grieving over her all night as I sat with you ... . 
Ca n't you , wo n't you tell me what you are going to do with her now ? '' 
`` You can set your mind quite at rest on that score , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor answered at once , with evident alacrity . 
`` We have , so far , no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested . 
I trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case ... . 
On the contrary , we 'll do everything that lies in our power in that matter . 
Set your mind completely at rest . '' 
`` Gentlemen , I thank you . 
I knew that you were honest , straightforward people in spite of everything . 
You 've taken a load off my heart ... . 
Well , what are we to do now ? 
I 'm ready . '' 
`` Well , we ought to make haste . 
We must pass to examining the witnesses without delay . 
That must be done in your presence and therefore - '' `` Should n't we have some tea first ? '' 
interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` I think we 've deserved it ! '' 
They decided that if tea were ready downstairs -LRB- Mihail Makarovitch had , no doubt , gone down to get some -RRB- they would have a glass and then `` go on and on , '' putting off their proper breakfast until a more favourable opportunity . 
Tea really was ready below , and was soon brought up . 
Mitya at first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him , but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily . 
He looked surprisingly exhausted . 
It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength that one night of carousing , even accompanied by the most violent emotions , could have had little effect on him . 
But he felt that he could hardly hold his head up , and from time to time all the objects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes . 
`` A little more and I shall begin raving , '' he said to himself . 
The Evidences of the Witnesses . 
The Babe THE examination of the witnesses began . 
But we will not continue our story in such detail as before . 
And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and conscience , and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath , how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence , and so on . 
We will only note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles ; that is , was the sum spent here , at Mokroe , by Mitya on the first occasion , a month before , three thousand or fifteen hundred ? 
And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen hundred yesterday ? 
Alas , all the evidence given by everyone turned out to be against Mitya . 
There was not one in his favour , and some witnesses introduced new , almost crushing facts , in contradiction of his , Mitya 's , story . 
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch . 
He was not in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers . 
He had , on the contrary , an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused , which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity . 
He spoke little , and with reserve , waited to be questioned , answered precisely and deliberately . 
Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than three thousand , that all the peasants about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself . 
`` What a lot of money he flung away on the Gypsy girls alone ! 
He wasted a thousand , I daresay , on them alone . '' 
`` I do n't believe I gave them five hundred , '' was Mitya 's gloomy comment on this . 
`` It 's a pity I did n't count the money at the time , but I was drunk ... '' Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains . 
He listened gloomily , with a melancholy and exhausted air , as though he would say : `` Oh , say what you like . 
It makes no difference now . '' 
`` More than a thousand went on them , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly . 
`` You flung it about at random and they picked it up . 
They were a rascally , thievish lot , horse-stealers , they 've been driven away from here , or maybe they 'd bear witness themselves how much they got from you . 
I saw the sum in your hands , myself - count it I did n't , you did n't let me , that 's true enough - but by the look of it I should say it was far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred , indeed ! 
We 've seen money too . 
We can judge of amounts ... '' As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had told him , as soon as he arrived , that he had brought three thousand with him . 
`` Come now , is that so , Trifon Borissovitch ? '' 
replied Mitya . 
`` Surely I did n't declare so positively that I 'd brought three thousand ? '' 
`` You did say so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You said it before Andrey . 
Andrey himself is still here . 
Send for him . 
And in the hall , when you were treating the chorus , you shouted straight out that you would leave your sixth thousand here - that is , with what you spent before , we must understand . 
Stepan and Semyon heard it , and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov , too , was standing beside you at the time . 
Maybe he 'd remember it ... '' The evidence as to the `` sixth '' thousand made an extraordinary impression on the two lawyers . 
They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning ; three and three made six , three thousand then and three now made six , that was clear . 
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch , Stepan and Semyon , the driver Andrey , and Kalganov . 
The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch 's evidence . 
They noted down , with particular care , Andrey 's account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road : '' ` Where , ' says he , ` am I , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , going , to heaven or to hell , and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not ? ' '' 
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile , and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be `` included in the case . '' 
Kalganov , when called , came in reluctantly , frowning and ill-humoured , and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his life , though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day for a long time past . 
He began by saying that `` he knew nothing about it and did n't want to . '' 
But it appeared that he had heard of the '' sixth '' thousand , and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the moment . 
As far as he could see he `` did n't know '' how much money Mitya had in his hands . 
He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards . 
In reply to reiterated questions he stated that , after the Poles had been turned out , Mitya 's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved , and that she had said that she loved him . 
He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect , as though she had been a lady of the best society , and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka . 
In spite of the young man 's obvious repugnance at giving evidence , Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great length , and only from him learnt all the details of what made up Mitya 's `` romance , '' so to say , on that night . 
Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up . 
At last they let the young man go , and he left the room with unconcealed indignation . 
The Poles , too , were examined . 
Though they had gone to bed in their room , they had not slept all night , and on the arrival of the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready , realising that they would certainly be sent for . 
They gave their evidence with dignity , though not without some uneasiness . 
The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the twelfth class , who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon . 
His name was Mussyalovitch . 
Pan Vrubelvsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist . 
Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch , who was standing on one side , taking him in their ignorance for the most important person and in command , and addressed him at every word as `` Pan Colonel . '' 
Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself , they grasped that they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only . 
It turned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words . 
Of his relations with Grushenka , past and present , Pan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly , so that Mitya was roused at once and declared that he would not allow the `` scoundrel '' to speak like that in his presence ! 
Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the word `` scoundrel , '' and begged that it should be put down in the protocol . 
Mitya fumed with rage . 
`` He 's a scoundrel ! 
A scoundrel ! 
You can put that down . 
And put down , too , that , in spite of the protocol I still declare that he 's a scoundrel ! '' 
he cried . 
Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol , he showed the most praiseworthy tact and management . 
After sternly reprimanding Mitya , he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case , and hastened to pass to what was essential . 
One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special interest in the lawyers : that was how , in that very room , Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch , and had offered him three thousand roubles to resign his claims , seven hundred roubles down , and the remaining two thousand three hundred `` to be paid next day in the town . '' 
He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at Mokroe , but that his money was in the town . 
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in the town . 
But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement , and Mitya , after thinking for a moment admitted , frowning , that it must have been as the Poles stated , that he had been excited at the time , and might indeed have said so . 
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence . 
It seemed to establish for the prosecution -LRB- and they did , in fact , base this deduction on it -RRB- that half , or a part of , the three thousand that had come into Mitya 's hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town , or even , perhaps , somewhere here , in Mokroe . 
This would explain the circumstance , so baffling for the prosecution , that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya 's hands . 
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which , insignificant as it was , had hitherto told , to some extent , in Mitya 's favour . 
Now this one piece of evidence in his favour had broken down . 
In answer to the prosecutor 's inquiry , where he would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles , since he himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred , Mitya confidently replied that he had meant to offer the `` little chap , '' not money , but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya , those rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov . 
The prosecutor positively smiled at the `` innocence of this subterfuge . '' 
`` And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash ? '' 
`` He certainly would have accepted it , '' Mitya declared warmly . 
`` Why , look here , he might have grabbed not two thousand , but four or six , for it . 
He would have put his lawyers , Poles and Jews , on to the job , and might have got , not three thousand , but the whole property out of the old man . '' 
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was , of course , entered in the protocol in the fullest detail . 
Then they let the Poles go . 
The incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them , as it was , and did not want to worry them with trifles , moreover , it was nothing but a foolish , drunken quarrel over cards . 
There had been drinking and disorder enough , that night ... . 
So the two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles . 
Then old Maximov was summoned . 
He came in timidly , approached with little steps , looking very dishevelled and depressed . 
He had , all this time , taken refuge below with Grushenka , sitting dumbly beside her , and `` now and then he 'd begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief , '' as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards . 
So that she herself began trying to pacify and comfort him . 
The old man at once confessed that he had done wrong , that he had borrowed `` ten roubles in my poverty , '' from Dmitri Fyodorovitch , and that he was ready to pay it back . 
To Nikolay Parfenovitch 's direct question , had he noticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand , as he must have been able to see the sum better than anyone when he took the note from him , Maximov , in the most positive manner , declared that there was twenty thousand . 
`` Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before , then ? '' 
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch , with a smile . 
`` To be sure I have , not twenty , but seven , when my wife mortgaged my little property . 
She 'd only let me look at it from a distance , boasting of it to me . 
It was a very thick bundle , all rainbow-coloured notes . 
And Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's were all rainbow-coloured ... '' He was not kept long . 
At last it was Grushenka 's turn . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might have on Mitya , and he muttered a few words of admonition to him , but Mitya bowed his head in silence , giving him to understand `` that he would not make a scene . '' 
Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in . 
She entered with a stern and gloomy face , that looked almost composed , and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
She was very pale , she seemed to be cold , and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl . 
She was suffering from a slight feverish chill - the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night . 
Her grave air , her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favourable impression on everyone . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit `` fascinated . '' 
He admitted himself , when talking about it afterwards , that only then had he seen `` how handsome the woman was , '' for , though he had seen her several times he had always looked upon her as something of a `` provincial hetaira . '' 
`` She has the manners of the best society , '' he said enthusiastically , gossiping about her in a circle of ladies . 
But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies , who immediately called him a `` naughty man , '' to his great satisfaction . 
As she entered the room , Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya , who looked at her uneasily . 
But her face reassured him at once . 
After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings , Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her , hesitating a little , but preserving the most courteous manner , on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied : `` He was an acquaintance . 
He came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month . '' 
To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness , that , though `` at times '' she had thought him attractive , she had not loved him , but had won his heart as well as his old father 's `` in my nasty spite , '' that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and everyone else ; but that had only amused her . 
She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch , she had simply been laughing at him . 
`` I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month . 
I was expecting another man who had wronged me . 
But I think , '' she said in conclusion , `` that there 's no need for you to inquire about that , nor for me to answer you , for that 's my own affair . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint . 
He again dismissed the `` romantic '' aspect of the case and passed to the serious one , that is , to the question of most importance , concerning the three thousand roubles . 
Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe , and , though she had not counted the money herself , she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's own lips . 
`` Did he tell you that alone , or before someone else , or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence ? '' 
the prosecutor inquired immediately . 
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people , and had heard him say so when they were alone . 
`` Did he say it to you alone once , or several times ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor , and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence . 
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew , too , where that money had come from , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` And did you never , once , hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand , but less , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use ? '' 
`` No , I never heard that , '' answered Grushenka . 
It was explained further that Mitya had , on the contrary , often told her that he had n't a farthing . 
`` He was always expecting to get some from his father , '' said Grushenka in conclusion . 
`` Did he never say before you ... casually , or in a moment of irritation , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly , `` that he intended to make an attempt on his father 's life ? '' 
`` Ach , he did say so , '' sighed Grushenka . 
`` Once or several times ? '' 
`` He mentioned it several times , always in anger . '' 
`` And did you believe he would do it ? '' 
`` No , I never believed it , '' she answered firmly . 
`` I had faith in his noble heart . '' 
`` Gentlemen , allow me , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna , in your presence . '' 
`` You can speak , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch assented . 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ! '' 
Mitya got up from his chair , `` have faith in God and in me . 
I am not guilty of my father 's murder ! '' 
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair . 
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon . 
`` Thanks be to Thee , O Lord , '' she said , in a voice thrilled with emotion , and still standing , she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added : `` As he has spoken now , believe it ! 
I know him . 
He 'll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy , but he 'll never deceive you against his conscience . 
He 's telling the whole truth , you may believe it . '' 
`` Thanks , Agrafena Alexandrovna , you 've given me fresh courage , '' Mitya responded in a quivering voice . 
As to the money spent the previous day , she declared that she did not know what sum it was , but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him . 
And to the question where he got the money , she said that he had told her that he had `` stolen '' it from Katerina Ivanovna , and that she had replied to that that he had n't stolen it , and that he must pay the money back next day . 
On the prosecutor 's asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday , or what he had squandered here a month ago , she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago , and that that was how she understood him . 
Grushenka was at last released , and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could be of any assistance to her , with horses for example , or if she would care for an escort , he ... would be - `` I thank you sincerely , '' said Grushenka , bowing to him , `` I 'm going with this old gentleman ; I am driving him back to town with me , and meanwhile , if you 'll allow me , I 'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
She went out . 
Mitya was calm , and even looked more cheerful , but only for a moment . 
He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness . 
His eyes were closing with fatigue . 
The examination of the witnesses was , at last , over . 
They procceded to a revision of the protocol . 
Mitya got up , moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain , lay down on a large chest covered with a rug , and instantly fell asleep . 
He had a strange dream , utterly out of keeping with the place and the time . 
He was driving somewhere in the steppes , where he had been stationed long ago , and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses , through snow and sleet . 
He was cold , it was early in November , and the snow was falling in big wet flakes , melting as soon as it touched the earth . 
And the peasant drove him smartly , he had a fair , long beard . 
He was not an old man , somewhere about fifty , and he had on a grey peasant 's smock . 
Not far off was a village , he could see the black huts , and half the huts were burnt down , there were only the charred beams sticking up . 
And as they drove in , there were peasant women drawn up along the road , a lot of women , a whole row , all thin and wan , with their faces a sort of brownish colour , especially one at the edge , a tall , bony woman , who looked forty , but might have been only twenty , with a long thin face . 
And in her arms was a little baby crying . 
And her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them . 
And the child cried and cried , and held out its little bare arms , with its little fists blue from cold . 
`` Why are they crying ? 
Why are they crying ? '' 
Mitya asked , as they dashed gaily by . 
`` It 's the babe , '' answered the driver , `` the babe weeping . '' 
And Mitya was struck by his saying , in his peasant way , `` the babe , '' and he liked the peasant 's calling it a `` babe . '' 
There seemed more pity in it . 
`` But why is it weeping ? '' 
Mitya persisted stupidly , `` why are its little arms bare ? 
Why do n't they wrap it up ? '' 
`` The babe 's cold , its little clothes are frozen and do n't warm it . '' 
`` But why is it ? 
Why ? '' 
foolish Mitya still persisted . 
`` Why , they 're poor people , burnt out . 
They 've no bread . 
They 're begging because they 've been burnt out . '' 
`` No , no , '' Mitya , as it were , still did not understand . 
`` Tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there ? 
Why are people poor ? 
Why is the babe poor ? 
Why is the steppe barren ? 
Why do n't they hug each other and kiss ? 
Why do n't they sing songs of joy ? 
Why are they so dark from black misery ? 
Why do n't they feed the babe ? '' 
And he felt that , though his questions were unreasonable and senseless , yet he wanted to ask just that , and he had to ask it just in that way . 
And he felt that a passion of pity , such as he had never known before , was rising in his heart , that he wanted to cry , that he wanted to do something for them all , so that the babe should weep no more , so that the dark-faced , dried-up mother should not weep , that no one should shed tears again from that moment , and he wanted to do it at once , at once , regardless of all obstacles , with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs . 
`` And I 'm coming with you . 
I wo n't leave you now for the rest of my life , I 'm coming with you '' , he heard close beside him Grushenka 's tender voice , thrilling with emotion . 
And his heart glowed , and he struggled forward towards the light , and he longed to live , to live , to go on and on , towards the new , beckoning light , and to hasten , hasten , now , at once ! 
`` What ! 
Where ? '' 
he exclaimed opening his eyes , and sitting up on the chest , as though he had revived from a swoon , smiling brightly . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was standing over him , suggesting that he should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it . 
Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an hour or more , but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
He was suddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head , which had n't been there when he had leant back , exhausted , on the chest . 
`` Who put that pillow under my head ? 
Who was so kind ? '' 
he cried , with a sort of ecstatic gratitude , and tears in his voice , as though some great kindness had been shown him . 
He never found out who this kind man was ; perhaps one of the peasant witnesses , or Nikolay Parfenovitch 's little secretary , had compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head ; but his whole soul was quivering with tears . 
He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they liked . 
`` I 've had a good dream , gentlemen , '' he said in a strange voice , with a new light , as of joy , in his face . 
They Carry Mitya Away WHEN the protocol had been signed , Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him the `` Committal , '' setting forth , that in such a year , on such a day , in such a place , the investigating lawyer of such-and-such a district court , having examined so-and-so -LRB- to wit , Mitya -RRB- accused of this and of that -LRB- all the charges were carefully written out -RRB- and having considered that the accused , not pleading guilty to the charges made against him , had brought forward nothing in his defence , while the witnesses , so-and-so , and so-and-so , and the circumstances such-and-such testify against him , acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of the Statute Book , and so on , has ruled , that , in order to preclude so-and-so -LRB- Mitya -RRB- from all means of evading pursuit and judgment , he be detained in such-and-such a prison , which he hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same `` Committal '' to the deputy prosecutor , and so on , and so on . 
In brief , Mitya was informed that he was , from that moment , a prisoner , and that he would be driven at once to the town , and there shut up in a very unpleasant place . 
Mitya listened attentively , and only shrugged his shoulders . 
`` Well , gentlemen , I do n't blame you . 
I 'm ready ... . 
I understand that there 's nothing else for you to do . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at once by the rural police officer , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , who happened to be on the spot ... `` Stay , '' Mitya interrupted , suddenly , and impelled by uncontrollable feeling he pronounced , addressing all in the room : `` Gentlemen , we 're all cruel , we 're all monsters , we all make men weep , and mothers , and babes at the breast , but of all , let it be settled here , now , of all I am the lowest reptile ! 
I 've sworn to amend , and every day I 've done the same filthy things . 
I understand now that such men as I need a blow , a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose , and bind them by a force from without . 
Never , never should I have risen of myself ! 
But the thunderbolt has fallen . 
I accept the torture of accusation , and my public shame ; I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified . 
Perhaps I shall be purified , gentlemen ? 
But listen , for the last time , I am not guilty of my father 's blood . 
I accept my punishment , not because I killed him , but because I meant to kill him , and perhaps I really might have killed him . 
Still I mean to fight it out with you . 
I warn you of that . 
I 'll fight it out with you to the end , and then God will decide . 
Good-bye , gentlemen , do n't be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the examination . 
Oh , I was still such a fool then ... . 
In another minute I shall be a prisoner , but now , for the last time , as a free man , Dmitri Karamazov offers you his hand . 
Saying good-bye to you , I say it to all men . '' 
His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand , but Nikolay Parfenovitch , who happened to stand nearest to him , with a sudden , almost nervous movement , hid his hands behind his back . 
Mitya instantly noticed this , and started . 
He let his outstretched hand fall at once . 
`` The preliminary inquiry is not yet over , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered , somewhat embarrassed . 
`` We will continue it in the town , and I , for my part , of course , am ready to wish you all success ... in your defence ... . 
As a matter of fact , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I 've always been disposed to regard you as , so to speak , more unfortunate than guilty . 
All of us here , if I may make bold to speak for all , we are all ready to recognise that you are , at bottom , a young man of honour , but , alas , one who has been carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch 's little figure was positively majestic by the time he had finished speaking . 
It struck Mitya that in another minute this `` boy '' would take his arm , lead him to another corner , and renew their conversation about `` girls . '' 
But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to execution . 
`` Gentlemen , you are good , you are humane , may I see her to say ` good-bye ' for the last time ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` Certainly , but considering ... in fact , now it 's impossible except in the presence of - '' `` Oh , well , if it must be so , it must ! '' 
Grushenka was brought in , but the farewell was brief , and of few words , and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Grushenka made a deep bow to Mitya . 
`` I have told you I am yours , and I will be yours . 
I will follow you for ever , wherever they may send you . 
Farewell ; you are guiltless , though you 've been your own undoing . '' 
Her lips quivered , tears flowed from her eyes . 
`` Forgive me , Grusha , for my love , for ruining you , too , with my love . '' 
Mitya would have said something more , but he broke off and went out . 
He was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him . 
At the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day before with Andrey 's three horses , two carts stood in readiness . 
Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , a sturdy , thick-set man with a wrinkled face , was annoyed about something , some sudden irregularity . 
He was shouting angrily . 
He asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness . 
`` When I stood him drinks in the tavern , the man had quite a different face , '' thought Mitya , as he got in . 
At the gates there was a crowd of people , peasants , women , and drivers . 
Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too . 
All stared at Mitya . 
`` Forgive me at parting , good people ! '' 
Mitya shouted suddenly from the cart . 
`` Forgive us too ! '' 
he heard two or three voices . 
`` Good-bye to you , too , Trifon Borissovitch ! '' 
But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round . 
He was , perhaps , too busy . 
He , too , was shouting and fussing about something . 
It appeared that everything was not yet ready in the second cart , in which two constables were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
The peasant who had been ordered to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock , stoutly maintaining that it was not his turn to go , but Akim 's . 
But Akim was not to be seen . 
They ran to look for him . 
The peasant persisted and besought them to wait . 
`` You see what our peasants are , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
They 've no shame ! '' 
exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch . 
`` Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the day before yesterday . 
You 've drunk it all and now you cry out . 
I 'm simply surprised at your good-nature , with our low peasants , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , that 's all I can say . '' 
`` But what do we want a second cart for ? '' 
Mitya put in . 
`` Let 's start with the one , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
I wo n't be unruly , I wo n't run away from you , old fellow . 
What do we want an escort for ? '' 
`` I 'll trouble you , sir , to learn how to speak to me if you 've never been taught .
