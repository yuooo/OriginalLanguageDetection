One day , her butcher , who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean , said to her : `` That 's a queer fish . '' 
She replied : `` He 's a saint . '' 
Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the Rue de Babylone . 
Unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet . 
That gate was always closed . 
Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated , in order not to attract attention . 
In this , possibly , he made a mistake . 
FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming . 
The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it , without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths . 
More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient , padlocked gate , twisted , tottering , fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars , and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque . 
There was a stone bench in one corner , one or two mouldy statues , several lattices which had lost their nails with time , were rotting on the wall , and there were no walks nor turf ; but there was enough grass everywhere . 
Gardening had taken its departure , and nature had returned . 
Weeds abounded , which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land . 
The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid . 
Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life ; venerable growth reigned there among them . 
The trees had bent over towards the nettles , the plant had sprung upward , the branch had inclined , that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air , that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss ; trunks , boughs , leaves , fibres , clusters , tendrils , shoots , spines , thorns , had mingled , crossed , married , confounded themselves in each other ; vegetation in a deep and close embrace , had celebrated and accomplished there , under the well-pleased eye of the Creator , in that enclosure three hundred feet square , the holy mystery of fraternity , symbol of the human fraternity . 
This garden was no longer a garden , it was a colossal thicket , that is to say , something as impenetrable as a forest , as peopled as a city , quivering like a nest , sombre like a cathedral , fragrant like a bouquet , solitary as a tomb , living as a throng . 
In Floreal -LSB- 34 -RSB- this enormous thicket , free behind its gate and within its four walls , entered upon the secret labor of germination , quivered in the rising sun , almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love , and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins , and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks , sprinkled on the damp earth , on the defaced statues , on the crumbling steps of the pavilion , and even on the pavement of the deserted street , flowers like stars , dew like pearls , fecundity , beauty , life , joy , perfumes . 
At midday , a thousand white butterflies took refuge there , and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade . 
There , in those gay shadows of verdure , a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul , and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed . 
In the evening , a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it ; a shroud of mist , a calm and celestial sadness covered it ; the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it , like an exquisite and subtle poison ; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches ; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees ; by day the wings rejoice the leaves , by night the leaves protect the wings . 
-LSB- 34 -RSB- From April 19 to May 20 . 
In winter the thicket was black , dripping , bristling , shivering , and allowed some glimpse of the house . 
Instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers , the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold , thick carpet of yellow leaves ; but in any fashion , under any aspect , at all seasons , spring , winter , summer , autumn , this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy , contemplation , solitude , liberty , the absence of man , the presence of God ; and the rusty old gate had the air of saying : `` This garden belongs to me . '' 
It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side , the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces away , the dome of the Invalides close at hand , the Chamber of Deputies not far off ; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously , in vain , in the vicinity , in vain did the yellow , brown , white , and red omnibuses cross each other 's course at the neighboring cross-roads ; the Rue Plumet was the desert ; and the death of the former proprietors , the revolution which had passed over it , the crumbling away of ancient fortunes , absence , forgetfulness , forty years of abandonment and widowhood , had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns , mulleins , hemlock , yarrow , tall weeds , great crimped plants , with large leaves of pale green cloth , lizards , beetles , uneasy and rapid insects ; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur ; and for nature , which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man , and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all , in the ant as well as in the eagle , to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World . 
Nothing is small , in fact ; any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this . 
Although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy , either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect , the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity . 
Everything toils at everything . 
Algebra is applied to the clouds ; the radiation of the star profits the rose ; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations . 
Who , then , can calculate the course of a molecule ? 
How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand ? 
Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little , the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being , and the avalanches of creation ? 
The tiniest worm is of importance ; the great is little , the little is great ; everything is balanced in necessity ; alarming vision for the mind . 
There are marvellous relations between beings and things ; in that inexhaustible whole , from the sun to the grub , nothing despises the other ; all have need of each other . 
The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths , without knowing what it is doing ; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers . 
All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite . 
Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg , and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates . 
Where the telescope ends , the microscope begins . 
Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision ? 
Choose . 
A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers ; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars . 
The same promiscuousness , and yet more unprecedented , exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance . 
Elements and principles mingle , combine , wed , multiply with each other , to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness . 
The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself . 
In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities , rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia , employing everything , not losing a single dream , not a single slumber , sowing an animalcule here , crumbling to bits a planet there , oscillating and winding , making of light a force and of thought an element , disseminated and invisible , dissolving all , except that geometrical point , the I ; bringing everything back to the soul-atom ; expanding everything in God , entangling all activity , from summit to base , in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism , attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth , subordinating , who knows ? 
Were it only by the identity of the law , the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water . 
A machine made of mind . 
Enormous gearing , the prime motor of which is the gnat , and whose final wheel is the zodiac . 
CHANGE OF GATE It seemed that this garden , created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries , had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries . 
There were no longer either arbors , or bowling greens , or tunnels , or grottos ; there was a magnificent , dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all . 
Paphos had been made over into Eden . 
It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome . 
This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul . 
This coquettish garden , formerly decidedly compromised , had returned to virginity and modesty . 
A justice assisted by a gardener , a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon , and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lenotre , had turned it about , cut , ruffled , decked , moulded it to gallantry ; nature had taken possession of it once more , had filled it with shade , and had arranged it for love . 
There was , also , in this solitude , a heart which was quite ready . 
Love had only to show himself ; he had here a temple composed of verdure , grass , moss , the sight of birds , tender shadows , agitated branches , and a soul made of sweetness , of faith , of candor , of hope , of aspiration , and of illusion . 
Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child ; she was a little more than fourteen , and she was at the `` ungrateful age '' ; we have already said , that with the exception of her eyes , she was homely rather than pretty ; she had no ungraceful feature , but she was awkward , thin , timid and bold at once , a grown-up little girl , in short . 
Her education was finished , that is to say , she has been taught religion , and even and above all , devotion ; then `` history , '' that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents , geography , grammar , the participles , the kings of France , a little music , a little drawing , etc. ; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant , which is a great charm and a great peril . 
The soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later on , mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there , as in a dark chamber . 
She should be gently and discreetly enlightened , rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light . 
A useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls . 
There is nothing but the maternal instinct , that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman , which knows how this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist . 
Nothing supplies the place of this instinct . 
All the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl 's soul . 
Cosette had had no mother . 
She had only had many mothers , in the plural . 
As for Jean Valjean , he was , indeed , all tenderness , all solicitude ; but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all . 
Now , in this work of education , in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life , what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence ! 
Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent . 
The convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown . 
The heart , thus thrown back upon itself , works downward within itself , since it can not overflow , and grows deep , since it can not expand . 
Hence visions , suppositions , conjectures , outlines of romances , a desire for adventures , fantastic constructions , edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind , sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter . 
The convent is a compression which , in order to triumph over the human heart , should last during the whole life . 
On quitting the convent , Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet . 
It was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty ; a garden that was closed , but a nature that was acrid , rich , voluptuous , and fragrant ; the same dreams as in the convent , but with glimpses of young men ; a grating , but one that opened on the street . 
Still , when she arrived there , we repeat , she was only a child . 
Jean Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her . 
`` Do what you like with it , '' he said to her . 
This amused Cosette ; she turned over all the clumps and all the stones , she hunted for `` beasts '' ; she played in it , while awaiting the time when she would dream in it ; she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass , while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head . 
And then , she loved her father , that is to say , Jean Valjean , with all her soul , with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her . 
It will be remembered that M. Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal . 
Jean Valjean had continued this practice ; he had come to converse well ; he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself . 
He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness ; his mind was rough and his heart was soft . 
During their conversations in the Luxembourg , he gave her explanations of everything , drawing on what he had read , and also on what he had suffered . 
As she listened to him , Cosette 's eyes wandered vaguely about . 
This simple man sufficed for Cosette 's thought , the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes . 
When she had had a good chase after the butterflies , she came panting up to him and said : `` Ah ! 
How I have run ! '' 
He kissed her brow . 
Cosette adored the goodman . 
She was always at his heels . 
Where Jean Valjean was , there happiness was . 
Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden ; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard , than in the enclosure filled with flowers , and in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry , against which stood tufted easy-chairs . 
Jean Valjean sometimes said to her , smiling at his happiness in being importuned : `` Do go to your own quarters ! 
Leave me alone a little ! '' 
She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father . 
`` Father , I am very cold in your rooms ; why do n't you have a carpet here and a stove ? '' 
`` Dear child , there are so many people who are better than I and who have not even a roof over their heads . '' 
`` Then why is there a fire in my rooms , and everything that is needed ? '' 
`` Because you are a woman and a child . '' 
`` Bah ! 
must men be cold and feel uncomfortable ? '' 
`` Certain men . '' 
`` That is good , I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire . '' 
And again she said to him : -- `` Father , why do you eat horrible bread like that ? '' 
`` Because , my daughter . '' 
`` Well , if you eat it , I will eat it too . '' 
Then , in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread , Jean Valjean ate white bread . 
Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood . 
She prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known . 
The Thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream . 
She remembered that she had gone `` one day , at night , '' to fetch water in a forest . 
She thought that it had been very far from Paris . 
It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss , and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it . 
Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds , spiders , and serpents . 
When she meditated in the evening , before falling asleep , as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean 's daughter , and that he was her father , she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her . 
When he was seated , she leaned her cheek against his white hair , and dropped a silent tear , saying to herself : `` Perhaps this man is my mother . '' 
Cosette , although this is a strange statement to make , in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent , -- maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity , -- had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible . 
She did not even know her mother 's name . 
Whenever she asked Jean Valjean , Jean Valjean remained silent . 
If she repeated her question , he responded with a smile . 
Once she insisted ; the smile ended in a tear . 
This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness . 
Was it prudence ? 
Was it respect ? 
Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own ? 
So long as Cosette had been small , Jean Valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother ; when she became a young girl , it was impossible for him to do so . 
It seemed to him that he no longer dared . 
Was it because of Cosette ? 
Was it because of Fantine ? 
He felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette 's thought ; and of placing a third in their destiny . 
The more sacred this shade was to him , the more did it seem that it was to be feared . 
He thought of Fantine , and felt himself overwhelmed with silence . 
Through the darkness , he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips . 
Had all the modesty which had been in Fantine , and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime , returned to rest upon her after her death , to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman , and in its shyness , to keep her in her grave ? 
Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure ? 
We who believe in death , are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation . 
Hence the impossibility of uttering , even for Cosette , that name of Fantine . 
One day Cosette said to him : -- `` Father , I saw my mother in a dream last night . 
She had two big wings . 
My mother must have been almost a saint during her life . '' 
`` Through martyrdom , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
However , Jean Valjean was happy . 
When Cosette went out with him , she leaned on his arm , proud and happy , in the plenitude of her heart . 
Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight , at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive , so wholly satisfied with himself alone . 
The poor man trembled , inundated with angelic joy ; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives ; he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss , and he thanked God , in the depths of his soul , for having permitted him to be loved thus , he , a wretch , by that innocent being . 
THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR One day , Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror , and she said to herself : `` Really ! '' 
It seemed to her almost that she was pretty . 
This threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind . 
Up to that moment she had never thought of her face . 
She saw herself in her mirror , but she did not look at herself . 
And then , she had so often been told that she was homely ; Jean Valjean alone said gently : `` No indeed ! 
no indeed ! '' 
At all events , Cosette had always thought herself homely , and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood . 
And here , all at once , was her mirror saying to her , as Jean Valjean had said : `` No indeed ! '' 
That night , she did not sleep . 
`` What if I were pretty ! '' 
she thought . 
`` How odd it would be if I were pretty ! '' 
And she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent , and she said to herself : `` What ! 
Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So ? '' 
The next morning she looked at herself again , not by accident this time , and she was assailed with doubts : `` Where did I get such an idea ? '' 
said she ; `` no , I am ugly . '' 
She had not slept well , that was all , her eyes were sunken and she was pale . 
She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful , but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer . 
She did not look at herself again , and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror . 
In the evening , after dinner , she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing-room , and Jean Valjean read beside her . 
Once she raised her eyes from her work , and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her . 
On another occasion , she was passing along the street , and it seemed to her that some one behind her , whom she did not see , said : `` A pretty woman ! 
but badly dressed . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
she thought , `` he does not mean me . 
I am well dressed and ugly . '' 
She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown . 
At last , one day when she was in the garden , she heard poor old Toussaint saying : `` Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing , sir ? '' 
Cosette did not hear her father 's reply , but Toussaint 's words caused a sort of commotion within her . 
She fled from the garden , ran up to her room , flew to the looking-glass , -- it was three months since she had looked at herself , -- and gave vent to a cry . 
She had just dazzled herself . 
She was beautiful and lovely ; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint and her mirror . 
Her figure was formed , her skin had grown white , her hair was lustrous , an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes . 
The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant , like the sudden advent of daylight ; other people noticed it also , Toussaint had said so , it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken , there could no longer be any doubt of that ; she descended to the garden again , thinking herself a queen , imagining that she heard the birds singing , though it was winter , seeing the sky gilded , the sun among the trees , flowers in the thickets , distracted , wild , in inexpressible delight . 
Jean Valjean , on his side , experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart . 
In fact , he had , for some time past , been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette 's sweet face . 
The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him . 
Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself . 
But , from the very first day , that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl 's person , wounded Jean Valjean 's sombre eye . 
He felt that it was a change in a happy life , a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something . 
This man , who had passed through all manner of distresses , who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate , who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint , who , after having dragged the chain of the galleys , was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery , this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium , this man accepted all , excused all , pardoned all , and merely asked of Providence , of man , of the law , of society , of nature , of the world , one thing , that Cosette might love him ! 
That Cosette might continue to love him ! 
That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him , and from remaining with him ! 
Beloved by Cosette , he felt that he was healed , rested , appeased , loaded with benefits , recompensed , crowned . 
Beloved by Cosette , it was well with him ! 
He asked nothing more ! 
Had any one said to him : `` Do you want anything better ? '' 
he would have answered : `` No . '' 
God might have said to him : `` Do you desire heaven ? '' 
and he would have replied : `` I should lose by it . '' 
Everything which could affect this situation , if only on the surface , made him shudder like the beginning of something new . 
He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means ; but he understood instinctively , that it was something terrible . 
He gazed with terror on this beauty , which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him , beneath his very eyes , on the innocent and formidable brow of that child , from the depths of her homeliness , of his old age , of his misery , of his reprobation . 
He said to himself : `` How beautiful she is ! 
What is to become of me ? '' 
There , moreover , lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother . 
What he beheld with anguish , a mother would have gazed upon with joy . 
The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance . 
On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself : `` Decidedly I am beautiful ! '' 
Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet . 
She recalled the remark of that passer-by : `` Pretty , but badly dressed , '' the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished , after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined , later on , to fill the whole life of woman , coquetry . 
Love is the other . 
With faith in her beauty , the whole feminine soul expanded within her . 
She conceived a horror for her merinos , and shame for her plush hat . 
Her father had never refused her anything . 
She at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet , the gown , the mantle , the boot , the cuff , the stuff which is in fashion , the color which is becoming , that science which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming , so deep , and so dangerous . 
The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne . 
In less than a month , little Cosette , in that Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone , was not only one of the prettiest , but one of the `` best dressed '' women in Paris , which means a great deal more . 
She would have liked to encounter her `` passer-by , '' to see what he would say , and to `` teach him a lesson ! '' 
The truth is , that she was ravishing in every respect , and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way . 
Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety . 
He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl , walk at the most , beheld wings sprouting on Cosette . 
Moreover , from the mere inspection of Cosette 's toilet , a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother . 
Certain little proprieties , certain special conventionalities , were not observed by Cosette . 
A mother , for instance , would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask . 
The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle , and her white crape bonnet , she took Jean Valjean 's arm , gay , radiant , rosy , proud , dazzling . 
`` Father , '' she said , `` how do you like me in this guise ? '' 
Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man : `` Charming ! '' 
He was the same as usual during their walk . 
On their return home , he asked Cosette : -- `` Wo n't you put on that other gown and bonnet again , -- you know the ones I mean ? '' 
This took place in Cosette 's chamber . 
Cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl 's clothes were hanging . 
`` That disguise ! '' 
said she . 
`` Father , what do you want me to do with it ? 
Oh no , the idea ! 
I shall never put on those horrors again . 
With that machine on my head , I have the air of Madame Mad-dog . '' 
Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh . 
From that moment forth , he noticed that Cosette , who had always heretofore asked to remain at home , saying : `` Father , I enjoy myself more here with you , '' now was always asking to go out . 
In fact , what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them ? 
He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden . 
Now she preferred the garden , and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence . 
Jean Valjean , who was shy , never set foot in the garden . 
He kept to his back yard , like a dog . 
Cosette , in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful , lost the grace of ignoring it . 
An exquisite grace , for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable , and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along , holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it . 
But what she had lost in ingenuous grace , she gained in pensive and serious charm . 
Her whole person , permeated with the joy of youth , of innocence , and of beauty , breathed forth a splendid melancholy . 
It was at this epoch that Marius , after the lapse of six months , saw her once more at the Luxembourg . 
THE BATTLE BEGUN Cosette in her shadow , like Marius in his , was all ready to take fire . 
Destiny , with its mysterious and fatal patience , slowly drew together these two beings , all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion , these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning , and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire . 
The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute . 
One hardly dares to say , nowadays , that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other . 
That is the way people do fall in love , nevertheless , and the only way . 
The rest is nothing , but the rest comes afterwards . 
Nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark . 
At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled Marius , Marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette . 
He caused her the same good and the same evil . 
She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time , and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see , while looking elsewhere . 
Marius still considered Cosette ugly , when she had already begun to think Marius handsome . 
But as he paid no attention to her , the young man was nothing to her . 
Still , she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair , beautiful eyes , handsome teeth , a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades , that he held himself badly when he walked , if you like , but with a grace that was all his own , that he did not appear to be at all stupid , that his whole person was noble , gentle , simple , proud , and that , in short , though he seemed to be poor , yet his air was fine . 
On the day when their eyes met at last , and said to each other those first , obscure , and ineffable things which the glance lisps , Cosette did not immediately understand . 
She returned thoughtfully to the house in the Rue de l'Ouest , where Jean Valjean , according to his custom , had come to spend six weeks . 
The next morning , on waking , she thought of that strange young man , so long indifferent and icy , who now seemed to pay attention to her , and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her . 
She was , on the contrary , somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual . 
A substratum of war stirred within her . 
It struck her , and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy , that she was going to take her revenge at last . 
Knowing that she was beautiful , she was thoroughly conscious , though in an indistinct fashion , that she possessed a weapon . 
Women play with their beauty as children do with a knife . 
They wound themselves . 
The reader will recall Marius ' hesitations , his palpitations , his terrors . 
He remained on his bench and did not approach . 
This vexed Cosette . 
One day , she said to Jean Valjean : `` Father , let us stroll about a little in that direction . '' 
Seeing that Marius did not come to her , she went to him . 
In such cases , all women resemble Mahomet . 
And then , strange to say , the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity ; in a young girl it is boldness . 
This is surprising , and yet nothing is more simple . 
It is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming , each the other 's qualities . 
That day , Cosette 's glance drove Marius beside himself , and Marius ' glance set Cosette to trembling . 
Marius went away confident , and Cosette uneasy . 
From that day forth , they adored each other . 
The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy . 
It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before . 
She no longer recognized it . 
The whiteness of soul in young girls , which is composed of coldness and gayety , resembles snow . 
It melts in love , which is its sun . 
Cosette did not know what love was . 
She had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense . 
On the books of profane music which entered the convent , amour -LRB- love -RRB- was replaced by tambour -LRB- drum -RRB- or pandour . 
This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls , such as : Ah , how delightful is the drum ! 
or , Pity is not a pandour . 
But Cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the `` drum . '' 
Therefore , she did not know what name to give to what she now felt . 
Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one 's malady ? 
She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly . 
She did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing , useful or dangerous , eternal or temporary , allowable or prohibited ; she loved . 
She would have been greatly astonished , had any one said to her : `` You do not sleep ? 
But that is forbidden ! 
You do not eat ? 
Why , that is very bad ! 
You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart ? 
That must not be ! 
You blush and turn pale , when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk ? 
But that is abominable ! '' 
She would not have understood , and she would have replied : `` What fault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing ? '' 
It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul . 
It was a sort of admiration at a distance , a mute contemplation , the deification of a stranger . 
It was the apparition of youth to youth , the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream , the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last , but having as yet , neither name , nor fault , nor spot , nor exigence , nor defect ; in a word , the distant lover who lingered in the ideal , a chimaera with a form . 
Any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at this first stage , when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister . 
She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined . 
The spirit of the convent , with which she had been permeated for the space of five years , was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person , and made everything tremble around her . 
In this situation he was not a lover , he was not even an admirer , he was a vision . 
She set herself to adoring Marius as something charming , luminous , and impossible . 
As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry , she smiled at him with all frankness . 
Every day , she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience , she found Marius there , she felt herself unspeakably happy , and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to Jean Valjean : -- `` What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is ! '' 
Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another . 
They did not address each other , they did not salute each other , they did not know each other ; they saw each other ; and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues , they lived by gazing at each other . 
It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed , beautiful and loving , with a consciousness of her beauty , and in ignorance of her love . 
She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance . 
TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF All situations have their instincts . 
Old and eternal Mother Nature warned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius . 
Jean Valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul . 
Jean Valjean saw nothing , knew nothing , and yet he scanned with obstinate attention , the darkness in which he walked , as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction , and on the other , something which was crumbling away . 
Marius , also warned , and , in accordance with the deep law of God , by that same Mother Nature , did all he could to keep out of sight of `` the father . '' 
Nevertheless , it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes espied him . 
Marius ' manners were no longer in the least natural . 
He exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring . 
He no longer came quite close to them as formerly . 
He seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading ; why did he pretend that ? 
Formerly he had come in his old coat , now he wore his new one every day ; Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled , his eyes were very queer , he wore gloves ; in short , Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man . 
Cosette allowed nothing to be divined . 
Without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it , and that it must be concealed . 
There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to Cosette , and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean . 
It might be accidental , no doubt , certainly , but it was a menacing accident . 
He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger . 
One day , however , he could not refrain from so doing , and , with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair , he said to her : `` What a very pedantic air that young man has ! '' 
Cosette , but a year before only an indifferent little girl , would have replied : `` Why , no , he is charming . '' 
Ten years later , with the love of Marius in her heart , she would have answered : `` A pedant , and insufferable to the sight ! 
You are right ! '' 
-- At the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained , she contented herself with replying , with supreme calmness : `` That young man ! '' 
As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life . 
`` How stupid I am ! '' 
thought Jean Valjean . 
`` She had not noticed him . 
It is I who have pointed him out to her . '' 
Oh , simplicity of the old ! 
oh , the depth of children ! 
It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble , of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles , that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever , and that the young man falls into every one . 
Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared war against Marius , which Marius , with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age , did not divine . 
Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him ; he changed his hour , he changed his bench , he forgot his handkerchief , he came alone to the Luxembourg ; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares ; and to all the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway , he ingenuously answered `` yes . '' 
But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity , so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following conclusion : `` That ninny is madly in love with Cosette , but Cosette does not even know that he exists . '' 
None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor . 
The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment . 
Does not everything begin with indifference ? 
Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him . 
He rose from his seat to depart , after a stay of three hours , and she said : `` What , already ? '' 
Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg , as he did not wish to do anything out of the way , and as , above all things , he feared to arouse Cosette ; but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers , while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius , who perceived nothing else now , and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face , Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing and terrible eyes . 
He , who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling , experienced moments when Marius was present , in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more , and he felt the old depths of his soul , which had formerly contained so much wrath , opening once more and rising up against that young man . 
It almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom . 
What ! 
he was there , that creature ! 
What was he there for ? 
He came creeping about , smelling out , examining , trying ! 
He came , saying : `` Hey ! 
Why not ? '' 
He came to prowl about his , Jean Valjean 's , life ! 
to prowl about his happiness , with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away ! 
Jean Valjean added : `` Yes , that 's it ! 
What is he in search of ? 
An adventure ! 
What does he want ? 
A love affair ! 
A love affair ! 
And I ? 
What ! 
I have been first , the most wretched of men , and then the most unhappy , and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees , I have suffered everything that man can suffer , I have grown old without having been young , I have lived without a family , without relatives , without friends , without life , without children , I have left my blood on every stone , on every bramble , on every mile-post , along every wall , I have been gentle , though others have been hard to me , and kind , although others have been malicious , I have become an honest man once more , in spite of everything , I have repented of the evil that I have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me , and at the moment when I receive my recompense , at the moment when it is all over , at the moment when I am just touching the goal , at the moment when I have what I desire , it is well , it is good , I have paid , I have earned it , all this is to take flight , all this will vanish , and I shall lose Cosette , and I shall lose my life , my joy , my soul , because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg . '' 
Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam . 
It was no longer a man gazing at a man ; it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy . 
It was a dog scanning a thief . 
The reader knows the rest . 
Marius pursued his senseless course . 
One day he followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest . 
Another day he spoke to the porter . 
The porter , on his side , spoke , and said to Jean Valjean : `` Monsieur , who is that curious young man who is asking for you ? '' 
On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last perceived . 
A week later , Jean Valjean had taken his departure . 
He swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg or in the Rue de l'Ouest . 
He returned to the Rue Plumet . 
Cosette did not complain , she said nothing , she asked no questions , she did not seek to learn his reasons ; she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined , and of betraying herself . 
Jean Valjean had no experience of these miseries , the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted ; the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of Cosette 's silence . 
He merely noticed that she had grown sad , and he grew gloomy . 
On his side and on hers , inexperience had joined issue . 
Once he made a trial . 
He asked Cosette : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? '' 
A ray illuminated Cosette 's pale face . 
`` Yes , '' said she . 
They went thither . 
Three months had elapsed . 
Marius no longer went there . 
Marius was not there . 
On the following day , Jean Valjean asked Cosette again : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? '' 
She replied , sadly and gently : -- `` No . '' 
Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness , and heart-broken at this gentleness . 
What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable ? 
What was on its way there within ? 
What was taking place in Cosette 's soul ? 
Sometimes , instead of going to bed , Jean Valjean remained seated on his pallet , with his head in his hands , and he passed whole nights asking himself : `` What has Cosette in her mind ? '' 
and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about . 
Oh ! 
at such moments , what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister , that chaste peak , that abode of angels , that inaccessible glacier of virtue ! 
How he contemplated , with despairing ecstasy , that convent garden , full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins , where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven ! 
How he adored that Eden forever closed against him , whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged ! 
How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought Cosette back into the world , poor hero of sacrifice , seized and hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion ! 
How he said to himself , `` What have I done ? '' 
However , nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette . 
No ill-temper , no harshness . 
His face was always serene and kind . 
Jean Valjean 's manners were more tender and more paternal than ever . 
If anything could have betrayed his lack of joy , it was his increased suavity . 
On her side , Cosette languished . 
She suffered from the absence of Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence , peculiarly , without exactly being conscious of it . 
When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls , a feminine instinct murmured confusedly , at the bottom of her heart , that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden , and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her , her father would take her thither once more . 
But days , weeks , months , elapsed . 
Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette 's tacit consent . 
She regretted it . 
It was too late . 
So Marius had disappeared ; all was over . 
The day on which she returned to the Luxembourg , Marius was no longer there . 
What was to be done ? 
Should she ever find him again ? 
She felt an anguish at her heart , which nothing relieved , and which augmented every day ; she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer , whether it was raining or shining , whether the birds were singing , whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies , whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries , whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough , whether Toussaint had done `` her marketing '' well or ill ; and she remained dejected , absorbed , attentive to but a single thought , her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished . 
However , she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this , except her pallor . 
She still wore her sweet face for him . 
This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean . 
Sometimes he asked her : -- `` What is the matter with you ? '' 
She replied : `` There is nothing the matter with me . '' 
And after a silence , when she divined that he was sad also , she would add : -- `` And you , father -- is there anything wrong with you ? '' 
`` With me ? 
Nothing , '' said he . 
These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively , and with so touching an affection , and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side , each on the other 's account ; without acknowledging it to each other , without anger towards each other , and with a smile . 
THE CHAIN-GANG Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two . 
Youth , even in its sorrows , always possesses its own peculiar radiance . 
At times , Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile . 
It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear . 
He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him . 
He would have liked to resist , to retain her , to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter . 
These ideas , puerile , as we have just said , and at the same time senile , conveyed to him , by their very childishness , a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls . 
He once chanced to see a general on horseback , in full uniform , pass along the street , Comte Coutard , the commandant of Paris . 
He envied that gilded man ; what happiness it would be , he said to himself , if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing ; and if Cosette could behold him thus , she would be dazzled , and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries , the guard would present arms to him , and that would suffice for Cosette , and would dispel her idea of looking at young men . 
An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections . 
In the isolated life which they led , and since they had come to dwell in the Rue Plumet , they had contracted one habit . 
They sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise , a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it . 
For those who love solitude , a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night , with the cheerfulness of nature added . 
The streets are deserted and the birds are singing . 
Cosette , a bird herself , liked to rise early . 
These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening . 
He proposed , and she agreed . 
It was arranged like a plot , they set out before daybreak , and these trips were so many small delights for Cosette . 
These innocent eccentricities please young people . 
Jean Valjean 's inclination led him , as we have seen , to the least frequented spots , to solitary nooks , to forgotten places . 
There then existed , in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris , a sort of poor meadows , which were almost confounded with the city , where grew in summer sickly grain , and which , in autumn , after the harvest had been gathered , presented the appearance , not of having been reaped , but peeled . 
Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields . 
Cosette was not bored there . 
It meant solitude to him and liberty to her . 
There , she became a little girl once more , she could run and almost play ; she took off her hat , laid it on Jean Valjean 's knees , and gathered bunches of flowers . 
She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers , but did not catch them ; gentleness and tenderness are born with love , and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly . 
She wove garlands of poppies , which she placed on her head , and which , crossed and penetrated with sunlight , glowing until they flamed , formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers . 
Even after their life had grown sad , they kept up their custom of early strolls . 
One morning in October , therefore , tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of 1831 , they set out , and found themselves at break of day near the Barriere du Maine . 
It was not dawn , it was daybreak ; a delightful and stern moment . 
A few constellations here and there in the deep , pale azure , the earth all black , the heavens all white , a quiver amid the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight . 
A lark , which seemed mingled with the stars , was carolling at a prodigious height , and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity . 
In the East , the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel ; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice . 
All was peace and silence ; there was no one on the road ; a few stray laborers , of whom they caught barely a glimpse , were on their way to their work along the side-paths . 
Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber-yard . 
His face was turned towards the highway , his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising ; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated , which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls . 
There are meditations which may be called vertical ; when one is at the bottom of them , time is required to return to earth . 
Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries . 
He was thinking of Cosette , of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her , of the light with which she filled his life , a light which was but the emanation of her soul . 
He was almost happy in his revery . 
Cosette , who was standing beside him , was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy . 
All at once Cosette exclaimed : `` Father , I should think some one was coming yonder . '' 
Jean Valjean raised his eyes . 
Cosette was right . 
The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere du Maine is a prolongation , as the reader knows , of the Rue de Sevres , and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard . 
At the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard , at the spot where it branches , they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour , and a sort of confused pile made its appearance . 
Some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road . 
It grew larger , it seemed to move in an orderly manner , though it was bristling and quivering ; it seemed to be a vehicle , but its load could not be distinctly made out . 
There were horses , wheels , shouts ; whips were cracking . 
By degrees the outlines became fixed , although bathed in shadows . 
It was a vehicle , in fact , which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway , and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean ; a second , of the same aspect , followed , then a third , then a fourth ; seven chariots made their appearance in succession , the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front . 
Figures were moving on these vehicles , flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there , a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains , and as this something advanced , the sound of voices waxed louder , and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams . 
As it drew nearer , it assumed a form , and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition ; the mass grew white ; the day , which was slowly dawning , cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living , the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses , and this is what it proved to be : -- Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road . 
The first six were singularly constructed . 
They resembled coopers ' drays ; they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities . 
Each dray , or rather let us say , each ladder , was attached to four horses harnessed tandem . 
On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn . 
In the faint light , these men were to be divined rather than seen . 
Twenty-four on each vehicle , twelve on a side , back to back , facing the passers-by , their legs dangling in the air , -- this was the manner in which these men were travelling , and behind their backs they had something which clanked , and which was a chain , and on their necks something which shone , and which was an iron collar . 
Each man had his collar , but the chain was for all ; so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk , they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity , and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone , somewhat after the fashion of millepeds . 
In the back and front of each vehicle , two men armed with muskets stood erect , each holding one end of the chain under his foot . 
The iron necklets were square . 
The seventh vehicle , a huge rack-sided baggage wagon , without a hood , had four wheels and six horses , and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers , cast-iron pots , braziers , and chains , among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length , and who seemed to be ill . 
This wagon , all lattice-work , was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments . 
These vehicles kept to the middle of the road . 
On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect , wearing three-cornered hats , like the soldiers under the Directory , shabby , covered with spots and holes , muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers ' men , half gray , half blue , which were almost hanging in rags , with red epaulets , yellow shoulder belts , short sabres , muskets , and cudgels ; they were a species of soldier-blackguards . 
These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner . 
The one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion 's whip in his hand . 
All these details , blurred by the dimness of dawn , became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased . 
At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes , serious and with sword in fist . 
This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier , the last was barely debauching from the boulevard . 
A throng , sprung , it is impossible to say whence , and formed in a twinkling , as is frequently the case in Paris , pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on . 
In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible . 
The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence . 
They were livid with the chill of morning . 
They all wore linen trousers , and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes . 
The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness . 
Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous ; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags . 
Battered felt hats , tarpaulin caps , hideous woollen nightcaps , and , side by side with a short blouse , a black coat broken at the elbow ; many wore women 's headgear , others had baskets on their heads ; hairy breasts were visible , and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried ; temples of Love , flaming hearts , Cupids ; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen . 
Two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray , and suspended under them like a stirrup , which supported their feet . 
One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing ; it was bread which he was eating . 
There were no eyes there which were not either dry , dulled , or flaming with an evil light . 
The escort troop cursed , the men in chains did not utter a syllable ; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls ; some of these men were yawning ; their rags were terrible ; their feet hung down , their shoulders oscillated , their heads clashed together , their fetters clanked , their eyes glared ferociously , their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses ; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter . 
This file of vehicles , whatever its nature was , was mournful . 
It was evident that to-morrow , that an hour hence , a pouring rain might descend , that it might be followed by another and another , and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched , that once soaked , these men would not get dry again , that once chilled , they would not again get warm , that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour , that the water would fill their shoes , that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering , that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck , that their legs would continue to dangle , and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn , and delivered over to the rain , to the blast , to all the furies of the air , like trees and stones . 
Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men , who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon , and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery . 
Suddenly , the sun made its appearance ; the immense light of the Orient burst forth , and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads . 
Their tongues were unloosed ; a conflagration of grins , oaths , and songs exploded . 
The broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts , illuminating heads and bodies , leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity . 
Thoughts made their appearance on these faces ; it was a terrible moment ; visible demons with their masks removed , fierce souls laid bare . 
Though lighted up , this wild throng remained in gloom . 
Some , who were gay , had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd , picking out the women ; the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows ; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness ; and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun 's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning . 
The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song , and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality , a potpourri by Desaugiers , then famous , called The Vestal ; the trees shivered mournfully ; in the cross-lanes , countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres . 
All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos ; here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast , old men , youths , bald heads , gray beards , cynical monstrosities , sour resignation , savage grins , senseless attitudes , snouts surmounted by caps , heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples , infantile visages , and by reason of that , horrible thin skeleton faces , to which death alone was lacking . 
On the first cart was a negro , who had been a slave , in all probability , and who could make a comparison of his chains . 
The frightful leveller from below , shame , had passed over these brows ; at that degree of abasement , the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths , and ignorance , converted into dulness , was the equal of intelligence converted into despair . 
There was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud . 
It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them . 
These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell , in alphabetical disorder , probably , and loaded hap-hazard on those carts . 
Nevertheless , horrors , when grouped together , always end by evolving a result ; all additions of wretched men give a sum total , each chain exhaled a common soul , and each dray-load had its own physiognomy . 
By the side of the one where they were singing , there was one where they were howling ; a third where they were begging ; one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth ; another load menaced the spectators , another blasphemed God ; the last was as silent as the tomb . 
Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march . 
The march of the damned to their tortures , performed in sinister wise , not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse , but , what was more mournful than that , on the gibbet cart . 
One of the guards , who had a hook on the end of his cudgel , made a pretence from time to time , of stirring up this mass of human filth . 
An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old , and said to him : `` Rascal , let that be a warning to you ! '' 
As the songs and blasphemies increased , the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip , and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging , which produced the sound of hail , fell upon the seven dray-loads ; many roared and foamed at the mouth ; which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up , a swarm of flies on these wounds . 
Jean Valjean 's eyes had assumed a frightful expression . 
They were no longer eyes ; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men , which seem unconscious of reality , and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes . 
He was not looking at a spectacle , he was seeing a vision . 
He tried to rise , to flee , to make his escape ; he could not move his feet . 
Sometimes , the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast . 
He remained nailed to the spot , petrified , stupid , asking himself , athwart confused and inexpressible anguish , what this sepulchral persecution signified , and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him . 
All at once , he raised his hand to his brow , a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns ; he remembered that this was , in fact , the usual itinerary , that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau , and that , five and thirty years before , he had himself passed through that barrier . 
Cosette was no less terrified , but in a different way . 
She did not understand ; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible ; at length she cried : -- `` Father ! 
What are those men in those carts ? '' 
Jean Valjean replied : `` Convicts . '' 
`` Whither are they going ? '' 
`` To the galleys . '' 
At that moment , the cudgelling , multiplied by a hundred hands , became zealous , blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it , it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs ; the convicts bent before it , a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture , and all held their peace , darting glances like chained wolves . 
Cosette trembled in every limb ; she resumed : -- `` Father , are they still men ? '' 
`` Sometimes , '' answered the unhappy man . 
It was the chain-gang , in fact , which had set out before daybreak from Bicetre , and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau , where the King then was . 
This caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer ; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it . 
Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed . 
Such encounters are shocks , and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up . 
Nevertheless , Jean Valjean did not observe that , on his way back to the Rue de Babylone with Cosette , the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen ; perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them . 
But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening , to betake herself to bed , he heard her say in a low voice , and as though talking to herself : `` It seems to me , that if I were to find one of those men in my pathway , oh , my God , I should die merely from the sight of him close at hand . '' 
Fortunately , chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day , there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what , -- fetes in Paris , a review in the Champ de Mars , jousts on the Seine , theatrical performances in the Champs-Elysees , fireworks at the Arc de l'Etoile , illuminations everywhere . 
Jean Valjean did violence to his habits , and took Cosette to see these rejoicings , for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before , and of effacing , beneath the smiling tumult of all Paris , the abominable thing which had passed before her . 
The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural ; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter . 
However , this trip seemed to attain its object . 
Cosette , who made it her law to please her father , and to whom , moreover , all spectacles were a novelty , accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth , and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete ; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded , and that no trace of that hideous vision remained . 
Some days later , one morning , when the sun was shining brightly , and they were both on the steps leading to the garden , another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself , and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt , Cosette , in a wrapper , was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star ; and , with her head bathed in light , rosy after a good sleep , submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man , she was picking a daisy to pieces . 
Cosette did not know the delightful legend , I love a little , passionately , etc. -- who was there who could have taught her ? 
She was handling the flower instinctively , innocently , without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart . 
If there were a fourth , and smiling Grace called Melancholy , she would have worn the air of that Grace . 
Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower , and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child . 
A red-breast was warbling in the thicket , on one side . 
White cloudlets floated across the sky , so gayly , that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty . 
Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower ; she seemed to be thinking about something ; but whatever it was , it must be something charming ; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan , and said to Jean Valjean : `` Father , what are the galleys like ? '' 
A WOUND WITHOUT , HEALING WITHIN Thus their life clouded over by degrees . 
But one diversion , which had formerly been a happiness , remained to them , which was to carry bread to those who were hungry , and clothing to those who were cold . 
Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to the poor , on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse ; and sometimes , when the day had been a good one , and they had assisted many in distress , and cheered and warmed many little children , Cosette was rather merry in the evening . 
It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den . 
On the day following that visit , Jean Valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning , calm as was his wont , but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed , and very angry , which resembled a burn , and which he explained in some way or other . 
This wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever . 
He would not call in a doctor . 
When Cosette urged him , `` Call the dog-doctor , '' said he . 
Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him , that Jean Valjean felt all his former joy returning , his fears and anxieties dissipating , and he gazed at Cosette , saying : `` Oh ! 
what a kindly wound ! 
Oh ! 
what a good misfortune ! '' 
Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill , had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard . 
She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him the books which he desired . 
Generally they were books of travel . 
Jean Valjean was undergoing a new birth ; his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays ; the Luxembourg , the prowling young stranger , Cosette 's coldness , -- all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim . 
He had reached the point where he said to himself : `` I imagined all that . 
I am an old fool . '' 
His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the Thenardiers made in the Jondrette hovel , unexpected as it was , had , after a fashion , glided over him unnoticed . 
He had succeeded in making his escape ; all trace of him was lost -- what more did he care for ! 
he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them . 
`` Here they are in prison , and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm , '' he thought , `` but what a lamentable family in distress ! '' 
As for the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine , Cosette had not referred to it again . 
Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent ; Cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul , and sometimes , in the evening , in the wounded man 's humble abode , she warbled melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean . 
Spring came ; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year , that Jean Valjean said to Cosette : -- `` You never go there ; I want you to stroll in it . '' 
`` As you like , father , '' said Cosette . 
And for the sake of obeying her father , she resumed her walks in the garden , generally alone , for , as we have mentioned , Jean Valjean , who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence , hardly ever went there . 
Jean Valjean 's wound had created a diversion . 
When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less , that he was convalescing , and that he appeared to be happy , she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive , so gently and naturally had it come . 
Then , it was in the month of March , the days were growing longer , the winter was departing , the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness ; then came April , that daybreak of summer , fresh as dawn always is , gay like every childhood ; a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it is . 
In that month , nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky , from the trees , from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man . 
Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that April joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself . 
Insensibly , and without her suspecting the fact , the blackness departed from her spirit . 
In spring , sad souls grow light , as light falls into cellars at midday . 
Cosette was no longer sad . 
However , though this was so , she did not account for it to herself . 
In the morning , about ten o'clock , after breakfast , when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour , and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps , supporting his left arm for him , she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy . 
Jean Valjean , intoxicated , beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more . 
`` Oh ! 
What a good wound ! '' 
he repeated in a whisper . 
And he felt grateful to the Thenardiers . 
His wound once healed , he resumed his solitary twilight strolls . 
It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some adventure . 
MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A PHENOMENON One evening , little Gavroche had had nothing to eat ; he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either ; this was becoming tiresome . 
He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper . 
He strolled out beyond the Salpetriere into deserted regions ; that is where windfalls are to be found ; where there is no one , one always finds something . 
He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of Austerlitz . 
In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman , and in that garden , a passable apple-tree . 
Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house , which was not securely fastened , and where one might contrive to get an apple . 
One apple is a supper ; one apple is life . 
That which was Adam 's ruin might prove Gavroche 's salvation . 
The garden abutted on a solitary , unpaved lane , bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses ; the garden was separated from it by a hedge . 
Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden ; he found the lane , he recognized the apple-tree , he verified the fruit-house , he examined the hedge ; a hedge means merely one stride . 
The day was declining , there was not even a cat in the lane , the hour was propitious . 
Gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge , then suddenly paused . 
Some one was talking in the garden . 
Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge . 
A couple of paces distant , at the foot of the hedge on the other side , exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made , there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench , and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden , while the old woman was standing in front of him . 
The old woman was grumbling . 
Gavroche , who was not very discreet , listened . 
`` Monsieur Mabeuf ! '' 
said the old woman . 
`` Mabeuf ! '' 
thought Gavroche , `` that name is a perfect farce . '' 
The old man who was thus addressed , did not stir . 
The old woman repeated : -- `` Monsieur Mabeuf ! '' 
The old man , without raising his eyes from the ground , made up his mind to answer : -- `` What is it , Mother Plutarque ? '' 
`` Mother Plutarque ! '' 
thought Gavroche , `` another farcical name . '' 
Mother Plutarque began again , and the old man was forced to accept the conversation : -- `` The landlord is not pleased . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` We owe three quarters rent . '' 
`` In three months , we shall owe him for four quarters . '' 
`` He says that he will turn you out to sleep . '' 
`` I will go . '' 
`` The green-grocer insists on being paid . 
She will no longer leave her fagots . 
What will you warm yourself with this winter ? 
We shall have no wood . '' 
`` There is the sun . '' 
`` The butcher refuses to give credit ; he will not let us have any more meat . '' 
`` That is quite right . 
I do not digest meat well . 
It is too heavy . '' 
`` What shall we have for dinner ? '' 
`` Bread . '' 
`` The baker demands a settlement , and says , ` no money , no bread . ' '' 
`` That is well . '' 
`` What will you eat ? '' 
`` We have apples in the apple-room . '' 
`` But , Monsieur , we ca n't live like that without money . '' 
`` I have none . '' 
The old woman went away , the old man remained alone . 
He fell into thought . 
Gavroche became thoughtful also . 
It was almost dark . 
The first result of Gavroche 's meditation was , that instead of scaling the hedge , he crouched down under it . 
The branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket . 
`` Come , '' exclaimed Gavroche mentally , `` here 's a nook ! '' 
and he curled up in it . 
His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf 's bench . 
He could hear the octogenarian breathe . 
Then , by way of dinner , he tried to sleep . 
It was a cat-nap , with one eye open . 
While he dozed , Gavroche kept on the watch . 
The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth , and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes . 
All at once , in this whitish band , two figures made their appearance . 
One was in front , the other some distance in the rear . 
`` There come two creatures , '' muttered Gavroche . 
The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois , who was bent and thoughtful , dressed more than plainly , and who was walking slowly because of his age , and strolling about in the open evening air . 
The second was straight , firm , slender . 
It regulated its pace by that of the first ; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait , suppleness and agility were discernible . 
This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it , the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant ; the hat was of good shape , the coat black , well cut , probably of fine cloth , and well fitted in at the waist . 
The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace , and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light . 
The profile had a rose in its mouth . 
This second form was well known to Gavroche ; it was Montparnasse . 
He could have told nothing about the other , except that he was a respectable old man . 
Gavroche immediately began to take observations . 
One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other . 
Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events . 
The bedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment . 
Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour , in such a place , betokened something threatening . 
Gavroche felt his gamin 's heart moved with compassion for the old man . 
What was he to do ? 
Interfere ? 
One weakness coming to the aid of another ! 
It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse . 
Gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man , in the first place , and the child in the second , would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age . 
While Gavroche was deliberating , the attack took place , abruptly and hideously . 
The attack of the tiger on the wild ass , the attack of the spider on the fly . 
Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose , bounded upon the old man , seized him by the collar , grasped and clung to him , and Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream . 
A moment later one of these men was underneath the other , groaning , struggling , with a knee of marble upon his breast . 
Only , it was not just what Gavroche had expected . 
The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse ; the one who was on top was the old man . 
All this took place a few paces distant from Gavroche . 
The old man had received the shock , had returned it , and that in such a terrible fashion , that in a twinkling , the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles . 
`` Here 's a hearty veteran ! '' 
thought Gavroche . 
He could not refrain from clapping his hands . 
But it was applause wasted . 
It did not reach the combatants , absorbed and deafened as they were , each by the other , as their breath mingled in the struggle . 
Silence ensued . 
Montparnasse ceased his struggles . 
Gavroche indulged in this aside : `` Can he be dead ! '' 
The goodman had not uttered a word , nor given vent to a cry . 
He rose to his feet , and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse : -- `` Get up . '' 
Montparnasse rose , but the goodman held him fast . 
Montparnasse 's attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep . 
Gavroche looked on and listened , making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears . 
He was enjoying himself immensely . 
He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator . 
He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent . 
The goodman questioned , Montparnasse replied . 
`` How old are you ? '' 
`` Nineteen . '' 
`` You are strong and healthy . 
Why do you not work ? '' 
`` It bores me . '' 
`` What is your trade ? '' 
`` An idler . '' 
`` Speak seriously . 
Can anything be done for you ? 
What would you like to be ? '' 
`` A thief . '' 
A pause ensued . 
The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought . 
He stood motionless , and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse . 
Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare . 
He gave a jerk , tried a crook of the knee , twisted his limbs desperately , and made efforts to escape . 
The old man did not appear to notice it , and held both his arms with one hand , with the sovereign indifference of absolute force . 
The old man 's revery lasted for some time , then , looking steadily at Montparnasse , he addressed to him in a gentle voice , in the midst of the darkness where they stood , a solemn harangue , of which Gavroche did not lose a single syllable : -- `` My child , you are entering , through indolence , on one of the most laborious of lives . 
Ah ! 
You declare yourself to be an idler ! 
prepare to toil . 
There is a certain formidable machine , have you seen it ? 
It is the rolling-mill . 
You must be on your guard against it , it is crafty and ferocious ; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat , you will be drawn in bodily . 
That machine is laziness . 
Stop while there is yet time , and save yourself ! 
Otherwise , it is all over with you ; in a short time you will be among the gearing . 
Once entangled , hope for nothing more . 
Toil , lazybones ! 
there is no more repose for you ! 
The iron hand of implacable toil has seized you . 
You do not wish to earn your living , to have a task , to fulfil a duty ! 
It bores you to be like other men ? 
Well ! 
You will be different . 
Labor is the law ; he who rejects it will find ennui his torment . 
You do not wish to be a workingman , you will be a slave . 
Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other . 
You do not desire to be its friend , you shall be its negro slave . 
Ah ! 
You would have none of the honest weariness of men , you shall have the sweat of the damned . 
Where others sing , you will rattle in your throat . 
You will see afar off , from below , other men at work ; it will seem to you that they are resting . 
The laborer , the harvester , the sailor , the blacksmith , will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise . 
What radiance surrounds the forge ! 
To guide the plough , to bind the sheaves , is joy . 
The bark at liberty in the wind , what delight ! 
Do you , lazy idler , delve , drag on , roll , march ! 
Drag your halter . 
You are a beast of burden in the team of hell ! 
Ah ! 
To do nothing is your object . 
Well , not a week , not a day , not an hour shall you have free from oppression . 
You will be able to lift nothing without anguish . 
Every minute that passes will make your muscles crack . 
What is a feather to others will be a rock to you . 
The simplest things will become steep acclivities . 
Life will become monstrous all about you . 
To go , to come , to breathe , will be just so many terrible labors . 
Your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds . 
Whether you shall walk here rather than there , will become a problem that must be solved . 
Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push , and there he is in the open air . 
If you wish to go out , you will be obliged to pierce your wall . 
What does every one who wants to step into the street do ? 
He goes down stairs ; you will tear up your sheets , little by little you will make of them a rope , then you will climb out of your window , and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss , and it will be night , amid storm , rain , and the hurricane , and if the rope is too short , but one way of descending will remain to you , to fall . 
To drop hap-hazard into the gulf , from an unknown height , on what ? 
On what is beneath , on the unknown . 
Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue , at the risk of burning ; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe , at the risk of drowning ; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask , of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day , of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet . 
A lock presents itself ; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith . 
If you wish to pass out , you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art ; you will take a large sou , you will cut it in two plates ; with what tools ? 
You will have to invent them . 
That is your business . 
Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates , taking great care of the outside , and you will make on the edges a thread , so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover . 
The top and bottom thus screwed together , nothing will be suspected . 
To the overseers it will be only a sou ; to you it will be a box . 
What will you put in this box ? 
A small bit of steel . 
A watch-spring , in which you will have cut teeth , and which will form a saw . 
With this saw , as long as a pin , and concealed in a sou , you will cut the bolt of the lock , you will sever bolts , the padlock of your chain , and the bar at your window , and the fetter on your leg . 
This masterpiece finished , this prodigy accomplished , all these miracles of art , address , skill , and patience executed , what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author ? 
The dungeon . 
There is your future . 
What precipices are idleness and pleasure ! 
Do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution ? 
To live in idleness on the property of society ! 
to be useless , that is to say , pernicious ! 
This leads straight to the depth of wretchedness . 
Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite ! 
He will become vermin ! 
Ah ! 
So it does not please you to work ? 
Ah ! 
You have but one thought , to drink well , to eat well , to sleep well . 
You will drink water , you will eat black bread , you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long , riveted to your limbs . 
You will break those fetters , you will flee . 
That is well . 
You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood , and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest . 
And you will be recaptured . 
And then you will pass years in a dungeon , riveted to a wall , groping for your jug that you may drink , gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch , eating beans that the worms have eaten before you . 
You will be a wood-louse in a cellar . 
Ah ! 
Have pity on yourself , you miserable young child , who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago , and who have , no doubt , a mother still alive ! 
I conjure you , listen to me , I entreat you . 
You desire fine black cloth , varnished shoes , to have your hair curled and sweet-smelling oils on your locks , to please low women , to be handsome . 
You will be shaven clean , and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes . 
You want rings on your fingers , you will have an iron necklet on your neck . 
If you glance at a woman , you will receive a blow . 
And you will enter there at the age of twenty . 
And you will come out at fifty ! 
You will enter young , rosy , fresh , with brilliant eyes , and all your white teeth , and your handsome , youthful hair ; you will come out broken , bent , wrinkled , toothless , horrible , with white locks ! 
Ah ! 
my poor child , you are on the wrong road ; idleness is counselling you badly ; the hardest of all work is thieving . 
Believe me , do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man . 
It is not comfortable to become a rascal . 
It is less disagreeable to be an honest man . 
Now go , and ponder on what I have said to you . 
By the way , what did you want of me ? 
My purse ? 
Here it is . '' 
And the old man , releasing Montparnasse , put his purse in the latter 's hand ; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment , after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat , with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it . 
All this having been said and done , the goodman turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll . 
`` The blockhead ! '' 
muttered Montparnasse . 
Who was this goodman ? 
The reader has , no doubt , already divined . 
Montparnasse watched him with amazement , as he disappeared in the dusk . 
This contemplation was fatal to him . 
While the old man was walking away , Gavroche drew near . 
Gavroche had assured himself , with a sidelong glance , that Father Mabeuf was still sitting on his bench , probably sound asleep . 
Then the gamin emerged from his thicket , and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the dark , as the latter stood there motionless . 
In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without being seen or heard , gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth , seized the purse , withdrew his hand , and having recourse once more to his crawling , he slipped away like an adder through the shadows . 
Montparnasse , who had no reason to be on his guard , and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life , perceived nothing . 
When Gavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was , he flung the purse over the hedge , and fled as fast as his legs would carry him . 
The purse fell on Father Mabeuf 's foot . 
This commotion roused him . 
He bent over and picked up the purse . 
He did not understand in the least , and opened it . 
The purse had two compartments ; in one of them there was some small change ; in the other lay six napoleons . 
M. Mabeuf , in great alarm , referred the matter to his housekeeper . 
`` That has fallen from heaven , '' said Mother Plutarque . 
SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED Cosette 's grief , which had been so poignant and lively four or five months previously , had , without her being conscious of the fact , entered upon its convalescence . 
Nature , spring , youth , love for her father , the gayety of the birds and flowers , caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually , drop by drop , into that soul , which was so virgin and so young . 
Was the fire wholly extinct there ? 
Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed ? 
The truth is , that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer . 
One day she suddenly thought of Marius : `` Why ! '' 
said she , `` I no longer think of him . '' 
That same week , she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers , with a wasp-like waist , a delicious uniform , the cheeks of a young girl , a sword under his arm , waxed mustaches , and a glazed schapka , passing the gate . 
Moreover , he had light hair , prominent blue eyes , a round face , was vain , insolent and good-looking ; quite the reverse of Marius . 
He had a cigar in his mouth . 
Cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone . 
On the following day , she saw him pass again . 
She took note of the hour . 
From that time forth , was it chance ? 
she saw him pass nearly every day . 
The officer 's comrades perceived that there was , in that `` badly kept '' garden , behind that malicious rococo fence , a very pretty creature , who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant , -- who is not unknown to the reader , and whose name was Theodule Gillenormand , -- passed by . 
`` See here ! '' 
they said to him , `` there 's a little creature there who is making eyes at you , look . '' 
`` Have I the time , '' replied the lancer , `` to look at all the girls who look at me ? '' 
This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily towards agony , and was saying : `` If I could but see her before I die ! '' 
-- Had his wish been realized , had he beheld Cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer , he would not have been able to utter a word , and he would have expired with grief . 
Whose fault was it ? 
No one 's . 
Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide ; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again . 
Cosette was , moreover , passing through that dangerous period , the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself , in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling , as chance directs , to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine-shop : A rapid and decisive moment , critical for every orphan , be she rich or poor , for wealth does not prevent a bad choice ; misalliances are made in very high circles , real misalliance is that of souls ; and as many an unknown young man , without name , without birth , without fortune , is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas , so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent , who has polished boots and varnished words , if looked at not outside , but inside , a thing which is reserved for his wife , is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent , unclean , and vinous passions ; the post of a drinking-shop . 
What did Cosette 's soul contain ? 
Passion calmed or lulled to sleep ; something limpid , brilliant , troubled to a certain depth , and gloomy lower down . 
The image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface . 
Did a souvenir linger in the depths ? 
-- Quite at the bottom ? 
-- Possibly . 
Cosette did not know . 
A singular incident supervened . 
COSETTE 'S APPREHENSIONS During the first fortnight in April , Jean Valjean took a journey . 
This , as the reader knows , happened from time to time , at very long intervals . 
He remained absent a day or two days at the utmost . 
Where did he go ? 
No one knew , not even Cosette . 
Once only , on the occasion of one of these departures , she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read : Impasse de la Planchette . 
There he alighted , and the coach took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone . 
It was usually when money was lacking in the house that Jean Valjean took these little trips . 
So Jean Valjean was absent . 
He had said : `` I shall return in three days . '' 
That evening , Cosette was alone in the drawing-room . 
In order to get rid of her ennui , she had opened her piano-organ , and had begun to sing , accompanying herself the while , the chorus from Euryanthe : `` Hunters astray in the wood ! '' 
which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music . 
When she had finished , she remained wrapped in thought . 
All at once , it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden . 
It could not be her father , he was absent ; it could not be Toussaint , she was in bed , and it was ten o'clock at night . 
She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room , which was closed , and laid her ear against it . 
It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man , and that he was walking very softly . 
She mounted rapidly to the first floor , to her own chamber , opened a small wicket in her shutter , and peeped into the garden . 
The moon was at the full . 
Everything could be seen as plainly as by day . 
There was no one there . 
She opened the window . 
The garden was absolutely calm , and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual . 
Cosette thought that she had been mistaken . 
She thought that she had heard a noise . 
It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of Weber , which lays open before the mind terrified depths , which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest , and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight . 
She thought no more about it . 
Moreover , Cosette was not very timid by nature . 
There flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot . 
It will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove . 
There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her . 
On the following day , at an earlier hour , towards nightfall , she was strolling in the garden . 
In the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her , she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening , as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk , and not very far from her ; but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side , and she paid no heed to it . 
Besides , she could see nothing . 
She emerged from `` the thicket '' ; she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps . 
The moon , which had just risen behind her , cast Cosette 's shadow in front of her upon this lawn , as she came out from the shrubbery . 
Cosette halted in alarm . 
Beside her shadow , the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow , which was particularly startling and terrible , a shadow which had a round hat . 
It was the shadow of a man , who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery , a few paces in the rear of Cosette . 
She stood for a moment without the power to speak , or cry , or call , or stir , or turn her head . 
Then she summoned up all her courage , and turned round resolutely . 
There was no one there . 
She glanced on the ground . 
The figure had disappeared . 
She re-entered the thicket , searched the corners boldly , went as far as the gate , and found nothing . 
She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror . 
Was this another hallucination ? 
What ! 
Two days in succession ! 
One hallucination might pass , but two hallucinations ? 
The disquieting point about it was , that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom . 
Phantoms do not wear round hats . 
On the following day Jean Valjean returned . 
Cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen . 
She wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her : `` You are a little goose . '' 
Jean Valjean grew anxious . 
`` It can not be anything , '' said he . 
He left her under some pretext , and went into the garden , and she saw him examining the gate with great attention . 
During the night she woke up ; this time she was sure , and she distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window . 
She ran to her little wicket and opened it . 
In point of fact , there was a man in the garden , with a large club in his hand . 
Just as she was about to scream , the moon lighted up the man 's profile . 
It was her father . 
She returned to her bed , saying to herself : `` He is very uneasy ! '' 
Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden . 
Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter . 
On the third night , the moon was on the wane , and had begun to rise later ; at one o'clock in the morning , possibly , she heard a loud burst of laughter and her father 's voice calling her : -- `` Cosette ! '' 
She jumped out of bed , threw on her dressing-gown , and opened her window . 
Her father was standing on the grass-plot below . 
`` I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you , '' said he ; `` look , there is your shadow with the round hat . '' 
And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon , and which did indeed , bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat . 
It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of sheet iron , with a hood , which rose above a neighboring roof . 
Cosette joined in his laughter , all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed , and the next morning , as she was at breakfast with her father , she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney-pots . 
Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more ; as for Cosette , she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen , or thought she had seen , and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky . 
She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot which is afraid of being caught in the act , and which retires when some one looks at its shadow , for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette had turned round , and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this . 
Cosette 's serenity was fully restored . 
The proof appeared to her to be complete , and it quite vanished from her mind , whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night . 
A few days later , however , a fresh incident occurred . 
ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT In the garden , near the railing on the street , there was a stone bench , screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms , but which could , in case of necessity , be reached by an arm from the outside , past the trees and the gate . 
One evening during that same month of April , Jean Valjean had gone out ; Cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown . 
The breeze was blowing briskly in the trees , Cosette was meditating ; an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little , that invincible sadness evoked by the evening , and which arises , perhaps , who knows , from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour . 
Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow . 
Cosette rose , slowly made the tour of the garden , walking on the grass drenched in dew , and saying to herself , through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged : `` Really , one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour . 
One takes cold . '' 
She returned to the bench . 
As she was about to resume her seat there , she observed on the spot which she had quitted , a tolerably large stone which had , evidently , not been there a moment before . 
Cosette gazed at the stone , asking herself what it meant . 
All at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself , that some one had placed it there , that an arm had been thrust through the railing , and this idea appeared to alarm her . 
This time , the fear was genuine ; the stone was there . 
No doubt was possible ; she did not touch it , fled without glancing behind her , took refuge in the house , and immediately closed with shutter , bolt , and bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps .
