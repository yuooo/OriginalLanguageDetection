There were not more than twenty paces between the two . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` I will not assassinate you ; if you will not fire upon me , surrender ! 
what is a prison ? '' 
`` I would rather die ! '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` I shall suffer less . '' 
D'Artagnan , drunk with despair , hurled his pistol to the ground . 
`` I will take you alive ! '' 
said he ; and by a prodigy of skill which this incomparable horseman alone was capable , he threw his horse forward to within ten paces of the white horse ; already his hand was stretched out to seize his prey . 
`` Kill me ! 
kill me ! '' 
cried Fouquet , '' ` twould be more humane ! '' 
`` No ! 
alive - alive ! '' 
murmured the captain . 
At this moment his horse made a false step for the second time , and Fouquet 's again took the lead . 
It was an unheard-of spectacle , this race between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their riders . 
It might be said that D'Artagnan rode , carrying his horse along between his knees . 
To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot , and that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all . 
But the chase appeared equally warm in the two fatigued athletoe . 
D'Artagnan , quite in despair , seized his second pistol , and cocked it . 
`` At your horse ! 
not at you ! '' 
cried he to Fouquet . 
And he fired . 
The animal was hit in the quarters - he made a furious bound , and plunged forward . 
At that moment D'Artagnan 's horse fell dead . 
`` I am dishonored ! '' 
thought the musketeer ; `` I am a miserable wretch ! 
for pity 's sake , M. Fouquet , throw me one of your pistols , that I may blow out my brains ! '' 
But Fouquet rode away . 
`` For mercy 's sake ! 
for mercy 's sake ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` that which you will not do at this moment , I myself will do within an hour , but here , upon this road , I should die bravely ; I should die esteemed ; do me that service , M. Fouquet ! '' 
M. Fouquet made no reply , but continued to trot on . 
D'Artagnan began to run after his enemy . 
Successively he threw away his hat , his coat , which embarrassed him , and then the sheath of his sword , which got between his legs as he was running . 
The sword in his hand itself became too heavy , and he threw it after the sheath . 
The white horse began to rattle in its throat ; D'Artagnan gained upon him . 
From a trot the exhausted animal sunk to a staggering walk - the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood . 
D'Artagnan made a desperate effort , sprang towards Fouquet , and seized him by the leg , saying in a broken , breathless voice , `` I arrest you in the king 's name ! 
blow my brains out , if you like ; we have both done our duty . '' 
Fouquet hurled far from him , into the river , the two pistols D'Artagnan might have seized , and dismounting from his horse - `` I am your prisoner , monsieur , '' said he ; `` will you take my arm , for I see you are ready to faint ? '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan , who , in fact , felt the earth sliding from under his feet , and the light of day turning to blackness around him ; then he rolled upon the sand , without breath or strength . 
Fouquet hastened to the brink of the river , dipped some water in his hat , with which he bathed the temples of the musketeer , and introduced a few drop between his lips . 
D'Artagnan raised himself with difficulty , and looked about him with a wandering eye . 
He beheld Fouquet on his knees , with his wet hat in his hand , smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness . 
`` You are not off , then ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
the true king of royalty , in heart , in soul , is not Louis of the Louvre , or Philippe of Sainte - Marguerite ; it is you , proscribed , condemned ! '' 
`` I , who this day am ruined by a single error , M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` What , in the name of Heaven , is that ? '' 
`` I should have had you for a friend ! 
But how shall we return to Nantes ? 
We are a great way from it . '' 
`` That is true , '' said D'Artagnan , gloomily . 
`` The white horse will recover , perhaps ; he is a good horse ! 
Mount , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; I will walk till you have rested a little . '' 
`` Poor beast ! 
and wounded , too ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` He will go , I tell you ; I know him ; but we can do better still , let us both get up , and ride slowly . '' 
`` We can try , '' said the captain . 
But they had scarcely charged the animal with this double load , when he began to stagger , and then with a great effort walked a few minutes , then staggered again , and sank down dead by the side of the black horse , which he had just managed to come up to . 
`` We will go on foot - destiny wills it so - the walk will be pleasant , '' said Fouquet , passing his arm through that of D'Artagnan . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
cried the latter , with a fixed eye , a contracted brow , and a swelling heart - `` What a disgraceful day ! '' 
They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting . 
When Fouquet perceived that sinister machine , he said to D'Artagnan , who cast down his eyes , ashamed of Louis XIV. , `` There is an idea that did not emanate from a brave man , Captain d'Artagnan ; it is not yours . 
What are these gratings for ? '' 
said he . 
`` To prevent your throwing letters out . '' 
`` Ingenious ! '' 
`` But you can speak , if you can not write , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Can I speak to you ? '' 
`` Why , certainly , if you wish to do so . '' 
Fouquet reflected for a moment , then looking the captain full in the face , `` One single word , '' said he ; `` will you remember it ? '' 
`` I will not forget it . '' 
`` Will you speak it to whom I wish ? '' 
`` I will . '' 
`` Saint-Mande , '' articulated Fouquet , in a low voice . 
`` Well ! 
and for whom ? '' 
`` For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson . '' 
`` It shall be done . '' 
The carriage rolled through Nantes , and took the route to Angers . 
: In Which the Squirrel Falls , - the Adder Flies . 
It was two o'clock in the afternoon . 
The king , full of impatience , went to his cabinet on the terrace , and kept opening the door of the corridor , to see what his secretaries were doing . 
M. Colbert , seated in the same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning , was chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne . 
The king opened the door suddenly , and addressed them . 
`` What is it you are saying ? '' 
`` We were speaking of the first sitting of the States , '' said M. de Brienne , rising . 
`` Very well , '' replied the king , and returned to his room . 
Five minutes after , the summons of the bell recalled Rose , whose hour it was . 
`` Have you finished your copies ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` See if M. d'Artagnan has returned . '' 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` It is very strange , '' murmured the king . 
`` Call M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert entered ; he had been expecting this all the morning . 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' said the king , very sharply ; `` you must ascertain what has become of M. d'Artagnan . '' 
Colbert in his calm voice replied , `` Where does your majesty desire him to be sought for ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur ! 
do you not know on what I have sent him ? '' 
replied Louis , acrimoniously . 
`` Your majesty did not inform me . '' 
`` Monsieur , there are things that must be guessed ; and you , above all , are apt to guess them . '' 
`` I might have been able to imagine , sire ; but I do not presume to be positive . '' 
Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the monarch and his clerk . 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , with evident joy . 
D'Artagnan , pale and in evidently bad humor , cried to the king , as he entered , `` Sire , is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
said the king . 
`` About M. Fouquet 's house ? '' 
`` None ! '' 
replied Louis . 
`` Ha ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , biting his mustache ; `` I was not mistaken , then ; it was monsieur here ; '' and he pointed to Colbert . 
`` What orders ? 
Let me know , '' said the king . 
`` Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy , to beat M. Fouquet 's servants , to force the drawers , to give over a peaceful house to pillage ! 
Mordioux ! 
these are savage orders ! '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert , turning pale . 
`` Monsieur , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` the king alone , understand , - the king alone has a right to command my musketeers ; but , as to you , I forbid you to do it , and I tell you so before his majesty ; gentlemen who carry swords do not sling pens behind their ears . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! 
D'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` It is humiliating , '' continued the musketeer ; `` my soldiers are disgraced . 
I do not command reitres , thank you , nor clerks of the intendant , mordioux ! '' 
`` Well ! 
but what is all this about ? '' 
said the king with authority . 
`` About this , sire ; monsieur - monsieur , who could not guess your majesty 's orders , and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M. Fouquet ; monsieur , who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for his patron of yesterday - has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of M. Fouquet , and , under the pretense of securing the surintendant 's papers , they have taken away the furniture . 
My musketeers have been posted round the house all the morning ; such were my orders . 
Why did any one presume to order them to enter ? 
Why , by forcing them to assist in this pillage , have they been made accomplices in it ? 
Mordioux ! 
we serve the king , we do ; but we do not serve M. Colbert ! '' 
-LRB- 5 -RRB- `` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the king , sternly , `` take care ; it is not in my presence that such explanations , and made in such a tone , should take place . '' 
`` I have acted for the good of the king , '' said Colbert , in a faltering voice . 
`` It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty 's officers , and that without redress , on account of the respect I owe the king . '' 
`` The respect you owe the king , '' cried D'Artagnan , his eyes flashing fire , `` consists , in the first place , in making his authority respected , and his person beloved . 
Every agent of a power without control represents that power , and when people curse the hand which strikes them , it is the royal hand that God reproaches , do you hear ? 
Must a soldier , hardened by forty years of wounds and blood , give you this lesson , monsieur ? 
Must mercy be on my side , and ferocity on yours ? 
You have caused the innocent to be arrested , bound , and imprisoned ! '' 
`` Accomplices , perhaps , of M. Fouquet , '' said Colbert . 
`` Who told you M. Fouquet had accomplices , or even that he was guilty ? 
The king alone knows that ; his justice is not blind ! 
When he says , ` Arrest and imprison ' such and such a man , he is obeyed . 
Do not talk to me , then , any more of the respect you owe the king , and be careful of your words , that they may not chance to convey the slightest menace ; for the king will not allow those to be threatened who do him service by others who do him disservice ; and if in case I should have , which God forbid ! 
a master so ungrateful , I would make myself respected . '' 
Thus saying , D'Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king 's cabinet , his eyes flashing , his hand on his sword , his lips trembling , affecting much more anger than he really felt . 
Colbert , humiliated and devoured with rage , bowed to the king as if to ask his permission to leave the room . 
The king , thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity , knew not which part to take . 
D'Artagnan saw him hesitate . 
To remain longer would have been a mistake : it was necessary to score a triumph over Colbert , and the only method was to touch the king so near the quick , that his majesty would have no other means of extrication but choosing between the two antagonists . 
D'Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done ; but the king , who , in preference to everything else , was anxious to have all the exact details of the arrest of the surintendant of the finances from him who had made him tremble for a moment , - the king , perceiving that the ill-humor of D'Artagnan would put off for half an hour at least the details he was burning to be acquainted with , - Louis , we say , forgot Colbert , who had nothing new to tell him , and recalled his captain of the musketeers . 
`` In the first place , '' said he , `` let me see the result of your commission , monsieur ; you may rest yourself hereafter . '' 
D'Artagnan , who was just passing through the doorway , stopped at the voice of the king , retraced his steps , and Colbert was forced to leave the closet . 
His countenance assumed almost a purple hue , his black and threatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick brows ; he stepped out , bowed before the king , half drew himself up in passing D'Artagnan , and went away with death in his heart . 
D'Artagnan , on being left alone with the king , softened immediately , and composing his countenance : `` Sire , '' said he , `` you are a young king . 
It is by the dawn that people judge whether the day will be fine or dull . 
How , sire , will the people , whom the hand of God has placed under your law , argue of your reign , if between them and you , you allow angry and violent ministers to interpose their mischief ? 
But let us speak of myself , sire , let us leave a discussion that may appear idle , and perhaps inconvenient to you . 
Let us speak of myself . 
I have arrested M. Fouquet . '' 
`` You took plenty of time about it , '' said the king , sharply . 
D'Artagnan looked at the king . 
`` I perceive that I have expressed myself badly . 
I announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` You did ; and what then ? '' 
`` Well ! 
I ought to have told your majesty that M. Fouquet had arrested me ; that would have been more just . 
I re-establish the truth , then ; I have been arrested by M. Fouquet . '' 
It was now the turn of Louis XIV . 
to be surprised . 
His majesty was astonished in his turn . 
D'Artagnan , with his quick glance , appreciated what was passing in the heart of his master . 
He did not allow him time to put any questions . 
He related , with that poetry , that picturesqueness , which perhaps he alone possessed at that period , the escape of Fouquet , the pursuit , the furious race , and , lastly , the inimitable generosity of the surintendant , who might have fled ten times over , who might have killed the adversary in the pursuit , but who had preferred imprisonment , perhaps worse , to the humiliation of one who wished to rob him of his liberty . 
In proportion as the tale advanced , the king became agitated , devouring the narrator 's words , and drumming with his finger-nails upon the table . 
`` It results from all this , sire , in my eyes , at least , that the man who conducts himself thus is a gallant man , and can not be an enemy to the king . 
That is my opinion , and I repeat it to your majesty . 
I know what the king will say to me , and I bow to it , - reasons of state . 
So be it ! 
To my ears that sounds highly respectable . 
But I am a soldier , and I have received my orders , my orders are executed - very unwillingly on my part , it is true , but they are executed . 
I say no more . '' 
`` Where is M. Fouquet at this moment ? '' 
asked Louis , after a short silence . 
`` M. Fouquet , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` is in the iron cage that M. Colbert had prepared for him , and is galloping as fast as four strong horses can drag him , towards Angers . '' 
`` Why did you leave him on the road ? '' 
`` Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers . 
The proof , the best proof of what I advance , is that the king desired me to be sought for but this minute . 
And then I had another reason . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Whilst I was with him , poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the king , astonished . 
`` Your majesty ought to understand , and does understand , certainly , that my warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty . 
I have given him one of my brigadiers , the most stupid I could find among my musketeers , in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping . '' 
`` Are you mad , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
cried the king , crossing his arms on his breast . 
`` Do people utter such enormities , even when they have the misfortune to think them ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
sire , you can not expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet , after what he has just done for you and me . 
No , no ; if you desire that he should remain under your lock and bolt , never give him in charge to me ; however closely wired might be the cage , the bird would , in the end , take wing . '' 
`` I am surprised , '' said the king , in his sternest tone , `` you did not follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne . 
You had in him all you want - affection , gratitude . 
In my service , monsieur , you will only find a master . '' 
`` If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , with a deeply impressive manner , `` one single man would have gone there , and I should have been that man - you know that right well , sire . '' 
The king was brought to a pause . 
Before that speech of his captain of the musketeers , so frankly spoken and so true , the king had nothing to offer . 
On hearing D'Artagnan , Louis remembered the D'Artagnan of former times ; him who , at the Palais Royal , held himself concealed behind the curtains of his bed , when the people of Paris , led by Cardinal de Retz , came to assure themselves of the presence of the king ; the D'Artagnan whom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage , when repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris ; the soldier who had quitted his service at Blois ; the lieutenant he had recalled to be beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power ; the man he had always found loyal , courageous , devoted . 
Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert . 
Colbert had not left the corridor where the secretaries were at work . 
He reappeared . 
`` Colbert , did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` What has it produced ? '' 
`` M. de Roncherolles , who was sent with your majesty 's musketeers , has remitted me some papers , '' replied Colbert . 
`` I will look at them . 
Give me your hand . '' 
`` My hand , sire ! '' 
`` Yes , that I may place it in that of M. d'Artagnan . 
In fact , M. d'Artagnan , '' added he , with a smile , turning towards the soldier , who , at sight of the clerk , had resumed his haughty attitude , `` you do not know this man ; make his acquaintance . '' 
And he pointed to Colbert . 
`` He has been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions , but he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
stammered Colbert , confused with pleasure and fear . 
`` I always understood why , '' murmured D'Artagnan in the king 's ear ; `` he was jealous . '' 
`` Precisely , and his jealousy confined his wings . '' 
`` He will henceforward be a winged-serpent , '' grumbled the musketeer , with a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary . 
But Colbert , approaching him , offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear ; he appeared so good , so mild , so easy ; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble , that D'Artagnan , a connoisseur in physiognomies , was moved , and almost changed in his convictions . 
Colbert pressed his hand . 
`` That which the king has just told you , monsieur , proves how well his majesty is acquainted with men . 
The inveterate opposition I have displayed , up to this day , against abuses and not against men , proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign , for my country a great blessing . 
I have many ideas , M. d'Artagnan . 
You will see them expand in the sun of public peace ; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men , I am at least certain , monsieur , that I shall obtain their esteem . 
For their admiration , monsieur , I would give my life . '' 
This change , this sudden elevation , this mute approbation of the king , gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection . 
He bowed civilly to Colbert , who did not take his eyes off him . 
The king , when he saw they were reconciled , dismissed them . 
They left the room together . 
As soon as they were out of the cabinet , the new minister , stopping the captain , said : `` Is it possible , M. d'Artagnan , that with such an eye as yours , you did not , at the first glance , at the first impression , discover what sort of man I am ? '' 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' replied the musketeer , `` a ray of the sun in our eyes prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame . 
The man in power radiates , you know ; and since you are there , why should you continue to persecute him who had just fallen into disgrace , and fallen from such a height ? '' 
`` I , monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert ; `` oh , monsieur ! 
I would never persecute him . 
I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone , because I am ambitious , and , above all , because I have the most entire confidence in my own merit ; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes , and I love to look at the king 's gold ; because , if I live thirty years , in thirty years not a denir of it will remain in my hands ; because , with that gold , I will build granaries , castles , cities , and harbors ; because I will create a marine , I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people ; because I will create libraries and academies ; because I will make France the first country in the world , and the wealthiest . 
These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet , who prevented my acting . 
And then , when I shall be great and strong , when France is great and strong , in my turn , then , will I cry , ` Mercy ' ! '' 
`` Mercy , did you say ? 
then ask his liberty of the king . 
The king is only crushing him on your account . '' 
Colbert again raised his head . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you know that is not so , and that the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet ; it is not for me to teach you that . '' 
`` But the king will grow tired ; he will forget . '' 
`` The king never forgets , M. d'Artagnan . 
Hark ! 
the king calls . 
He is going to issue an order . 
I have not influenced him , have I ? 
Listen . '' 
The king , in fact , was calling his secretaries . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he . 
`` I am here , sire . '' 
`` Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan , to form a guard for M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks . 
`` And from Angers , '' continued the king , `` they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile , in Paris . '' 
`` You were right , '' said the captain to the minister . 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' continued the king , `` you will have any one shot who shall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet , during the journey . '' 
`` But myself , sire , '' said the duke . 
`` You , monsieur , you will only speak to him in the presence of the musketeers . '' 
The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission . 
D'Artagnan was about to retire likewise ; but the king stopped him . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you will go immediately , and take possession of the isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . 
Alone ? '' 
`` You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay , in case the place should be contumacious . '' 
A murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers . 
`` That shall be done , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I saw the place in my infancy , '' resumed the king , `` and I do not wish to see it again . 
You have heard me ? 
Go , monsieur , and do not return without the keys . '' 
Colbert went up to D'Artagnan . 
`` A commission which , if you carry it out well , '' said he , `` will be worth a marechal 's baton to you . '' 
`` Why do you employ the words , ` if you carry it out well ' ? '' 
`` Because it is difficult . '' 
`` Ah ! 
in what respect ? '' 
`` You have friends in Belle-Isle , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; and it is not an easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to obtain success . '' 
D'Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought , whilst Colbert returned to the king . 
A quarter of an hour after , the captain received the written order from the king , to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle , in case of resistance , with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or refugees , and an injunction not to allow one to escape . 
`` Colbert was right , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` for me the baton of a marechal of France will cost the lives of my two friends . 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds , and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings . 
I will show them that hand so plainly , that they will have quite time enough to see it . 
Poor Porthos ! 
Poor Aramis ! 
No ; my fortune should shall not cost your wings a feather . '' 
Having thus determined , D'Artagnan assembled the royal army , embarked it at Paimboeuf , and set sail , without the loss of an unnecessary minute . 
: Belle-Ile-en-Mer . 
At the extremity of the mole , against which the furious sea beats at the evening tide , two men , holding each other by the arm , were conversing in an animated and expansive tone , without the possibility of any other human being hearing their words , borne away , as they were , one by one , by the gusts of wind , with the white foam swept from the crests of the waves . 
The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned ocean , like a gigantic crucible . 
From time to time , one of these men , turning towards the east , cast an anxious , inquiring look over the sea . 
The other , interrogating the features of his companion , seemed to seek for information in his looks . 
Then , both silent , busied with dismal thoughts , they resumed their walk . 
Every one has already perceived that these two men were our proscribed heroes , Porthos and Aramis , who had taken refuge in Belle-Isle , since the ruin of their hopes , since the discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d'Herblay . 
`` If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary , my dear Aramis , '' repeated Porthos , inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he charged his massive chest , `` It is of no use , Aramis . 
The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary circumstance . 
There has been no storm at sea ; the weather has been constantly calm , not even the lightest gale ; and even if we had had a tempest , all our boats would not have foundered . 
I repeat , it is strange . 
This complete disappearance astonishes me , I tell you . '' 
`` True , '' murmured Aramis . 
`` You are right , friend Porthos ; it is true , there is something strange in it . '' 
`` And further , '' added Porthos , whose ideas the assent of the bishop of Vannes seemed to enlarge ; `` and , further , do you not observe that if the boats have perished , not a single plank has washed ashore ? '' 
`` I have remarked it as well as yourself . '' 
`` And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in the whole island , and which I sent in search of the others - '' Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry , and by so sudden a movement , that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied . 
`` What do you say , Porthos ? 
What ! 
- You have sent the two boats - '' `` In search of the others ! 
Yes , to be sure I have , '' replied Porthos , calmly . 
`` Unhappy man ! 
What have you done ? 
Then we are indeed lost , '' cried the bishop . 
`` Lost ! 
- what did you say ? '' 
exclaimed the terrified Porthos . 
`` How lost , Aramis ? 
How are we lost ? '' 
Aramis bit his lips . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
Your pardon , I meant to say - '' `` What ? '' 
`` That if we were inclined - if we took a fancy to make an excursion by sea , we could not . '' 
`` Very good ! 
and why should that vex you ? 
A precious pleasure , ma foi ! 
For my part , I do n't regret it at all . 
What I regret is certainly not the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle : what I regret , Aramis , is Pierrefonds ; Bracieux ; le Vallon ; beautiful France ! 
Here , we are not in France , my dear friend ; we are - I know not where . 
Oh ! 
I tell you , in full sincerity of soul , and your affection will excuse my frankness , but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle . 
No ; in good truth , I am not happy ! '' 
Aramis breathed a long , but stifled sigh . 
`` Dear friend , '' replied he : `` that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago . 
If you had not sent them away , we would have departed . '' '' 
` Departed ! ' 
And the orders , Aramis ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
Why , the orders you have been constantly , in and out of season , repeating to me - that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper . 
You know very well ! '' 
`` That is true ! '' 
murmured Aramis again . 
`` You see , then , plainly , my friend , that we could not depart ; and that the sending away of the boats in search of the others can not prove prejudicial to us in the very least . '' 
Aramis was silent ; and his vague glances , luminous as that of an albatross , hovered for a long time over the sea , interrogating space , seeking to pierce the very horizon . 
`` With all that , Aramis , '' continued Porthos , who adhered to his idea , and that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it , - `` with all that , you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these unfortunate boats . 
I am assailed by cries and complaints whichever way I go . 
The children cry to see the desolation of the women , as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers . 
What do you suppose , my friend , and how ought I to answer them ? '' 
`` Think all you like , my good Porthos , and say nothing . '' 
This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all . 
He turned away grumbling something in ill-humor . 
Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer . 
`` Do you remember , '' said he , in a melancholy tone , kneading the two hands of the giant between his own with affectionate cordiality , `` do you remember , my friend , that in the glorious days of youth - do you remember , Porthos , when we were all strong and valiant - we , and the other two - if we had then had an inclination to return to France , do you think this sheet of salt water would have stopped us ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` but six leagues . '' 
`` If you had seen me get astride of a plank , would you have remained on land , Porthos ? '' 
`` No , pardieu ! 
No , Aramis . 
But , nowadays , what sort of a plank should we want , my friend ! 
I , in particular . '' 
And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh . 
`` And do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little , and that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling - of your episcopal palace , at Vannes ? 
Come , confess . '' 
`` No , '' replied Aramis , without daring to look at Porthos . 
`` Let us stay where we are , then , '' said his friend , with a sigh , which , in spite of the efforts he made to restrain it , escaped his echoing breast . 
`` Let us remain ! 
- let us remain ! 
And yet , '' added he , `` and yet , if we seriously wished , but that decidedly - if we had a fixed idea , one firmly taken , to return to France , and there were not boats - '' `` Have you remarked another thing , my friend - that is , since the disappearance of our barks , during the last two days ' absence of fishermen , not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the isle ? '' 
`` Yes , certainly ! 
you are right . 
I , too , have remarked it , and the observation was the more naturally made , for , before the last two fatal days , barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps . '' 
`` I must inquire , '' said Aramis , suddenly , and with great agitation . 
`` And then , if we had a raft constructed - '' `` But there are some canoes , my friend ; shall I board one ? '' 
`` A canoe ! 
- a canoe ! 
Can you think of such a thing , Porthos ? 
A canoe to be upset in . 
No , no , '' said the bishop of Vannes ; `` it is not our trade to ride upon the waves . 
We will wait , we will wait . '' 
And Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation . 
Porthos , who grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his friend - Porthos , who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of the sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his companion 's continual convulsive starts - Porthos stopped him . 
`` Let us sit down upon this rock , '' said he . 
`` Place yourself there , close to me , Aramis , and I conjure you , for the last time , to explain to me in a manner I can comprehend - explain to me what we are doing here . '' 
`` Porthos , '' said Aramis , much embarrassed . 
`` I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king . 
That is a fact , that I understand . 
Well - '' `` Yes ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to the English . 
I understand that , too . '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into Belle-Isle to take direction of the works , and the command of ten companies levied and paid by M. Fouquet , or rather the ten companies of his son-in-law . 
All that is plain . '' 
Aramis rose in a state of great impatience . 
He might be said to be a lion importuned by a gnat . 
Porthos held him by the arm . 
`` But what I can not understand , what , in spite of all the efforts of my mind , and all my reflections , I can not comprehend , and never shall comprehend , is , that instead of sending us troops , instead of sending us reinforcements of men , munitions , provisions , they leave us without boats , they leave Belle - Isle without arrivals , without help ; it is that instead of establishing with us a correspondence , whether by signals , or written or verbal communications , all relations with the shore are intercepted . 
Tell me , Aramis , answer me , or rather , before answering me , will you allow me to tell you what I have thought ? 
Will you hear what my idea is , the plan I have conceived ? '' 
The bishop raised his head . 
`` Well ! 
Aramis , '' continued Porthos , `` I have dreamed , I have imagined that an event has taken place in France . 
I dreamt of M. Fouquet all the night , of lifeless fish , of broken eggs , of chambers badly furnished , meanly kept . 
Villainous dreams , my dear D'Herblay ; very unlucky , such dreams ! '' 
`` Porthos , what is that yonder ? '' 
interrupted Aramis , rising suddenly , and pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the water . 
`` A bark ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` yes , it is a bark ! 
Ah ! 
we shall have some news at last . '' 
`` There are two ! '' 
cried the bishop , on discovering another mast ; `` two ! 
three ! 
four ! '' 
`` Five ! '' 
said Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Six ! 
seven ! 
Ah ! 
mon Dieu ! 
mon Dieu ! 
it is a fleet ! '' 
`` Our boats returning , probably , '' said Aramis , very uneasily , in spite of the assurance he affected . 
`` They are very large for fishing-boats , '' observed Porthos , `` and do you not remark , my friend , that they come from the Loire ? '' 
`` They come from the Loire - yes - '' `` And look ! 
everybody here sees them as well as ourselves ; look , women and children are beginning to crowd the jetty . '' 
An old fisherman passed . 
`` Are those our barks , yonder ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
The old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon . 
`` No , monseigneur , '' replied he , `` they are lighter boars , boats in the king 's service . '' 
`` Boats in the royal service ? '' 
replied Aramis , starting . 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
said he . 
`` By the flag . '' 
`` But , '' said Porthos , `` the boat is scarcely visible ; how the devil , my friend , can you distinguish the flag ? '' 
`` I see there is one , '' replied the old man ; `` our boats , trade lighters , do not carry any . 
That sort of craft is generally used for transport of troops . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
groaned Aramis . 
`` Vivat ! '' 
cried Porthos , `` they are sending us reinforcements , do n't you think they are , Aramis ? '' 
`` Probably . '' 
`` Unless it is the English coming . '' 
`` By the Loire ? 
That would have an evil look , Porthos ; for they must have come through Paris ! '' 
`` You are right ; they are reinforcements , decidedly , or provisions . '' 
Aramis leaned his head upon his hands , and made no reply . 
Then , all at once , - `` Porthos , '' said he , `` have the alarm sounded . '' 
`` The alarm ! 
do you imagine such a thing ? '' 
`` Yes , and let the cannoniers mount their batteries , the artillerymen be at their pieces , and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries . '' 
Porthos opened his eyes to their widest extent . 
He looked attentively at his friend , to convince himself he was in his proper senses . 
`` I will do it , my dear Porthos , '' continued Aramis , in his blandest tone ; `` I will go and have these orders executed myself , if you do not go , my friend . '' 
`` Well ! 
I will - instantly ! '' 
said Porthos , who went to execute the orders , casting all the while looks behind him , to see if the bishop of Vannes were not deceived ; and if , on recovering more rational ideas , he would not recall him . 
The alarm was sounded , trumpets brayed , drums rolled ; the great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry . 
The dikes and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers ; matches sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen , placed behind the large cannon bedded in their stone carriages . 
When every man was at his post , when all the preparations for defense were made : `` Permit me , Aramis , to try to comprehend , '' whispered Porthos , timidly , in Aramis 's ear . 
`` My dear friend , you will comprehend but too soon , '' murmured M. d'Herblay , in reply to this question of his lieutenant . 
`` The fleet which is coming yonder , with sails unfurled , straight towards the port of Belle-Isle , is a royal fleet , is it not ? '' 
`` But as there are two kings in France , Porthos , to which of these two kings does this fleet belong ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you open my eyes , '' replied the giant , stunned by the insinuation . 
And Porthos , whose eyes this reply of his friend 's had at last opened , or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight , went with his best speed to the batteries to overlook his people , and exhort every one to do his duty . 
In the meantime , Aramis , with his eye fixed on the horizon , saw the ships continually drawing nearer . 
The people and the soldiers , perched on the summits of the rocks , could distinguish the masts , then the lower sails , and at last the hulls of the lighters , bearing at the masthead the royal flag of France . 
It was night when one of these vessels , which had created such a sensation among the inhabitants of Belle-Isle , dropped anchor within cannon shot of the place . 
It was soon seen , notwithstanding the darkness , that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel , from the side of which a skiff was lowered , of which the three rowers , bending to their oars , took the direction of the port , and in a few instants struck land at the foot of the fort . 
The commander jumped ashore . 
He had a letter in his hand , which he waved in the air , and seemed to wish to communicate with somebody . 
This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of the pilots of the island . 
He was the captain of one of the two barks retained by Aramis , but which Porthos , in his anxiety with regard to the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared , had sent in search of the missing boats . 
He asked to be conducted to M. d'Herblay . 
Two soldiers , at a signal from a sergeant , marched him between them , and escorted him . 
Aramis was upon the quay . 
The envoy presented himself before the bishop of Vannes . 
The darkness was almost absolute , notwithstanding the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following Aramis in his rounds . 
`` Well , Jonathan , from whom do you come ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , from those who captured me . '' 
`` Who captured you ? '' 
`` You know , monseigneur , we set out in search of our comrades ? '' 
`` Yes ; and afterwards ? '' 
`` Well ! 
monseigneur , within a short league we were captured by a chasse maree belonging to the king . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Of which king ? '' 
cried Porthos . 
Jonathan started . 
`` Speak ! '' 
continued the bishop . 
`` We were captured , monseigneur , and joined to those who had been taken yesterday morning . '' 
`` What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , to prevent us from telling you , '' replied Jonathan . 
Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend . 
`` And they have released you to-day ? '' 
asked he . 
`` That I might tell you they have captured us , monsieur . '' 
`` Trouble upon trouble , '' thought honest Porthos . 
During this time Aramis was reflecting . 
`` Humph ! '' 
said he , `` then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the coasts ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Who commands it ? '' 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos . 
`` I believe that is the name . '' 
`` And did he give you this letter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Bring the torches nearer . '' 
`` It is his writing , '' said Porthos . 
Aramis eagerly read the following lines : `` Order of the king to take Belle-Isle ; or to put the garrison to the sword , if they resist ; order to make prisoners of all the men of the garrison ; signed , D'ARTAGNAN , who , the day before yesterday , arrested M. Fouquet , for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile . '' 
Aramis turned pale , and crushed the paper in his hands . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Nothing , my friend , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Jonathan ? '' 
`` Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Did you speak to M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` That for ampler information , he would speak with monseigneur . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` On board his own vessel . '' 
`` On board his vessel ! '' 
and Porthos repeated , `` On board his vessel ! '' 
`` M. le mousquetaire , '' continued Jonathan , `` told me to take you both on board my canoe , and bring you to him . '' 
`` Let us go at once , '' exclaimed Porthos . 
`` Dear D'Artagnan ! '' 
But Aramis stopped him . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Who knows that it is not a snare ? '' 
`` Of the other king 's ? '' 
said Porthos , mysteriously . 
`` A snare , in fact ! 
That 's what it is , my friend . '' 
`` Very possibly ; what is to be done , then ? 
If D'Artagnan sends for us - '' `` Who assures you that D'Artagnan sends for us ? '' 
`` Well , but - but his writing - '' `` Writing is easily counterfeited . 
This looks counterfeited - unsteady - '' `` You are always right ; but , in the meantime , we know nothing . '' 
Aramis was silent . 
`` It is true , '' said the good Porthos , `` we do not want to know anything . '' 
`` What shall I do ? '' 
asked Jonathan . 
`` You will return on board this captain 's vessel . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I comprehend ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Yes , monseigneur , '' replied Jonathan ; `` but if the captain should refuse to come to Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` If he refuses , as we have cannon , we will make use of them . '' 
`` What ! 
against D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` If it is D'Artagnan , Porthos , he will come . 
Go , Jonathan , go ! '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I no longer comprehend anything , '' murmured Porthos . 
`` I will make you comprehend it all , my dear friend ; the time for it has come ; sit down upon this gun-carriage , open your ears , and listen well to me . '' 
`` Oh ! 
pardieu ! 
I will listen , no fear of that . '' 
`` May I depart , monseigneur ? '' 
cried Jonathan . 
`` Yes , begone , and bring back an answer . 
Allow the canoe to pass , you men there ! '' 
And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet . 
Aramis took Porthos by the hand , and commenced his explanations . 
: Explanations by Aramis . 
`` What I have to say to you , friend Porthos , will probably surprise you , but it may prove instructive . '' 
`` I like to be surprised , '' said Porthos , in a kindly tone ; `` do not spare me , therefore , I beg . 
I am hardened against emotions ; do n't fear , speak out . '' 
`` It is difficult , Porthos - difficult ; for , in truth , I warn you a second time , I have very strange things , very extraordinary things , to tell you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you speak so well , my friend , that I could listen to you for days together . 
Speak , then , I beg - and - stop , I have an idea : I will , to make your task more easy , I will , to assist you in telling me such things , question you . '' 
`` I shall be pleased at your doing so . '' 
`` What are we going to fight for , Aramis ? '' 
`` If you ask me many such questions as that - if you would render my task the easier by interrupting my revelations thus , Porthos , you will not help me at all . 
So far , on the contrary , that is the very Gordian knot . 
But , my friend , with a man like you , good , generous , and devoted , the confession must be bravely made . 
I have deceived you , my worthy friend . '' 
`` You have deceived me ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
yes . '' 
`` Was it for my good , Aramis ? '' 
`` I thought so , Porthos ; I thought so sincerely , my friend . '' 
`` Then , '' said the honest seigneur of Bracieux , `` you have rendered me a service , and I thank you for it ; for if you had not deceived me , I might have deceived myself . 
In what , then , have you deceived me , tell me ? '' 
`` In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV. , at this moment , is directing his efforts . '' 
`` The usurper ! '' 
said Porthos , scratching his head . 
`` That is - well , I do not quite clearly comprehend ! '' 
`` He is one of the two kings who are contending fro the crown of France . '' 
`` Very well ! 
Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` You have hit the matter in one word . '' 
`` It follows that - '' `` It follows that we are rebels , my poor friend . '' 
`` The devil ! 
the devil ! '' 
cried Porthos , much disappointed . 
`` Oh ! 
but , dear Porthos , be calm , we shall still find means of getting out of the affair , trust me . '' 
`` It is not that which makes me uneasy , '' replied Porthos ; `` that which alone touches me is that ugly word rebels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
but - '' `` And so , according to this , the duchy that was promised me - '' `` It was the usurper that was to give it to you . '' 
`` And that is not the same thing , Aramis , '' said Porthos , majestically . 
`` My friend , if it had only depended upon me , you should have become a prince . '' 
Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way . 
`` That is where you have been wrong , '' continued he , `` in deceiving me ; for that promised duchy I reckoned upon . 
Oh ! 
I reckoned upon it seriously , knowing you to be a man of your word , Aramis . '' 
`` Poor Porthos ! 
pardon me , I implore you ! '' 
`` So , then , '' continued Porthos , without replying to the bishop 's prayer , `` so then , it seems , I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I will settle all that , my good friend , I will settle all that . 
I will take it on myself alone ! '' 
`` Aramis ! '' 
`` No , no , Porthos , I conjure you , let me act . 
No false generosity ! 
No inopportune devotedness ! 
You knew nothing of my projects . 
You have done nothing of yourself . 
With me it is different . 
I alone am the author of this plot . 
I stood in need of my inseparable companion ; I called upon you , and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device , ` All for one , one for all . ' 
My crime is that I was an egotist . '' 
`` Now , that is a word I like , '' said Porthos ; `` and seeing that you have acted entirely for yourself , it is impossible for me to blame you . 
It is natural . '' 
And upon this sublime reflection , Porthos pressed his friend 's hand cordially . 
In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul , Aramis felt his own littleness . 
It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before real superiority of heart , which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind . 
He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend . 
`` Now , '' said Porthos , `` that we have come to an explanation , now that I am perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV. , I think , my friend , it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of all this . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth . 
The king Louis XIV . 
has no longer now but one enemy : that enemy is myself , myself alone . 
I have made you a prisoner , you have followed me , to-day I liberate you , you fly back to your prince . 
You can perceive , Porthos , there is not one difficulty in all this . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` I am quite sure of it . '' 
`` Then why , '' said the admirable good sense of Porthos , `` then why , if we are in such an easy position , why , my friend , do we prepare cannon , muskets , and engines of all sorts ? 
It seems to me it would be much more simple to say to Captain d'Artagnan : ` My dear friend , we have been mistaken ; that error is to be repaired ; open the door to us , let us pass through , and we will say good-bye . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
that ! '' 
said Aramis , shaking his head . 
`` Why do you say ` that ' ? 
Do you not approve of my plan , my friend ? '' 
`` I see a difficulty in it . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` The hypothesis that D'Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us to defend ourselves . '' 
`` What ! 
defend ourselves against D'Artagnan ? 
Folly ! 
Against the good D'Artagnan ! '' 
Aramis once more replied by shaking his head . 
`` Porthos , '' at length said he , `` if I have had the matches lighted and the guns pointed , if I have had the signal of alarm sounded , if I have called every man to his post upon the ramparts , those good ramparts of Belle - Isle which you have so well fortified , it was not for nothing . 
Wait to judge ; or rather , no , do not wait - '' `` What can I do ? '' 
`` If I knew , my friend , I would have told you . '' 
`` But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves : - a boat , and away for France - where - '' `` My dear friend , '' said Aramis , smiling with a strong shade of sadness , `` do not let us reason like children ; let us be men in council and in execution . 
- But , hark ! 
I hear a hail for landing at the port . 
Attention , Porthos , serious attention ! '' 
`` It is D'Artagnan , no doubt , '' said Porthos , in a voice of thunder , approaching the parapet . 
`` Yes , it is I , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , running lightly up the steps of the mole , and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which his two friends waited for him . 
As soon as he came towards them , Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D'Artagnan , treading apparently in his very steps . 
The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole , when half-way up . 
His companions imitated him . 
`` Make your men draw back , '' cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis ; `` let them retire out of hearing . '' 
This order , given by Porthos , was executed immediately . 
Then D'Artagnan , turning towards him who followed him : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we are no longer on board the king 's fleet , where , in virtue of your order , you spoke so arrogantly to me , just now . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the officer , `` I did not speak arrogantly to you ; I simply , but rigorously , obeyed instructions . 
I was commanded to follow you . 
I follow you . 
I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do ; I am in duty bound , accordingly , to overhear your conversations . '' 
D'Artagnan trembled with rage , and Porthos and Aramis , who heard this dialogue , trembled likewise , but with uneasiness and fear . 
D'Artagnan , biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him exasperation , closely to be followed by an explosion , approached the officer . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , so much the more impressive , that , affecting calm , it threatened tempest - `` monsieur , when I sent a canoe hither , you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle . 
You produced an order to that effect ; and , in my turn , I instantly showed you the note I had written . 
When the skipper of the boat sent by me returned , when I received the reply of these two gentlemen '' -LRB- and he pointed to Aramis and Porthos -RRB- , `` you heard every word of what the messenger said . 
All that was plainly in your orders , all that was well executed , very punctually , was it not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' stammered the officer ; `` yes , without doubt , but - '' `` Monsieur , '' continued D'Artagnan , growing warm - `` monsieur , when I manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle , you demanded to accompany me ; I did not hesitate ; I brought you with me . 
You are now at Belle-Isle , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; but - '' `` But - the question no longer is of M. Colbert , who has given you that order , or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions ; the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d'Artagnan , and who is alone with M. d'Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet of salt water ; a bad position for that man , a bad position , monsieur ! 
I warn you . '' 
`` But , monsieur , if I am a restraint upon you , '' said the officer , timidly , and almost faintly , `` it is my duty which - '' `` Monsieur , you have had the misfortune , either you or those that sent you , to insult me . 
It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water . 
Oh ! 
it will happen ! 
it will happen ! 
I have only been six times angry in my life , monsieur , and all five preceding times I killed my man . '' 
The officer did not stir ; he became pale under this terrible threat , but replied with simplicity , `` Monsieur , you are wrong in acting against my orders . '' 
Porthos and Aramis , mute and trembling at the top of the parapet , cried to the musketeer , `` Good D'Artagnan , take care ! '' 
D'Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence , raised his foot with ominous calmness to mount the stair , and turned round , sword in hand , to see if the officer followed him . 
The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped up . 
Porthos and Aramis , who knew their D'Artagnan , uttered a cry , and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard . 
But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand , - `` Monsieur , '' said he to the officer , in an agitated voice , `` you are a brave man . 
You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you now . '' 
`` Speak , Monsieur d'Artagnan , speak , '' replied the officer . 
`` These gentlemen we have just seen , and against whom you have orders , are my friends . '' 
`` I know they are , monsieur . '' 
`` You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions prescribe . '' 
`` I understand your reserve . '' 
`` Very well ; permit me , then , to converse with them without a witness . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , if I yield to your request , if I do that which you beg me , I break my word ; but if I do not do it , I disoblige you . 
I prefer the one dilemma to the other . 
Converse with your friends , and do not despise me , monsieur , for doing this for your sake , whom I esteem and honor ; do not despise me for committing for you , and you alone , an unworthy act . '' 
D'Artagnan , much agitated , threw his arm round the neck of the young man , and then went up to his friends . 
The officer , enveloped in his cloak , sat down on the damp , weed-covered steps . 
`` Well ! '' 
said D'Artagnan to his friends , `` such is my position , judge for yourselves . '' 
All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth . 
`` What is the meaning of all these preparations ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not any , I assure you , my dear captain ; for , in fact , I have done nothing , no more has Aramis , '' the worthy baron hastened to say . 
D'Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate , which penetrated that hardened heart . 
`` Dear Porthos ! '' 
cried the bishop of Vannes . 
`` You see what is being done against you , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` interception of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle . 
Your means of transport seized . 
If you had endeavored to fly , you would have fallen into the hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions , on the watch for you . 
The king wants you to be taken , and he will take you . '' 
D'Artagnan tore at his gray mustache . 
Aramis grew somber , Porthos angry . 
`` My idea was this , '' continued D'Artagnan : `` to make you both come on board , to keep you near me , and restore you your liberty . 
But now , who can say , when I return to my ship , I may not find a superior ; that I may not find secret orders which will take from me my command , and give it to another , who will dispose of me and you without hope of help ? '' 
`` We must remain at Belle-Isle , '' said Aramis , resolutely ; `` and I assure you , for my part , I will not surrender easily . '' 
Porthos said nothing . 
D'Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend . 
`` I have another trial to make of this officer , of this brave fellow who accompanies me , and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy ; for it denotes an honest man , who , though an enemy , is a thousand times better than a complaisant coward . 
Let us try to learn from him what his instructions are , and what his orders permit or forbid . '' 
`` Let us try , '' said Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went to the parapet , leaned over towards the steps of the mole , and called the officer , who immediately came up . 
`` Monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other , `` monsieur , if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here , what would you do ? '' 
`` I should not oppose it , monsieur ; but having direct explicit orders to put them under guard , I should detain them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` That 's all over , '' said Aramis , gloomily . 
Porthos did not stir . 
`` But still take Porthos , '' said the bishop of Vannes . 
`` He can prove to the king , and I will help him do so , and you too , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that he had nothing to do with this affair . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Will you come ? 
Will you follow me , Porthos ? 
The king is merciful . '' 
`` I want time for reflection , '' said Porthos . 
`` You will remain here , then ? '' 
`` Until fresh orders , '' said Aramis , with vivacity . 
`` Until we have an idea , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` and I now believe that will not be long , for I have one already . '' 
`` Let us say adieu , then , '' said Aramis ; `` but in truth , my good Porthos , you ought to go . '' 
`` No , '' said the latter , laconically . 
`` As you please , '' replied Aramis , a little wounded in his susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion . 
`` Only I am reassured by the promise of an idea from D'Artagnan , an idea I fancy I have divined . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the musketeer , placing his ear near Aramis 's mouth . 
The latter spoke several words rapidly , to which D'Artagnan replied , `` That is it , precisely . '' 
`` Infallible ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` During the first emotion this resolution will cause , take care of yourself , Aramis . '' 
`` Oh ! 
do n't be afraid . '' 
`` Now , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan to the officer , `` thanks , a thousand thanks ! 
You have made yourself three friends for life . '' 
`` Yes , '' added Aramis . 
Porthos alone said nothing , but merely bowed . 
D'Artagnan , having tenderly embraced his two old friends , left Belle-Isle with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had saddled him . 
Thus , with the exception of the explanation with which the worthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied , nothing had changed in appearance in the fate of one or the other , `` Only , '' said Aramis , `` there is D'Artagnan 's idea . '' 
D'Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea he had discovered . 
Now , we know that whatever D'Artagnan did examine , according to custom , daylight was certain to illuminate . 
As to the officer , now grown mute again , he had full time for meditation . 
Therefore , on putting his foot on board his vessel , moored within cannon - shot of the island , the captain of the musketeers had already got together all his means , offensive and defensive . 
He immediately assembled his council , which consisted of the officers serving under his orders . 
These were eight in number ; a chief of the maritime forces ; a major directing the artillery ; an engineer , the officer we are acquainted with , and four lieutenants . 
Having assembled them , D'Artagnan arose , took of his hat , and addressed them thus : `` Gentlemen , I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer , and I have found in it a good and solid garrison ; moreover , preparations are made for a defense that may prove troublesome . 
I therefore intend to send for two of the principal officers of the place , that we may converse with them . 
Having separated them from their troops and cannon , we shall be better able to deal with them ; particularly by reasoning with them . 
Is not this your opinion , gentlemen ? '' 
The major of artillery rose . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , with respect , but firmness , `` I have heard you say that the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense . 
The place is then , as you know , determined on rebellion ? '' 
D'Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply ; but he was not the man to allow himself to be subdued by a trifle , and resumed : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` your reply is just . 
But you are ignorant that Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet 's , and that former monarchs gave the right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people . '' 
The major made a movement . 
`` Oh ! 
do not interrupt me , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
`` You are going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the English was not a right to arm themselves against their king . 
But it is not M. Fouquet , I suppose , who holds Belle-Isle at this moment , since I arrested M. Fouquet the day before yesterday . 
Now the inhabitants and defenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest . 
You would announce it to them in vain . 
It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary , so unexpected , that they would not believe you . 
A Breton serves his master , and not his masters ; he serves his master till he has seen him dead . 
Now the Bretons , as far as I know , have not seen the body of M. Fouquet . 
It is not , then , surprising they hold out against that which is neither M. Fouquet nor his signature . '' 
The major bowed in token of assent . 
`` That is why , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I propose to cause two of the principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel . 
They will see you , gentlemen ; they will see the forces we have at our disposal ; they will consequently know to what they have to trust , and the fate that attends them , in case of rebellion . 
We will affirm to them , upon our honor , that M. Fouquet is a prisoner , and that all resistance can only be prejudicial to them . 
We will tell them that at the first cannon fired , there will be no further hope of mercy from the king . 
Then , or so at least I trust , they will resist no longer . 
They will yield up without fighting , and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue . '' 
The officer who had followed D'Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to speak , but D'Artagnan interrupted him . 
`` Yes , I know what you are going to tell me , monsieur ; I know that there is an order of the king 's to prevent all secret communications with the defenders of Belle-Isle , and that is exactly why I do not offer to communicate except in presence of my staff . '' 
And D'Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers , who knew him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension . 
The officers looked at each other as if to read each other 's opinions in their eyes , with the intention of evidently acting , should they agree , according to the desire of D'Artagnan . 
And already the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos and Aramis , when the king 's officer drew from a pocket a folded paper , which he placed in the hands of D'Artagnan . 
This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1 . 
`` What , more ! '' 
murmured the surprised captain . 
`` Read , monsieur , '' said the officer , with a courtesy that was not free from sadness . 
D'Artagnan , full of mistrust , unfolded the paper , and read these words : `` Prohibition to M. d'Artagnan to assemble any council whatever , or to deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners shot . 
Signed - LOUIS . '' 
D'Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole body , and with a gracious smile : `` That is well , monsieur , '' said he ; `` the king 's orders shall be complied with . '' 
: Result of the Ideas of the King , and the Ideas of D'Artagnan . 
The blow was direct . 
It was severe , mortal . 
D'Artagnan , furious at having been anticipated by an idea of the king 's , did not despair , however , even yet ; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle , he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the king has charged some other than myself with his secret orders , it must be because I no longer possess his confidence , and I should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions . 
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king . 
I tender it before you all , enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of France , in such a way as not to compromise the safety of the forces his majesty has confided to me . 
For this purpose , return all to your posts ; within an hour , we shall have the ebb of the tide . 
To your posts , gentlemen ! 
I suppose , '' added he , on seeing that all prepared to obey him , except the surveillant officer , `` you have no orders to object , this time ? '' 
And D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words . 
This plan would prove the safety of his friends . 
The blockade once raised , they might embark immediately , and set sail for England or Spain , without fear of being molested . 
Whilst they were making their escape , D'Artagnan would return to the king ; would justify his return by the indignation which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him ; he would be sent back with full powers , and he would take Belle-Isle ; that is to say , the cage , after the birds had flown . 
But to this plan the officer opposed a further order of the king 's . 
It was thus conceived : `` From the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving in his resignation , he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the expedition , and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to no longer obey him . 
Moreover , the said Monsieur d'Artagnan , having lost that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle , shall set out immediately for France , accompanied by the officer who will have remitted the message to him , and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he is answerable . '' 
Brave and careless as he was , D'Artagnan turned pale . 
Everything had been calculated with a depth of precognition which , for the first time in thirty years , recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible logic of the great cardinal . 
He leaned his head on his hand , thoughtful , scarcely breathing . 
`` If I were to put this order in my pocket , '' thought he , `` who would know it , what would prevent my doing it ? 
Before the king had had time to be informed , I should have saved those poor fellows yonder . 
Let us exercise some small audacity ! 
My head is not one of those the executioner strikes off for disobedience . 
We will disobey ! '' 
But at the moment he was about to adopt this plan , he saw the officers around him reading similar orders , which the passive agent of the thoughts of that infernal Colbert had distributed to them . 
This contingency of his disobedience had been foreseen - as all the rest had been . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the officer , coming up to him , `` I await your good pleasure to depart . '' 
`` I am ready , monsieur , '' replied D'Artagnan , grinding his teeth . 
The officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d'Artagnan and himself . 
At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage . 
`` How , '' stammered he , `` will you carry on the directions of the different corps ? '' 
`` When you are gone , monsieur , '' replied the commander of the fleet , `` it is to me the command of the whole is committed . '' 
`` Then , monsieur , '' rejoined Colbert 's man , addressing the new leader , `` it is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended . 
Let us see your powers . '' 
`` Here they are , '' said the officer , exhibiting the royal signature . 
`` Here are your instructions , '' replied the officer , placing the folded paper in his hands ; and turning round towards D'Artagnan , `` Come , monsieur , '' said he , in an agitated voice -LRB- such despair did he behold in that man of iron -RRB- , `` do me the favor to depart at once . '' 
`` Immediately ! '' 
articulated D'Artagnan , feebly , subdued , crushed by implacable impossibility . 
And he painfully subsided into the little boat , which started , favored by wind and tide , for the coast of France . 
The king 's guards embarked with him . 
The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes quickly , and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough to incline the king to mercy . 
The bark flew like a swallow . 
D'Artagnan distinctly saw the land of France profiled in black against the white clouds of night . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , to the officer to whom , for an hour , he had ceased speaking , `` what would I give to know the instructions for the new commander ! 
They are all pacific , are they not ? 
and - '' He did not finish ; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the waves , another , and two or three still louder . 
D'Artagnan shuddered . 
`` They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle , '' replied the officer . 
The canoe had just touched the soil of France . 
: The Ancestors of Porthos . 
When D'Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos , the latter returned to the principal fort , in order to converse with greater liberty . 
Porthos , still thoughtful , was a restraint on Aramis , whose mind had never felt itself more free . 
`` Dear Porthos , '' said he , suddenly , `` I will explain D'Artagnan 's idea to you . '' 
`` What idea , Aramis ? '' 
`` An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours . '' 
`` Ah ! 
indeed ! '' 
said Porthos , much astonished . 
`` Let us hear it . '' 
`` Did you remark , in the scene our friend had with the officer , that certain orders constrained him with regard to us ? '' 
`` Yes , I did notice that . '' 
`` Well ! 
D'Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king , and during the confusion that will result from his absence , we will get away , or rather you will get away , Porthos , if there is possibility of flight for only one . '' 
Here Porthos shook his head and replied : `` We will escape together , Aramis , or we will stay together . '' 
`` Thine is a right , a generous heart , '' said Aramis , `` only your melancholy uneasiness affects me . '' 
`` I am not uneasy , '' said Porthos . 
`` Then you are angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you . '' 
`` Then why , my friend , do you put on such a dismal countenance ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; I am making my will . '' 
And while saying these words , the good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis . 
`` Your will ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
`` What , then ! 
do you think yourself lost ? '' 
`` I feel fatigued . 
It is the first time , and there is a custom in our family . '' 
`` What is it , my friend ? '' 
`` My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` then your grandfather must have been Samson himself . '' 
`` No ; his name was Antoine . 
Well ! 
he was about my age , when , setting out one day for the chase , he felt his legs weak , the man who had never known what weakness was before . '' 
`` What was the meaning of that fatigue , my friend ? '' 
`` Nothing good , as you will see ; for having set out , complaining still of weakness of the legs , he met a wild boar , which made head against him ; he missed him with his arquebuse , and was ripped up by the beast and died immediately . '' 
`` There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself , dear Porthos . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you will see . 
My father was as strong again as I am . 
He was a rough soldier , under Henry III . 
and Henry IV. ; his name was not Antoine , but Gaspard , the same as M. de Coligny . 
Always on horseback , he had never known what lassitude was . 
One evening , as he rose from table , his legs failed him . '' 
`` He had supped heartily , perhaps , '' said Aramis , `` and that was why he staggered . '' 
`` Bah ! 
A friend of M. de Bassompierre , nonsense ! 
No , no , he was astonished at this lassitude , and said to my mother , who laughed at him , ` Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar , as the late M. du Vallon , my father did ? ' '' 
`` Well ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Well , having this weakness , my father insisted upon going down into the garden , instead of going to bed ; his foot slipped on the first stair , the staircase was steep ; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed . 
The hinge gashed his temple ; and he was stretched out dead upon the spot . '' 
Aramis raised his eyes to his friend : `` These are two extraordinary circumstances , '' said he ; `` let us not infer that there may succeed a third . 
It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious , my brave Porthos . 
Besides , when were your legs known to fail ? 
Never have you stood so firm , so haughtily ; why , you could carry a house on your shoulders . '' 
`` At this moment , '' said Porthos , `` I feel myself pretty active ; but at times I vacillate ; I sink ; and lately this phenomenon , as you say , has occurred four times . 
I will not say this frightens me , but it annoys me . 
Life is an agreeable thing . 
I have money ; I have fine estates ; I have horses that I love ; I have also friends that I love : D'Artagnan , Athos , Raoul , and you . '' 
The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship . 
Aramis pressed his hand : `` We will still live many years , '' said he , `` to preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men . 
Trust yourself to me , my friend ; we have no reply from D'Artagnan , that is a good sign . 
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas . 
On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! '' 
`` That is a grand idea . 
What shall we gain by it ? '' 
`` We shall gain this - nobody knows that grotto , or rather its issue , except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island ; we shall gain this - that if the island is occupied , the scouts , seeing no bark upon the shore , will never imagine we can escape , and will cease to watch . '' 
`` I understand . '' 
`` Well ! 
that weakness in the legs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
better , much , just now . '' 
`` You see , then , plainly , that everything conspires to give us quietude and hope . 
D'Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free . 
No royal fleet or descent to be dreaded . 
Vive Dieu ! 
Porthos , we have still half a century of magnificent adventure before us , and if I once touch Spanish ground , I swear to you , '' added the bishop with terrible energy , `` that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be . '' 
`` We live by hope , '' said Porthos , enlivened by the warmth of his companion . 
All at once a cry resounded in their ears : `` To arms ! 
to arms ! '' 
This cry , repeated by a hundred throats , piercing the chamber where the two friends were conversing , carried surprise to one , and uneasiness to the other . 
Aramis opened the window ; he saw a crowd of people running with flambeaux . 
Women were seeking places of safety , the armed population were hastening to their posts . 
`` The fleet ! 
the fleet ! '' 
cried a soldier , who recognized Aramis . 
`` The fleet ? '' 
repeated the latter . 
`` Within half cannon-shot , '' continued the soldier . 
`` To arms ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` To arms ! '' 
repeated Porthos , formidably . 
And both rushed forth towards the mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries .
