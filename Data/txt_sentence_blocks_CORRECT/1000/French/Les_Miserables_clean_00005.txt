Nevertheless , it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them . 
When the nettle is young , the leaf makes an excellent vegetable ; when it is older , it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax . 
Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth . 
Chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; pounded , they are good for horned cattle . 
The seed of the nettle , mixed with fodder , gives gloss to the hair of animals ; the root , mixed with salt , produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter . 
Moreover , it is an excellent hay , which can be cut twice . 
And what is required for the nettle ? 
A little soil , no care , no culture . 
Only the seed falls as it is ripe , and it is difficult to collect it . 
That is all . 
With the exercise of a little care , the nettle could be made useful ; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful . 
It is exterminated . 
How many men resemble the nettle ! '' 
He added , after a pause : `` Remember this , my friends : there are no such things as bad plants or bad men . 
There are only bad cultivators . '' 
The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts . 
When he saw the door of a church hung in black , he entered : he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings . 
Widowhood and the grief of others attracted him , because of his great gentleness ; he mingled with the friends clad in mourning , with families dressed in black , with the priests groaning around a coffin . 
He seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world . 
With his eyes fixed on heaven , he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite , those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death . 
He performed a multitude of good actions , concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions . 
He penetrated houses privately , at night ; he ascended staircases furtively . 
A poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened , sometimes even forced , during his absence . 
The poor man made a clamor over it : some malefactor had been there ! 
He entered , and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture . 
The `` malefactor '' who had been there was Father Madeleine . 
He was affable and sad . 
The people said : `` There is a rich man who has not a haughty air . 
There is a happy man who has not a contented air . '' 
Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person , and that no one ever entered his chamber , which was a regular anchorite 's cell , furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men ! 
This was much talked of , so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day , and asked : `` Monsieur le Maire , pray show us your chamber . 
It is said to be a grotto . '' 
He smiled , and introduced them instantly into this `` grotto . '' 
They were well punished for their curiosity . 
The room was very simply furnished in mahogany , which was rather ugly , like all furniture of that sort , and hung with paper worth twelve sous . 
They could see nothing remarkable about it , except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver , `` for they were hall-marked , '' an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns . 
Nevertheless , people continued to say that no one ever got into the room , and that it was a hermit 's cave , a mysterious retreat , a hole , a tomb . 
It was also whispered about that he had `` immense '' sums deposited with Laffitte , with this peculiar feature , that they were always at his immediate disposal , so that , it was added , M. Madeleine could make his appearance at Laffitte 's any morning , sign a receipt , and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes . 
In reality , `` these two or three millions '' were reducible , as we have said , to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs . 
M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M. Myriel , Bishop of D -- , surnamed `` Monseigneur Bienvenu , '' who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two . 
The Bishop of D -- -- to supply here a detail which the papers omitted -- had been blind for many years before his death , and content to be blind , as his sister was beside him . 
Let us remark by the way , that to be blind and to be loved , is , in fact , one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth , where nothing is complete . 
To have continually at one 's side a woman , a daughter , a sister , a charming being , who is there because you need her and because she can not do without you ; to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us ; to be able to incessantly measure one 's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us , and to say to ourselves , `` Since she consecrates the whole of her time to me , it is because I possess the whole of her heart '' ; to behold her thought in lieu of her face ; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world ; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings ; to hear her come and go , retire , speak , return , sing , and to think that one is the centre of these steps , of this speech ; to manifest at each instant one 's personal attraction ; to feel one 's self all the more powerful because of one 's infirmity ; to become in one 's obscurity , and through one 's obscurity , the star around which this angel gravitates , -- few felicities equal this . 
The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved ; loved for one 's own sake -- let us say rather , loved in spite of one 's self ; this conviction the blind man possesses . 
To be served in distress is to be caressed . 
Does he lack anything ? 
No . 
One does not lose the sight when one has love . 
And what love ! 
A love wholly constituted of virtue ! 
There is no blindness where there is certainty . 
Soul seeks soul , gropingly , and finds it . 
And this soul , found and tested , is a woman . 
A hand sustains you ; it is hers : a mouth lightly touches your brow ; it is her mouth : you hear a breath very near you ; it is hers . 
To have everything of her , from her worship to her pity , never to be left , to have that sweet weakness aiding you , to lean upon that immovable reed , to touch Providence with one 's hands , and to be able to take it in one 's arms , -- God made tangible , -- what bliss ! 
The heart , that obscure , celestial flower , undergoes a mysterious blossoming . 
One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness ! 
The angel soul is there , uninterruptedly there ; if she departs , it is but to return again ; she vanishes like a dream , and reappears like reality . 
One feels warmth approaching , and behold ! 
she is there . 
One overflows with serenity , with gayety , with ecstasy ; one is a radiance amid the night . 
And there are a thousand little cares . 
Nothings , which are enormous in that void . 
The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you , and supplying the vanished universe to you . 
One is caressed with the soul . 
One sees nothing , but one feels that one is adored . 
It is a paradise of shadows . 
It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the other . 
The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M. sur M. On the following day , M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black , and with crape on his hat . 
This mourning was noticed in the town , and commented on . 
It seemed to throw a light on M. Madeleine 's origin . 
It was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop . 
`` He has gone into mourning for the Bishop of D -- '' said the drawing-rooms ; this raised M. Madeleine 's credit greatly , and procured for him , instantly and at one blow , a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur M . 
The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine , the probable relative of a bishop . 
M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained , by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones . 
One evening , a ruler in that petty great world , who was curious by right of seniority , ventured to ask him , `` M. le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D -- ? '' 
He said , `` No , Madame . '' 
`` But , '' resumed the dowager , `` you are wearing mourning for him . '' 
He replied , `` It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth . '' 
Another thing which was remarked , was , that every time that he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep , the mayor had him summoned , inquired his name , and gave him money . 
The little Savoyards told each other about it : a great many of them passed that way . 
VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON Little by little , and in the course of time , all this opposition subsided . 
There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine , in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to , blackening and calumnies ; then they grew to be nothing more than ill-nature , then merely malicious remarks , then even this entirely disappeared ; respect became complete , unanimous , cordial , and towards 1821 the moment arrived when the word `` Monsieur le Maire '' was pronounced at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as `` Monseigneur the Bishop '' had been pronounced in D -- in 1815 . 
People came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine . 
He put an end to differences , he prevented lawsuits , he reconciled enemies . 
Every one took him for the judge , and with good reason . 
It seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law . 
It was like an epidemic of veneration , which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district . 
One single man in the town , in the arrondissement , absolutely escaped this contagion , and , whatever Father Madeleine did , remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy . 
It seems , in fact , as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct , though pure and upright , like all instincts , which creates antipathies and sympathies , which fatally separates one nature from another nature , which does not hesitate , which feels no disquiet , which does not hold its peace , and which never belies itself , clear in its obscurity , infallible , imperious , intractable , stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents of reason , and which , in whatever manner destinies are arranged , secretly warns the man-dog of the presence of the man-cat , and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion . 
It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a street , calm , affectionate , surrounded by the blessings of all , a man of lofty stature , clad in an iron-gray frock-coat , armed with a heavy cane , and wearing a battered hat , turned round abruptly behind him , and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared , with folded arms and a slow shake of the head , and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose , a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by : `` What is that man , after all ? 
I certainly have seen him somewhere . 
In any case , I am not his dupe . '' 
This person , grave with a gravity which was almost menacing , was one of those men who , even when only seen by a rapid glimpse , arrest the spectator 's attention . 
His name was Javert , and he belonged to the police . 
At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector . 
He had not seen Madeleine 's beginnings . 
Javert owed the post which he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet , the secretary of the Minister of State , Comte Angeles , then prefect of police at Paris . 
When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made , and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine . 
Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy , which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority . 
Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness . 
It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes , we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation ; and we could easily recognize this truth , hardly perceived by the thinker , that from the oyster to the eagle , from the pig to the tiger , all animals exist in man , and that each one of them is in a man . 
Sometimes even several of them at a time . 
Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices , straying before our eyes , the visible phantoms of our souls . 
God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect . 
Only since animals are mere shadows , God has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word ; what is the use ? 
On the contrary , our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them , God has bestowed on them intelligence ; that is to say , the possibility of education . 
Social education , when well done , can always draw from a soul , of whatever sort it may be , the utility which it contains . 
This , be it said , is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent , and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man . 
The visible I in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent I. Having made this reservation , let us pass on . 
Now , if the reader will admit , for a moment , with us , that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation , it will be easy for us to say what there was in Police Officer Javert . 
The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog , which is killed by the mother because , otherwise , as he grew up , he would devour the other little ones . 
Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face , and the result will be Javert . 
Javert had been born in prison , of a fortune-teller , whose husband was in the galleys . 
As he grew up , he thought that he was outside the pale of society , and he despaired of ever re-entering it . 
He observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men , -- those who attack it and those who guard it ; he had no choice except between these two classes ; at the same time , he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity , regularity , and probity , complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung . 
He entered the police ; he succeeded there . 
At forty years of age he was an inspector . 
During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the South . 
Before proceeding further , let us come to an understanding as to the words , `` human face , '' which we have just applied to Javert . 
The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose , with two deep nostrils , towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks . 
One felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time . 
When Javert laughed , -- and his laugh was rare and terrible , -- his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth , but his gums , and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold , as on the muzzle of a wild beast . 
Javert , serious , was a watchdog ; when he laughed , he was a tiger . 
As for the rest , he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw ; his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows ; between his eyes there was a permanent , central frown , like an imprint of wrath ; his gaze was obscure ; his mouth pursed up and terrible ; his air that of ferocious command . 
This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments , comparatively ; but he rendered them almost bad , by dint of exaggerating them , -- respect for authority , hatred of rebellion ; and in his eyes , murder , robbery , all crimes , are only forms of rebellion . 
He enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state , from the prime minister to the rural policeman . 
He covered with scorn , aversion , and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil . 
He was absolute , and admitted no exceptions . 
On the one hand , he said , `` The functionary can make no mistake ; the magistrate is never the wrong . '' 
On the other hand , he said , `` These men are irremediably lost . 
Nothing good can come from them . '' 
He fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what power of making , or , if the reader will have it so , of authenticating , demons , and who place a Styx at the base of society . 
He was stoical , serious , austere ; a melancholy dreamer , humble and haughty , like fanatics . 
His glance was like a gimlet , cold and piercing . 
His whole life hung on these two words : watchfulness and supervision . 
He had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world ; he possessed the conscience of his usefulness , the religion of his functions , and he was a spy as other men are priests . 
Woe to the man who fell into his hands ! 
He would have arrested his own father , if the latter had escaped from the galleys , and would have denounced his mother , if she had broken her ban . 
And he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue . 
And , withal , a life of privation , isolation , abnegation , chastity , with never a diversion . 
It was implacable duty ; the police understood , as the Spartans understood Sparta , a pitiless lying in wait , a ferocious honesty , a marble informer , Brutus in Vidocq . 
Javert 's whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation . 
The mystical school of Joseph de Maistre , which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers , would not have failed to declare that Javert was a symbol . 
His brow was not visible ; it disappeared beneath his hat : his eyes were not visible , since they were lost under his eyebrows : his chin was not visible , for it was plunged in his cravat : his hands were not visible ; they were drawn up in his sleeves : and his cane was not visible ; he carried it under his coat . 
But when the occasion presented itself , there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow , as from an ambuscade , a narrow and angular forehead , a baleful glance , a threatening chin , enormous hands , and a monstrous cudgel . 
In his leisure moments , which were far from frequent , he read , although he hated books ; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate . 
This could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech . 
As we have said , he had no vices . 
When he was pleased with himself , he permitted himself a pinch of snuff . 
Therein lay his connection with humanity . 
The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry of Justice designates under the rubric , Vagrants . 
The name of Javert routed them by its mere utterance ; the face of Javert petrified them at sight . 
Such was this formidable man . 
Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine . 
An eye full of suspicion and conjecture . 
M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact ; but it seemed to be of no importance to him . 
He did not even put a question to Javert ; he neither sought nor avoided him ; he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it . 
He treated Javert with ease and courtesy , as he did all the rest of the world . 
It was divined , from some words which escaped Javert , that he had secretly investigated , with that curiosity which belongs to the race , and into which there enters as much instinct as will , all the anterior traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere . 
He seemed to know , and he sometimes said in covert words , that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared . 
Once he chanced to say , as he was talking to himself , `` I think I have him ! '' 
Then he remained pensive for three days , and uttered not a word . 
It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken . 
Moreover , and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present , there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature , and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused , thrown off the track , and defeated . 
Otherwise , it would be superior to intelligence , and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man . 
Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of M. Madeleine . 
One day , nevertheless , his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on M. Madeleine . 
It was on the following occasion . 
FATHER FAUCHELEVENT One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur M. ; he heard a noise , and saw a group some distance away . 
He approached . 
An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart , his horse having tumbled down . 
This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that time . 
When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood , Fauchelevent , an ex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated , had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way . 
Fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich , while he , a lawyer , was being ruined . 
This had filled him with jealousy , and he had done all he could , on every occasion , to injure Madeleine . 
Then bankruptcy had come ; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse , and neither family nor children , he had turned carter . 
The horse had two broken legs and could not rise . 
The old man was caught in the wheels . 
The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast . 
The cart was quite heavily laden . 
Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner . 
They had tried , but in vain , to drag him out . 
An unmethodical effort , aid awkwardly given , a wrong shake , might kill him . 
It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him . 
Javert , who had come up at the moment of the accident , had sent for a jack-screw . 
M. Madeleine arrived . 
People stood aside respectfully . 
`` Help ! '' 
cried old Fauchelevent . 
`` Who will be good and save the old man ? '' 
M.Madeleine turned towards those present : -- `` Is there a jack-screw to be had ? '' 
`` One has been sent for , '' answered the peasant . 
`` How long will it take to get it ? '' 
`` They have gone for the nearest , to Flachot 's place , where there is a farrier ; but it makes no difference ; it will take a good quarter of an hour . '' 
`` A quarter of an hour ! '' 
exclaimed Madeleine . 
It had rained on the preceding night ; the soil was soaked . 
The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment , and crushing the old carter 's breast more and more . 
It was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more . 
`` It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour , '' said Madeleine to the peasants , who were staring at him . 
`` We must ! '' 
`` But it will be too late then ! 
Do n't you see that the cart is sinking ? '' 
`` Well ! '' 
`` Listen , '' resumed Madeleine ; `` there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back . 
Only half a minute , and the poor man can be taken out . 
Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart ? 
There are five louis d'or to be earned ! '' 
Not a man in the group stirred . 
`` Ten louis , '' said Madeleine . 
The persons present dropped their eyes . 
One of them muttered : `` A man would need to be devilish strong . 
And then he runs the risk of getting crushed ! '' 
`` Come , '' began Madeleine again , `` twenty louis . '' 
The same silence . 
`` It is not the will which is lacking , '' said a voice . 
M. Madeleine turned round , and recognized Javert . 
He had not noticed him on his arrival . 
Javert went on : -- `` It is strength . 
One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back . '' 
Then , gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine , he went on , emphasizing every word that he uttered : -- `` Monsieur Madeleine , I have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask . '' 
Madeleine shuddered . 
Javert added , with an air of indifference , but without removing his eyes from Madeleine : -- `` He was a convict . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Madeleine . 
`` In the galleys at Toulon . '' 
Madeleine turned pale . 
Meanwhile , the cart continued to sink slowly . 
Father Fauchelevent rattled in the throat , and shrieked : -- `` I am strangling ! 
My ribs are breaking ! 
a screw ! 
something ! 
Ah ! '' 
Madeleine glanced about him . 
`` Is there , then , no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man ? '' 
No one stirred . 
Javert resumed : -- `` I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw , and he was that convict . '' 
`` Ah ! 
It is crushing me ! '' 
cried the old man . 
Madeleine raised his head , met Javert 's falcon eye still fixed upon him , looked at the motionless peasants , and smiled sadly . 
Then , without saying a word , he fell on his knees , and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry , he was underneath the vehicle . 
A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued . 
They beheld Madeleine , almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight , make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together . 
They shouted to him , `` Father Madeleine , come out ! '' 
Old Fauchelevent himself said to him , `` Monsieur Madeleine , go away ! 
You see that I am fated to die ! 
Leave me ! 
You will get yourself crushed also ! '' 
Madeleine made no reply . 
All the spectators were panting . 
The wheels had continued to sink , and it had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle . 
Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver , the cart rose slowly , the wheels half emerged from the ruts . 
They heard a stifled voice crying , `` Make haste ! 
Help ! '' 
It was Madeleine , who had just made a final effort . 
They rushed forwards . 
The devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all . 
The cart was raised by twenty arms . 
Old Fauchelevent was saved . 
Madeleine rose . 
He was pale , though dripping with perspiration . 
His clothes were torn and covered with mud . 
All wept . 
The old man kissed his knees and called him the good God . 
As for him , he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering , and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert , who was still staring at him . 
FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall . 
Father Madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself , and which was served by two sisters of charity . 
On the following morning the old man found a thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand , with these words in Father Madeleine 's writing : `` I purchase your horse and cart . '' 
The cart was broken , and the horse was dead . 
Fauchelevent recovered , but his knee remained stiff . 
M. Madeleine , on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest , got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris . 
Some time afterwards , M. Madeleine was appointed mayor . 
The first time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town , he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master 's clothes . 
From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could . 
When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it , and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor , he addressed him with profound respect . 
This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had , besides the visible signs which we have mentioned , another symptom which was none the less significant for not being visible . 
This never deceives . 
When the population suffers , when work is lacking , when there is no commerce , the tax-payer resists imposts through penury , he exhausts and oversteps his respite , and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection . 
When work is abundant , when the country is rich and happy , the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing . 
It may be said , that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches , -- the cost of collecting the taxes . 
In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M. , and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villele , then Minister of Finance . 
Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither . 
No one remembered her . 
Fortunately , the door of M. Madeleine 's factory was like the face of a friend . 
She presented herself there , and was admitted to the women 's workroom . 
The trade was entirely new to Fantine ; she could not be very skilful at it , and she therefore earned but little by her day 's work ; but it was sufficient ; the problem was solved ; she was earning her living . 
MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY When Fantine saw that she was making her living , she felt joyful for a moment . 
To live honestly by her own labor , what mercy from heaven ! 
The taste for work had really returned to her . 
She bought a looking-glass , took pleasure in surveying in it her youth , her beautiful hair , her fine teeth ; she forgot many things ; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future , and was almost happy . 
She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work -- a lingering trace of her improvident ways . 
As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care , as we have seen , not to mention her little girl . 
At first , as the reader has seen , she paid the Thenardiers promptly . 
As she only knew how to sign her name , she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer . 
She wrote often , and this was noticed . 
It began to be said in an undertone , in the women 's workroom , that Fantine `` wrote letters '' and that `` she had ways about her . '' 
There is no one for spying on people 's actions like those who are not concerned in them . 
Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall ? 
Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday ? 
Why does he always take the narrow streets ? 
Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house ? 
Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper , when she has a `` whole stationer 's shop full of it ? '' 
etc. . 
There exist beings who , for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas , which are , moreover , of no consequence whatever to them , spend more money , waste more time , take more trouble , than would be required for ten good actions , and that gratuitously , for their own pleasure , without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity . 
They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days ; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets , under alley-way doors at night , in cold and rain ; they will bribe errand-porters , they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy , buy a waiting-maid , suborn a porter . 
Why ? 
For no reason . 
A pure passion for seeing , knowing , and penetrating into things . 
A pure itch for talking . 
And often these secrets once known , these mysteries made public , these enigmas illuminated by the light of day , bring on catastrophies , duels , failures , the ruin of families , and broken lives , to the great joy of those who have `` found out everything , '' without any interest in the matter , and by pure instinct . 
A sad thing . 
Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking . 
Their conversation , the chat of the drawing-room , gossip of the anteroom , is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly ; they need a great amount of combustibles ; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors . 
So Fantine was watched . 
In addition , many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth . 
It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside , in the midst of the rest , to wipe away a tear . 
These were the moments when she was thinking of her child ; perhaps , also , of the man whom she had loved . 
Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task . 
It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least , and that she paid the carriage on the letter . 
They managed to obtain the address : Monsieur , Monsieur Thenardier , inn-keeper at Montfermeil . 
The public writer , a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets , was made to talk in the wine-shop . 
In short , it was discovered that Fantine had a child . 
`` She must be a pretty sort of a woman . '' 
An old gossip was found , who made the trip to Montfermeil , talked to the Thenardiers , and said on her return : `` For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind . 
I have seen the child . '' 
The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien , the guardian and door-keeper of every one 's virtue . 
Madame Victurnien was fifty-six , and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age . 
A quavering voice , a whimsical mind . 
This old dame had once been young -- astonishing fact ! 
In her youth , in ' 93 , she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap , and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins . 
She was dry , rough , peevish , sharp , captious , almost venomous ; all this in memory of her monk , whose widow she was , and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will . 
She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible . 
At the Restoration she had turned bigot , and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk . 
She had a small property , which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community . 
She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras . 
So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil , and returned with the remark , `` I have seen the child . '' 
All this took time . 
Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year , when , one morning , the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor , told her that she was no longer employed in the shop , and requested her , in the mayor 's name , to leave the neighborhood . 
This was the very month when the Thenardiers , after having demanded twelve francs instead of six , had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve . 
Fantine was overwhelmed . 
She could not leave the neighborhood ; she was in debt for her rent and furniture . 
Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt . 
She stammered a few supplicating words . 
The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant . 
Besides , Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman . 
Overcome with shame , even more than with despair , she quitted the shop , and returned to her room . 
So her fault was now known to every one . 
She no longer felt strong enough to say a word . 
She was advised to see the mayor ; she did not dare . 
The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good , and had dismissed her because he was just . 
She bowed before the decision . 
MADAME VICTURNIEN 'S SUCCESS So the monk 's widow was good for something . 
But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this . 
Life is full of just such combinations of events . 
M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women 's workroom . 
At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster , whom the priest had provided for him , and he had full confidence in this superintendent , -- a truly respectable person , firm , equitable , upright , full of the charity which consists in giving , but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving . 
M. Madeleine relied wholly on her . 
The best men are often obliged to delegate their authority . 
It was with this full power , and the conviction that she was doing right , that the superintendent had instituted the suit , judged , condemned , and executed Fantine . 
As regards the fifty francs , she had given them from a fund which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes , and for giving assistance to the workwomen , and of which she rendered no account . 
Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood ; she went from house to house . 
No one would have her . 
She could not leave town . 
The second-hand dealer , to whom she was in debt for her furniture -- and what furniture ! 
-- said to her , `` If you leave , I will have you arrested as a thief . '' 
The householder , whom she owed for her rent , said to her , `` You are young and pretty ; you can pay . '' 
She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer , returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods , kept only necessaries , and found herself without work , without a trade , with nothing but her bed , and still about fifty francs in debt . 
She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison , and earned twelve sous a day . 
Her daughter cost her ten . 
It was at this point that she began to pay the Thenardiers irregularly . 
However , the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night , taught her the art of living in misery . 
Back of living on little , there is the living on nothing . 
These are the two chambers ; the first is dark , the second is black . 
Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter ; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing 's worth of millet every two days ; how to make a coverlet of one 's petticoat , and a petticoat of one 's coverlet ; how to save one 's candle , by taking one 's meals by the light of the opposite window . 
No one knows all that certain feeble creatures , who have grown old in privation and honesty , can get out of a sou . 
It ends by being a talent . 
Fantine acquired this sublime talent , and regained a little courage . 
At this epoch she said to a neighbor , `` Bah ! 
I say to myself , by only sleeping five hours , and working all the rest of the time at my sewing , I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread . 
And , then , when one is sad , one eats less . 
Well , sufferings , uneasiness , a little bread on one hand , trouble on the other , -- all this will support me . '' 
It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress . 
She thought of having her come . 
But what then ! 
Make her share her own destitution ! 
And then , she was in debt to the Thenardiers ! 
How could she pay them ? 
And the journey ! 
How pay for that ? 
The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence , was a sainted spinster named Marguerite , who was pious with a true piety , poor and charitable towards the poor , and even towards the rich , knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself Marguerite , and believing in God , which is science . 
There are many such virtuous people in this lower world ; some day they will be in the world above . 
This life has a morrow . 
At first , Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out . 
When she was in the street , she divined that people turned round behind her , and pointed at her ; every one stared at her and no one greeted her ; the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind . 
It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns . 
In Paris , at least , no one knows you , and this obscurity is a garment . 
Oh ! 
how she would have liked to betake herself to Paris ! 
Impossible ! 
She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute , as she had accustomed herself to indigence . 
Gradually she decided on her course . 
At the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame , and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter . 
`` It is all the same to me , '' she said . 
She went and came , bearing her head well up , with a bitter smile , and was conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced . 
Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing , from her window , noticed the distress of `` that creature '' who , `` thanks to her , '' had been `` put back in her proper place , '' and congratulated herself . 
The happiness of the evil-minded is black . 
Excess of toil wore out Fantine , and the little dry cough which troubled her increased . 
She sometimes said to her neighbor , Marguerite , `` Just feel how hot my hands are ! '' 
Nevertheless , when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb , and it flowed about her like floss silk , she experienced a moment of happy coquetry . 
RESULT OF THE SUCCESS She had been dismissed towards the end of the winter ; the summer passed , but winter came again . 
Short days , less work . 
Winter : no warmth , no light , no noonday , the evening joining on to the morning , fogs , twilight ; the window is gray ; it is impossible to see clearly at it . 
The sky is but a vent-hole . 
The whole day is a cavern . 
The sun has the air of a beggar . 
A frightful season ! 
Winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone . 
Her creditors harrassed her . 
Fantine earned too little . 
Her debts had increased . 
The Thenardiers , who were not promptly paid , wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair , and whose carriage ruined her . 
One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather , that she needed a woollen skirt , and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this . 
She received the letter , and crushed it in her hands all day long . 
That evening she went into a barber 's shop at the corner of the street , and pulled out her comb . 
Her admirable golden hair fell to her knees . 
`` What splendid hair ! '' 
exclaimed the barber . 
`` How much will you give me for it ? '' 
said she . 
`` Ten francs . '' 
`` Cut it off . '' 
She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thenardiers . 
This petticoat made the Thenardiers furious . 
It was the money that they wanted . 
They gave the petticoat to Eponine . 
The poor Lark continued to shiver . 
Fantine thought : `` My child is no longer cold . 
I have clothed her with my hair . '' 
She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head , and in which she was still pretty . 
Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine 's heart . 
When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair , she began to hate every one about her . 
She had long shared the universal veneration for Father Madeleine ; yet , by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her , that he was the cause of her unhappiness , she came to hate him also , and most of all . 
When she passed the factory in working hours , when the workpeople were at the door , she affected to laugh and sing . 
An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said , `` There 's a girl who will come to a bad end . 
She took a lover , the first who offered , a man whom she did not love , out of bravado and with rage in her heart . 
He was a miserable scamp , a sort of mendicant musician , a lazy beggar , who beat her , and who abandoned her as she had taken him , in disgust . 
She adored her child . 
The lower she descended , the darker everything grew about her , the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart . 
She said , `` When I get rich , I will have my Cosette with me ; '' and she laughed . 
Her cough did not leave her , and she had sweats on her back . 
One day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms : `` Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood . 
A miliary fever , they call it . 
Expensive drugs are required . 
This is ruining us , and we can no longer pay for them . 
If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out , the little one will be dead . '' 
She burst out laughing , and said to her old neighbor : `` Ah ! 
they are good ! 
Forty francs ! 
the idea ! 
That makes two napoleons ! 
Where do they think I am to get them ? 
These peasants are stupid , truly . '' 
Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more . 
Then she descended the stairs and emerged , running and leaping and still laughing . 
Some one met her and said to her , `` What makes you so gay ? '' 
She replied : `` A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me . 
They demand forty francs of me . 
So much for you , you peasants ! '' 
As she crossed the square , she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape , upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red , who was holding forth . 
He was a quack dentist on his rounds , who was offering to the public full sets of teeth , opiates , powders and elixirs . 
Fantine mingled in the group , and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue , which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people . 
The tooth-puller espied the lovely , laughing girl , and suddenly exclaimed : `` You have beautiful teeth , you girl there , who are laughing ; if you want to sell me your palettes , I will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them . '' 
`` What are my palettes ? '' 
asked Fantine . 
`` The palettes , '' replied the dental professor , `` are the front teeth , the two upper ones . '' 
`` How horrible ! '' 
exclaimed Fantine . 
`` Two napoleons ! '' 
grumbled a toothless old woman who was present . 
`` Here 's a lucky girl ! '' 
Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her : `` Reflect , my beauty ! 
two napoleons ; they may prove of service . 
If your heart bids you , come this evening to the inn of the Tillac d'Argent ; you will find me there . '' 
Fantine returned home . 
She was furious , and related the occurrence to her good neighbor Marguerite : `` Can you understand such a thing ? 
Is he not an abominable man ? 
How can they allow such people to go about the country ! 
Pull out my two front teeth ! 
Why , I should be horrible ! 
My hair will grow again , but my teeth ! 
Ah ! 
what a monster of a man ! 
I should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story ! 
He told me that he should be at the Tillac d'Argent this evening . '' 
`` And what did he offer ? '' 
asked Marguerite . 
`` Two napoleons . '' 
`` That makes forty francs . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Fantine ; `` that makes forty francs . '' 
She remained thoughtful , and began her work . 
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thenardiers ' letter once more on the staircase . 
On her return , she said to Marguerite , who was at work beside her : -- `` What is a miliary fever ? 
Do you know ? '' 
`` Yes , '' answered the old spinster ; `` it is a disease . '' 
`` Does it require many drugs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
terrible drugs . '' 
`` How does one get it ? '' 
`` It is a malady that one gets without knowing how . '' 
`` Then it attacks children ? '' 
`` Children in particular . '' 
`` Do people die of it ? '' 
`` They may , '' said Marguerite . 
Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase . 
That evening she went out , and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the Rue de Paris , where the inns are situated . 
The next morning , when Marguerite entered Fantine 's room before daylight , -- for they always worked together , and in this manner used only one candle for the two , -- she found Fantine seated on her bed , pale and frozen . 
She had not lain down . 
Her cap had fallen on her knees . 
Her candle had burned all night , and was almost entirely consumed . 
Marguerite halted on the threshold , petrified at this tremendous wastefulness , and exclaimed : -- `` Lord ! 
the candle is all burned out ! 
Something has happened . '' 
Then she looked at Fantine , who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair . 
Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night . 
`` Jesus ! '' 
said Marguerite , `` what is the matter with you , Fantine ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Fantine . 
`` Quite the contrary . 
My child will not die of that frightful malady , for lack of succor . 
I am content . '' 
So saying , she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table . 
`` Ah ! 
Jesus God ! '' 
cried Marguerite . 
`` Why , it is a fortune ! 
Where did you get those louis d'or ? '' 
`` I got them , '' replied Fantine . 
At the same time she smiled . 
The candle illuminated her countenance . 
It was a bloody smile . 
A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips , and she had a black hole in her mouth . 
The two teeth had been extracted . 
She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil . 
After all it was a ruse of the Thenardiers to obtain money . 
Cosette was not ill . 
Fantine threw her mirror out of the window . 
She had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it , next the roof ; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor , and knocks you on the head every instant . 
The poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny , only by bending over more and more . 
She had no longer a bed ; a rag which she called her coverlet , a mattress on the floor , and a seatless chair still remained . 
A little rosebush which she had , had dried up , forgotten , in one corner . 
In the other corner was a butter-pot to hold water , which froze in winter , and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice . 
She had lost her shame ; she lost her coquetry . 
A final sign . 
She went out , with dirty caps . 
Whether from lack of time or from indifference , she no longer mended her linen . 
As the heels wore out , she dragged her stockings down into her shoes . 
This was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles . 
She patched her bodice , which was old and worn out , with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement . 
The people to whom she was indebted made `` scenes '' and gave her no peace . 
She found them in the street , she found them again on her staircase . 
She passed many a night weeping and thinking . 
Her eyes were very bright , and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder-blade . 
She coughed a great deal . 
She deeply hated Father Madeleine , but made no complaint . 
She sewed seventeen hours a day ; but a contractor for the work of prisons , who made the prisoners work at a discount , suddenly made prices fall , which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous . 
Seventeen hours of toil , and nine sous a day ! 
Her creditors were more pitiless than ever . 
The second-hand dealer , who had taken back nearly all his furniture , said to her incessantly , `` When will you pay me , you hussy ? '' 
What did they want of her , good God ! 
She felt that she was being hunted , and something of the wild beast developed in her . 
About the same time , Thenardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once ; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of doors , convalescent as she was from her heavy illness , into the cold and the streets , and that she might do what she liked with herself , and die if she chose . 
`` A hundred francs , '' thought Fantine . 
`` But in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day ? '' 
`` Come ! '' 
said she , `` let us sell what is left . '' 
The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town . 
CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT What is this history of Fantine ? 
It is society purchasing a slave . 
From whom ? 
From misery . 
From hunger , cold , isolation , destitution . 
A dolorous bargain . 
A soul for a morsel of bread . 
Misery offers ; society accepts . 
The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization , but it does not , as yet , permeate it ; it is said that slavery has disappeared from European civilization . 
This is a mistake . 
It still exists ; but it weighs only upon the woman , and it is called prostitution . 
It weighs upon the woman , that is to say , upon grace , weakness , beauty , maternity . 
This is not one of the least of man 's disgraces . 
At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached , nothing is left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been . 
She has become marble in becoming mire . 
Whoever touches her feels cold . 
She passes ; she endures you ; she ignores you ; she is the severe and dishonored figure . 
Life and the social order have said their last word for her . 
All has happened to her that will happen to her . 
She has felt everything , borne everything , experienced everything , suffered everything , lost everything , mourned everything . 
She is resigned , with that resignation which resembles indifference , as death resembles sleep . 
She no longer avoids anything . 
Let all the clouds fall upon her , and all the ocean sweep over her ! 
What matters it to her ? 
She is a sponge that is soaked . 
At least , she believes it to be so ; but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted , and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever . 
Alas ! 
What are all these fates , driven on pell-mell ? 
Whither are they going ? 
Why are they thus ? 
He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow . 
He is alone . 
His name is God . 
M. BAMATABOIS 'S INACTIVITY There is in all small towns , and there was at M. sur M. in particular , a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year in Paris . 
These are beings of the great neuter species : impotent men , parasites , cyphers , who have a little land , a little folly , a little wit ; who would be rustics in a drawing-room , and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop ; who say , `` My fields , my peasants , my woods '' ; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste ; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war ; hunt , smoke , yawn , drink , smell of tobacco , play billiards , stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence , live at the cafe , dine at the inn , have a dog which eats the bones under the table , and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table ; who stick at a sou , exaggerate the fashions , admire tragedy , despise women , wear out their old boots , copy London through Paris , and Paris through the medium of Pont-A-Mousson , grow old as dullards , never work , serve no use , and do no great harm . 
M. Felix Tholomyes , had he remained in his own province and never beheld Paris , would have been one of these men . 
If they were richer , one would say , `` They are dandies ; '' if they were poorer , one would say , `` They are idlers . '' 
They are simply men without employment . 
Among these unemployed there are bores , the bored , dreamers , and some knaves . 
At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar , a big cravat , a watch with trinkets , three vests of different colors , worn one on top of the other -- the red and blue inside ; of a short-waisted olive coat , with a codfish tail , a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder ; and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive , ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite , but always uneven , number of lines , varying from one to eleven -- a limit which was never exceeded . 
Add to this , high shoes with little irons on the heels , a tall hat with a narrow brim , hair worn in a tuft , an enormous cane , and conversation set off by puns of Potier . 
Over all , spurs and a mustache . 
At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois , and spurs the pedestrian . 
The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches . 
It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with the King of Spain , of Bolivar against Morillo . 
Narrow-brimmed hats were royalist , and were called morillos ; liberals wore hats with wide brims , which were called bolivars . 
Eight or ten months , then , after that which is related in the preceding pages , towards the first of January , 1823 , on a snowy evening , one of these dandies , one of these unemployed , a `` right thinker , '' for he wore a morillo , and was , moreover , warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather , was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress , with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair , in front of the officers ' cafe . 
This dandy was smoking , for he was decidedly fashionable . 
Each time that the woman passed in front of him , he bestowed on her , together with a puff from his cigar , some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful , such as , `` How ugly you are ! 
-- Will you get out of my sight ? 
-- You have no teeth ! '' 
etc. , etc. . 
This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois . 
The woman , a melancholy , decorated spectre which went and came through the snow , made him no reply , did not even glance at him , and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence , and with a sombre regularity , which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm , like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods . 
The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger ; and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned , he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf , and stifling his laugh , bent down , picked up a handful of snow from the pavement , and thrust it abruptly into her back , between her bare shoulders . 
The woman uttered a roar , whirled round , gave a leap like a panther , and hurled herself upon the man , burying her nails in his face , with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter . 
These insults , poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy , did , indeed , proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth . 
It was Fantine . 
At the noise thus produced , the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe , passers-by collected , and a large and merry circle , hooting and applauding , was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings , whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman : the man struggling , his hat on the ground ; the woman striking out with feet and fists , bareheaded , howling , minus hair and teeth , livid with wrath , horrible . 
Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd , seized the woman by her satin bodice , which was covered with mud , and said to her , `` Follow me ! '' 
The woman raised her head ; her furious voice suddenly died away . 
Her eyes were glassy ; she turned pale instead of livid , and she trembled with a quiver of terror . 
She had recognized Javert . 
The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape . 
THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE MUNICIPAL POLICE Javert thrust aside the spectators , broke the circle , and set out with long strides towards the police station , which is situated at the extremity of the square , dragging the wretched woman after him . 
She yielded mechanically . 
Neither he nor she uttered a word . 
The cloud of spectators followed , jesting , in a paroxysm of delight . 
Supreme misery an occasion for obscenity . 
On arriving at the police station , which was a low room , warmed by a stove , with a glazed and grated door opening on the street , and guarded by a detachment , Javert opened the door , entered with Fantine , and shut the door behind him , to the great disappointment of the curious , who raised themselves on tiptoe , and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house , in their effort to see . 
Curiosity is a sort of gluttony . 
To see is to devour . 
On entering , Fantine fell down in a corner , motionless and mute , crouching down like a terrified dog . 
The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table . 
Javert seated himself , drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket , and began to write . 
This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police . 
The latter do what they please , punish them , as seems good to them , and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty . 
Javert was impassive ; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever . 
Nevertheless , he was seriously and deeply preoccupied . 
It was one of those moments when he was exercising without control , but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience , his redoubtable discretionary power . 
At that moment he was conscious that his police agent 's stool was a tribunal . 
He was entering judgment . 
He judged and condemned . 
He summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind , around the great thing which he was doing . 
The more he examined the deed of this woman , the more shocked he felt . 
It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime . 
He had just beheld , yonder , in the street , society , in the person of a freeholder and an elector , insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales . 
A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen . 
He had seen that , he , Javert . 
He wrote in silence . 
When he had finished he signed the paper , folded it , and said to the sergeant of the guard , as he handed it to him , `` Take three men and conduct this creature to jail . '' 
Then , turning to Fantine , `` You are to have six months of it . '' 
The unhappy woman shuddered . 
`` Six months ! 
six months of prison ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
`` Six months in which to earn seven sous a day ! 
But what will become of Cosette ? 
My daughter ! 
my daughter ! 
But I still owe the Thenardiers over a hundred francs ; do you know that , Monsieur Inspector ? '' 
She dragged herself across the damp floor , among the muddy boots of all those men , without rising , with clasped hands , and taking great strides on her knees . 
`` Monsieur Javert , '' said she , `` I beseech your mercy . 
I assure you that I was not in the wrong . 
If you had seen the beginning , you would have seen . 
I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame ! 
That gentleman , the bourgeois , whom I do not know , put snow in my back . 
Has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably , and doing no harm to any one ? 
I am rather ill , as you see . 
And then , he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time : ` You are ugly ! 
you have no teeth ! ' 
I know well that I have no longer those teeth . 
I did nothing ; I said to myself , ` The gentleman is amusing himself . ' 
I was honest with him ; I did not speak to him . 
It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back . 
Monsieur Javert , good Monsieur Inspector ! 
is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true ? 
Perhaps I did wrong to get angry . 
You know that one is not master of one 's self at the first moment . 
One gives way to vivacity ; and then , when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it ! 
I did wrong to spoil that gentleman 's hat . 
Why did he go away ? 
I would ask his pardon . 
Oh , my God ! 
It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon . 
Do me the favor to-day , for this once , Monsieur Javert . 
Hold ! 
you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day ; it is not the government 's fault , but seven sous is one 's earnings ; and just fancy , I must pay one hundred francs , or my little girl will be sent to me . 
Oh , my God ! 
I can not have her with me . 
What I do is so vile ! 
Oh , my Cosette ! 
Oh , my little angel of the Holy Virgin ! 
what will become of her , poor creature ? 
I will tell you : it is the Thenardiers , inn-keepers , peasants ; and such people are unreasonable . 
They want money . 
Do n't put me in prison ! 
You see , there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may , in the very heart of the winter ; and you must have pity on such a being , my good Monsieur Javert . 
If she were older , she might earn her living ; but it can not be done at that age . 
I am not a bad woman at bottom . 
It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what I am . 
If I have drunk brandy , it was out of misery . 
I do not love it ; but it benumbs the senses . 
When I was happy , it was only necessary to glance into my closets , and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and untidy woman . 
I had linen , a great deal of linen . 
Have pity on me , Monsieur Javert ! '' 
She spoke thus , rent in twain , shaken with sobs , blinded with tears , her neck bare , wringing her hands , and coughing with a dry , short cough , stammering softly with a voice of agony . 
Great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray , which transfigures the unhappy . 
At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once more . 
From time to time she paused , and tenderly kissed the police agent 's coat . 
She would have softened a heart of granite ; but a heart of wood can not be softened . 
`` Come ! '' 
said Javert , `` I have heard you out . 
Have you entirely finished ? 
You will get six months . 
Now march ! 
The Eternal Father in person could do nothing more . '' 
At these solemn words , `` the Eternal Father in person could do nothing more , '' she understood that her fate was sealed . 
She sank down , murmuring , `` Mercy ! '' 
Javert turned his back . 
The soldiers seized her by the arms . 
A few moments earlier a man had entered , but no one had paid any heed to him . 
He shut the door , leaned his back against it , and listened to Fantine 's despairing supplications . 
At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman , who would not rise , he emerged from the shadow , and said : -- `` One moment , if you please . '' 
Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine . 
He removed his hat , and , saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness : -- `` Excuse me , Mr. Mayor -- '' The words `` Mr. Mayor '' produced a curious effect upon Fantine . 
She rose to her feet with one bound , like a spectre springing from the earth , thrust aside the soldiers with both arms , walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one could prevent her , and gazing intently at him , with a bewildered air , she cried : -- `` Ah ! 
so it is you who are M. le Maire ! '' 
Then she burst into a laugh , and spit in his face . 
M. Madeleine wiped his face , and said : -- `` Inspector Javert , set this woman at liberty . '' 
Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad . 
He experienced at that moment , blow upon blow and almost simultaneously , the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life . 
To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor 's face was a thing so monstrous that , in his most daring flights of fancy , he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible . 
On the other hand , at the very bottom of his thought , he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was , and as to what this mayor might be ; and then he , with horror , caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack . 
But when he beheld that mayor , that magistrate , calmly wipe his face and say , `` Set this woman at liberty , '' he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement ; thought and word failed him equally ; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case . 
He remained mute . 
The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine . 
She raised her bare arm , and clung to the damper of the stove , like a person who is reeling . 
Nevertheless , she glanced about her , and began to speak in a low voice , as though talking to herself : -- `` At liberty ! 
I am to be allowed to go ! 
I am not to go to prison for six months ! 
Who said that ? 
It is not possible that any one could have said that . 
I did not hear aright . 
It can not have been that monster of a mayor ! 
Was it you , my good Monsieur Javert , who said that I was to be set free ? 
Oh , see here ! 
I will tell you about it , and you will let me go . 
That monster of a mayor , that old blackguard of a mayor , is the cause of all . 
Just imagine , Monsieur Javert , he turned me out ! 
all because of a pack of rascally women , who gossip in the workroom . 
If that is not a horror , what is ? 
To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly ! 
Then I could no longer earn enough , and all this misery followed . 
In the first place , there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make , and that is , to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people . 
I will explain it to you , you see : you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making , the price falls to nine sous ; and it is not enough to live on . 
Then one has to become whatever one can . 
As for me , I had my little Cosette , and I was actually forced to become a bad woman . 
Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief . 
After that I stamped on that gentleman 's hat in front of the officers ' cafe ; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow . 
We women have but one silk dress for evening wear . 
You see that I did not do wrong deliberately -- truly , Monsieur Javert ; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I , and who are much happier . 
O Monsieur Javert ! 
it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free , was it not ? 
Make inquiries , speak to my landlord ; I am paying my rent now ; they will tell you that I am perfectly honest . 
Ah ! 
my God ! 
I beg your pardon ; I have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove , and it has made it smoke . '' 
M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention . 
While she was speaking , he fumbled in his waistcoat , drew out his purse and opened it . 
It was empty . 
He put it back in his pocket . 
He said to Fantine , `` How much did you say that you owed ? '' 
Fantine , who was looking at Javert only , turned towards him : -- `` Was I speaking to you ? '' 
Then , addressing the soldiers : -- `` Say , you fellows , did you see how I spit in his face ? 
Ah ! 
you old wretch of a mayor , you came here to frighten me , but I 'm not afraid of you . 
I am afraid of Monsieur Javert . 
I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert ! '' 
So saying , she turned to the inspector again : -- `` And yet , you see , Mr. Inspector , it is necessary to be just . 
I understand that you are just , Mr. Inspector ; in fact , it is perfectly simple : a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman 's back , and that makes the officers laugh ; one must divert themselves in some way ; and we -- well , we are here for them to amuse themselves with , of course ! 
And then , you , you come ; you are certainly obliged to preserve order , you lead off the woman who is in the wrong ; but on reflection , since you are a good man , you say that I am to be set at liberty ; it is for the sake of the little one , for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child . 
` Only , do n't do it again , you hussy ! ' 
Oh ! 
I wo n't do it again , Monsieur Javert ! 
They may do whatever they please to me now ; I will not stir . 
But to-day , you see , I cried because it hurt me . 
I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all ; and then as I told you , I am not well ; I have a cough ; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach , and the doctor tells me , ` Take care of yourself . ' 
Here , feel , give me your hand ; do n't be afraid -- it is here . '' 
She no longer wept , her voice was caressing ; she placed Javert 's coarse hand on her delicate , white throat and looked smilingly at him . 
All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments , dropped the folds of her skirt , which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along , almost to the height of her knee , and stepped towards the door , saying to the soldiers in a low voice , and with a friendly nod : -- `` Children , Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released , and I am going . '' 
She laid her hand on the latch of the door . 
One step more and she would be in the street . 
Javert up to that moment had remained erect , motionless , with his eyes fixed on the ground , cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue , which is waiting to be put away somewhere . 
The sound of the latch roused him . 
He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority , an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level , ferocious in the wild beast , atrocious in the man of no estate . 
`` Sergeant ! '' 
he cried , `` do n't you see that that jade is walking off ! 
Who bade you let her go ? '' 
`` I , '' said Madeleine . 
Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert 's voice , and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen . 
At the sound of Madeleine 's voice she turned around , and from that moment forth she uttered no word , nor dared so much as to breathe freely , but her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert , and from Javert to Madeleine in turn , according to which was speaking . 
It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done , after the mayor 's suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty . 
Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor 's presence ? 
Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any `` authority '' should have given such an order , and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another , without intending it ? 
Or , in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours , did he say to himself , that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions , that it was indispensable that the small should be made great , that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate , that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice , and that , in this prodigious extremity , order , law , morality , government , society in its entirety , was personified in him , Javert ? 
However that may be , when M. Madeleine uttered that word , I , as we have just heard , Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor , pale , cold , with blue lips , and a look of despair , his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence , and say to him , with downcast eyes but a firm voice : -- `` Mr. Mayor , that can not be . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
said M. Madeleine . 
`` This miserable woman has insulted a citizen . '' 
`` Inspector Javert , '' replied the mayor , in a calm and conciliating tone , `` listen . 
You are an honest man , and I feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you . 
Here is the true state of the case : I was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away ; there were still groups of people standing about , and I made inquiries and learned everything ; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police . '' 
Javert retorted : -- `` This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire . '' 
`` That concerns me , '' said M. Madeleine . 
`` My own insult belongs to me , I think . 
I can do what I please about it . '' 
`` I beg Monsieur le Maire 's pardon . 
The insult is not to him but to the law . '' 
`` Inspector Javert , '' replied M. Madeleine , `` the highest law is conscience . 
I have heard this woman ; I know what I am doing . '' 
`` And I , Mr. Mayor , do not know what I see . '' 
`` Then content yourself with obeying . '' 
`` I am obeying my duty . 
My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison . '' 
M. Madeleine replied gently : -- `` Heed this well ; she will not serve a single day . '' 
At this decisive word , Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say , but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful : -- `` I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire ; it is for the first time in my life , but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my authority . 
I confine myself , since Monsieur le Maire desires it , to the question of the gentleman . 
I was present . 
This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabnois , who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony , which forms the corner of the esplanade , three stories high and entirely of cut stone . 
Such things as there are in the world ! 
In any case , Monsieur le Maire , this is a question of police regulations in the streets , and concerns me , and I shall detain this woman Fantine . '' 
Then M. Madeleine folded his arms , and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto : -- `` The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police . 
According to the terms of articles nine , eleven , fifteen , and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination , I am the judge . 
I order that this woman shall be set at liberty . '' 
Javert ventured to make a final effort . 
`` But , Mr. Mayor -- '' `` I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December , 1799 , in regard to arbitrary detention . '' 
`` Monsieur le Maire , permit me -- '' `` Not another word . '' 
`` But -- '' `` Leave the room , '' said M. Madeleine . 
Javert received the blow erect , full in the face , in his breast , like a Russian soldier . 
He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room . 
Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed . 
Nevertheless , she also was the prey to a strange confusion . 
She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers . 
She had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty , her life , her soul , her child , in combat before her very eyes ; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness , the other was leading her back towards the light . 
In this conflict , viewed through the exaggerations of terror , these two men had appeared to her like two giants ; the one spoke like her demon , the other like her good angel . 
The angel had conquered the demon , and , strange to say , that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel , this liberator , was the very man whom she abhorred , that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes , that Madeleine ! 
And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion , he had saved her ! 
Had she , then , been mistaken ? 
Must she change her whole soul ? 
She did not know ; she trembled . 
She listened in bewilderment , she looked on in affright , and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her , and something warm and ineffable , indescribable , which was both joy , confidence and love , dawn in her heart . 
When Javert had taken his departure , M. Madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice , like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking : -- `` I have heard you . 
I knew nothing about what you have mentioned . 
I believe that it is true , and I feel that it is true . 
I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop . 
Why did you not apply to me ? 
But here ; I will pay your debts , I will send for your child , or you shall go to her . 
You shall live here , in Paris , or where you please . 
I undertake the care of your child and yourself . 
You shall not work any longer if you do not like . 
I will give all the money you require . 
You shall be honest and happy once more . 
And listen ! 
I declare to you that if all is as you say , -- and I do not doubt it , -- you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God . 
Oh ! 
poor woman . '' 
This was more than Fantine could bear . 
To have Cosette ! 
To leave this life of infamy . 
To live free , rich , happy , respectable with Cosette ; to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery . 
She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her , and could only give vent to two or three sobs , `` Oh ! 
Oh ! 
Oh ! '' 
Her limbs gave way beneath her , she knelt in front of M. Madeleine , and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it . 
Then she fainted . 
THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house . 
He confided her to the sisters , who put her to bed . 
A burning fever had come on . 
She passed a part of the night in delirium and raving . 
At length , however , she fell asleep . 
On the morrow , towards midday , Fantine awoke . 
She heard some one breathing close to her bed ; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head . 
His gaze was full of pity , anguish , and supplication . 
She followed its direction , and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall . 
Thenceforth , M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine 's eyes . 
He seemed to her to be clothed in light . 
He was absorbed in a sort of prayer . 
She gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him . 
At last she said timidly : -- `` What are you doing ? '' 
M. Madeleine had been there for an hour . 
He had been waiting for Fantine to awake . 
He took her hand , felt of her pulse , and replied : -- `` How do you feel ? '' 
`` Well , I have slept , '' she replied ; `` I think that I am better , It is nothing . '' 
He answered , responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it : -- `` I was praying to the martyr there on high . '' 
And he added in his own mind , `` For the martyr here below . '' 
M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries . 
He knew all now . 
He knew Fantine 's history in all its heart-rending details . 
He went on : -- `` You have suffered much , poor mother . 
Oh ! 
do not complain ; you now have the dowry of the elect . 
It is thus that men are transformed into angels . 
It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise . 
You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven . 
It was necessary to begin there . '' 
He sighed deeply . 
But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking . 
That same night , Javert wrote a letter . 
The next morning be posted it himself at the office of M. sur M . 
It was addressed to Paris , and the superscription ran : To Monsieur Chabouillet , Secretary of Monsieur le Prefet of Police . 
As the affair in the station-house had been bruited about , the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off , and who recognized Javert 's handwriting on the cover , thought that he was sending in his resignation . 
M.Madeleine made haste to write to the Thenardiers . 
Fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs . 
He sent them three hundred francs , telling them to pay themselves from that sum , and to fetch the child instantly to M. sur M. , where her sick mother required her presence . 
This dazzled Thenardier . 
`` The devil ! '' 
said the man to his wife ; `` do n't let 's allow the child to go . 
This lark is going to turn into a milch cow . 
I see through it . 
Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother . '' 
He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd francs . 
In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs , -- one for the doctor , the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two long illnesses . 
Cosette , as we have already said , had not been ill . 
It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names . 
At the foot of the memorandum Thenardier wrote , Received on account , three hundred francs . 
M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more , and wrote , `` Make haste to bring Cosette . '' 
`` Christi ! '' 
said Thenardier , `` let 's not give up the child . '' 
In the meantime , Fantine did not recover . 
She still remained in the infirmary . 
The sisters had at first only received and nursed `` that woman '' with repugnance . 
Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins . 
The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity ; the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion . 
But in a few days Fantine disarmed them . 
She said all kinds of humble and gentle things , and the mother in her provoked tenderness . 
One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever : `` I have been a sinner ; but when I have my child beside me , it will be a sign that God has pardoned me . 
While I was leading a bad life , I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me ; I could not have borne her sad , astonished eyes . 
It was for her sake that I did evil , and that is why God pardons me . 
I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here . 
I shall gaze at her ; it will do me good to see that innocent creature . 
She knows nothing at all . 
She is an angel , you see , my sisters . 
At that age the wings have not fallen off . '' 
M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day , and each time she asked him : -- `` Shall I see my Cosette soon ? '' 
He answered : -- `` To-morrow , perhaps . 
She may arrive at any moment . 
I am expecting her . '' 
And the mother 's pale face grew radiant . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she said , `` how happy I am going to be ! '' 
We have just said that she did not recover her health . 
On the contrary , her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week . 
That handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration , as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last . 
At that time people were beginning to follow the fine Laennec 's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies . 
The doctor sounded Fantine 's chest and shook his head . 
M. Madeleine said to the doctor : -- `` Well ? '' 
`` Has she not a child which she desires to see ? '' 
said the doctor . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
Make haste and get it here ! '' 
M. Madeleine shuddered . 
Fantine inquired : -- `` What did the doctor say ? '' 
M. Madeleine forced himself to smile . 
`` He said that your child was to be brought speedily . 
That that would restore your health . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
she rejoined , `` he is right ! 
But what do those Thenardiers mean by keeping my Cosette from me ! 
Oh ! 
she is coming . 
At last I behold happiness close beside me ! '' 
In the meantime Thenardier did not `` let go of the child , '' and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it . 
Cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter . 
And then , there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood , and they were collecting the bills for them , etc. , etc. `` I shall send some one to fetch Cosette ! '' 
said Father Madeleine . 
`` If necessary , I will go myself . '' 
He wrote the following letter to Fantine 's dictation , and made her sign it : -- `` MONSIEUR THENARDIER : -- You will deliver Cosette to this person . 
You will be paid for all the little things . 
I have the honor to salute you with respect . 
`` FANTINE . ''
