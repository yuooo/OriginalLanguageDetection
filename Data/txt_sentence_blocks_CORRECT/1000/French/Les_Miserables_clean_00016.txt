`` The rendezvous is appointed outside , '' said Theodule . 
`` Let 's have a look at the lass . '' 
And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Marius had turned . 
On arriving there , he halted in amazement . 
Marius , with his forehead clasped in his hands , was kneeling upon the grass on a grave . 
He had strewn his bouquet there . 
At the extremity of the grave , on a little swelling which marked the head , there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters : COLONEL BARON PONTMERCY . 
Marius ' sobs were audible . 
The `` lass '' was a grave . 
MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from Paris . 
It was hither that he had come every time that M. Gillenormand had said : `` He is sleeping out . '' 
Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre ; he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing , and which was composed of respect for the tomb , mingled with respect for the colonel . 
He retreated , leaving Marius alone in the cemetery , and there was discipline in this retreat . 
Death appeared to him with large epaulets , and he almost made the military salute to him . 
Not knowing what to write to his aunt , he decided not to write at all ; and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by Theodule as to the love affairs of Marius , if , by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance , the scene at Vernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris . 
Marius returned from Vernon on the third day , in the middle of the morning , descended at his grandfather 's door , and , wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence , and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school , he mounted rapidly to his chamber , took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat , and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck , and went off to the bath . 
M.Gillenormand , who had risen betimes like all old men in good health , had heard his entrance , and had made haste to climb , as quickly as his old legs permitted , the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived , in order to embrace him , and to question him while so doing , and to find out where he had been . 
But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend , and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic , Marius was no longer there . 
The bed had not been disturbed , and on the bed lay , outspread , but not defiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon . 
`` I like this better , '' said M. Gillenormand . 
And a moment later , he made his entrance into the salon , where Mademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated , busily embroidering her cart-wheels . 
The entrance was a triumphant one . 
M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat , and in the other the neck-ribbon , and exclaimed : -- `` Victory ! 
We are about to penetrate the mystery ! 
We are going to learn the most minute details ; we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend ! 
Here we have the romance itself . 
I have the portrait ! '' 
In fact , a case of black shagreen , resembling a medallion portrait , was suspended from the ribbon . 
The old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it , with that air of enjoyment , rapture , and wrath , with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him , pass under his very nose . 
`` For this evidently is a portrait . 
I know all about such things . 
That is worn tenderly on the heart . 
How stupid they are ! 
Some abominable fright that will make us shudder , probably ! 
Young men have such bad taste nowadays ! '' 
`` Let us see , father , '' said the old spinster . 
The case opened by the pressure of a spring . 
They found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper . 
`` From the same to the same , '' said M. Gillenormand , bursting with laughter . 
`` I know what it is . 
A billet-doux . '' 
`` Ah ! 
let us read it ! '' 
said the aunt . 
And she put on her spectacles . 
They unfolded the paper and read as follows : -- `` For my son . 
-- The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of Waterloo . 
Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I purchased with my blood , my son shall take it and bear it . 
That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course . '' 
The feelings of father and daughter can not be described . 
They felt chilled as by the breath of a death 's - head . 
They did not exchange a word . 
Only , M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself : -- `` It is the slasher 's handwriting . '' 
The aunt examined the paper , turned it about in all directions , then put it back in its case . 
At the same moment a little oblong packet , enveloped in blue paper , fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat . 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper . 
It contained Marius ' hundred cards . 
She handed one of them to M. Gillenormand , who read : Le Baron Marius Pontmercy . 
The old man rang the bell . 
Nicolette came . 
M. Gillenormand took the ribbon , the case , and the coat , flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room , and said : -- `` Carry those duds away . '' 
A full hour passed in the most profound silence . 
The old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other , and were thinking , each on his own account , the same things , in all probability . 
At the expiration of this hour , Aunt Gillenormand said : -- `` A pretty state of things ! '' 
A few moments later , Marius made his appearance . 
He entered . 
Even before he had crossed the threshold , he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand , and on catching sight of him , the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing : -- `` Well ! 
well ! 
well ! 
well ! 
well ! 
so you are a baron now . 
I present you my compliments . 
What is the meaning of this ? '' 
Marius reddened slightly and replied : -- `` It means that I am the son of my father . '' 
M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh , and said harshly : -- `` I am your father . '' 
`` My father , '' retorted Marius , with downcast eyes and a severe air , `` was a humble and heroic man , who served the Republic and France gloriously , who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made , who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century , beneath grape-shot and bullets , in snow and mud by day , beneath rain at night , who captured two flags , who received twenty wounds , who died forgotten and abandoned , and who never committed but one mistake , which was to love too fondly two ingrates , his country and myself . '' 
This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear . 
At the word republic , he rose , or , to speak more correctly , he sprang to his feet . 
Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand . 
From a dull hue he had turned red , from red , purple , and from purple , flame-colored . 
`` Marius ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Abominable child ! 
I do not know what your father was ! 
I do not wish to know ! 
I know nothing about that , and I do not know him ! 
But what I do know is , that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men ! 
They were all rascals , assassins , red-caps , thieves ! 
I say all ! 
I say all ! 
I know not one ! 
I say all ! 
Do you hear me , Marius ! 
See here , you are no more a baron than my slipper is ! 
They were all bandits in the service of Robespierre ! 
All who served B-u-o-naparte were brigands ! 
They were all traitors who betrayed , betrayed , betrayed their legitimate king ! 
All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the English at Waterloo ! 
That is what I do know ! 
Whether Monsieur your father comes in that category , I do not know ! 
I am sorry for it , so much the worse , your humble servant ! '' 
In his turn , it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand who was the bellows . 
Marius quivered in every limb , he did not know what would happen next , his brain was on fire . 
He was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds , the fakir who beholds a passer-by spit upon his idol . 
It could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence . 
What was he to do ? 
His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence , but by whom ? 
By his grandfather . 
How was he to avenge the one without outraging the other ? 
It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged . 
On the one hand was a sacred grave , on the other hoary locks . 
He stood there for several moments , staggering as though intoxicated , with all this whirlwind dashing through his head ; then he raised his eyes , gazed fixedly at his grandfather , and cried in a voice of thunder : -- `` Down with the Bourbons , and that great hog of a Louis XVIII . ! '' 
Louis XVIII . 
had been dead for four years ; but it was all the same to him . 
The old man , who had been crimson , turned whiter than his hair . 
He wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry , which stood on the chimney-piece , and made a profound bow , with a sort of peculiar majesty . 
Then he paced twice , slowly and in silence , from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace , traversing the whole length of the room , and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking . 
On his second turn , he bent over his daughter , who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb , and said to her with a smile that was almost calm : `` A baron like this gentleman , and a bourgeois like myself can not remain under the same roof . '' 
And drawing himself up , all at once , pallid , trembling , terrible , with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath , he extended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him : -- `` Be off ! '' 
Marius left the house . 
On the following day , M. Gillenormand said to his daughter : `` You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker , and you will never mention his name to me . '' 
Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of , and not knowing what to do with it , he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months . 
Marius , on his side , had gone forth in indignation . 
There was one circumstance which , it must be admitted , aggravated his exasperation . 
There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas . 
They augment the grievances in such cases , although , in reality , the wrongs are not increased by them . 
While carrying Marius ' `` duds '' precipitately to his chamber , at his grandfather 's command , Nicolette had , inadvertently , let fall , probably , on the attic staircase , which was dark , that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel . 
Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found . 
Marius was convinced that `` Monsieur Gillenormand '' -- from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise -- had flung `` his father 's testament '' in the fire . 
He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written , and , consequently , nothing was lost . 
But the paper , the writing , that sacred relic , -- all that was his very heart . 
What had been done with it ? 
Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going , and without knowing where , with thirty francs , his watch , and a few clothes in a hand-bag . 
He had entered a hackney-coach , had engaged it by the hour , and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin quarter . 
What was to become of Marius ? 
A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC At that epoch , which was , to all appearances indifferent , a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current . 
Breaths which had started forth from the depths of '89 and '93 were in the air . 
Youth was on the point , may the reader pardon us the word , of moulting . 
People were undergoing a transformation , almost without being conscious of it , through the movement of the age . 
The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls . 
Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take . 
The Royalists were becoming liberals , liberals were turning democrats . 
It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements ; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures ; hence the combination of very singular ideas ; people adored both Napoleon and liberty . 
We are making history here . 
These were the mirages of that period . 
Opinions traverse phases . 
Voltairian royalism , a quaint variety , had a no less singular sequel , Bonapartist liberalism . 
Other groups of minds were more serious . 
In that direction , they sounded principles , they attached themselves to the right . 
They grew enthusiastic for the absolute , they caught glimpses of infinite realizations ; the absolute , by its very rigidity , urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space . 
There is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams . 
And there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future . 
Utopia to-day , flesh and blood to-morrow . 
These advanced opinions had a double foundation . 
A beginning of mystery menaced `` the established order of things , '' which was suspicious and underhand . 
A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree . 
The second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine . 
The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat . 
There did not , as yet , exist in France any of those vast underlying organizations , like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism ; but here and there there were dark underminings , which were in process of throwing off shoots . 
The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix ; there existed at Paris , among other affiliations of that nature , the society of the Friends of the A B C . 
What were these Friends of the A B C ? 
A society which had for its object apparently the education of children , in reality the elevation of man . 
They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C , -- the Abaisse , -- the debased , -- that is to say , the people . 
They wished to elevate the people . 
It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at . 
Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics ; witness the Castratus ad castra , which made a general of the army of Narses ; witness : Barbari et Barberini ; witness : Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram , etc. , etc. . 
The Friends of the A B C were not numerous , it was a secret society in the state of embryo , we might almost say a coterie , if coteries ended in heroes . 
They assembled in Paris in two localities , near the fish-market , in a wine-shop called Corinthe , of which more will be heard later on , and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe Musain , now torn down ; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman , the second to the students . 
The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back room of the Cafe Musain . 
This hall , which was tolerably remote from the cafe , with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor , had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres . 
There they smoked and drank , and gambled and laughed . 
There they conversed in very loud tones about everything , and in whispers of other things . 
An old map of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall , -- a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent . 
The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students , who were on cordial terms with the working classes . 
Here are the names of the principal ones . 
They belong , in a certain measure , to history : Enjolras , Combeferre , Jean Prouvaire , Feuilly , Courfeyrac , Bahorel , Lesgle or Laigle , Joly , Grantaire . 
These young men formed a sort of family , through the bond of friendship . 
All , with the exception of Laigle , were from the South . 
This was a remarkable group . 
It vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us . 
At the point of this drama which we have now reached , it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads , before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure . 
Enjolras , whose name we have mentioned first of all , -- the reader shall see why later on , -- was an only son and wealthy . 
Enjolras was a charming young man , who was capable of being terrible . 
He was angelically handsome . 
He was a savage Antinous . 
One would have said , to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance , that he had already , in some previous state of existence , traversed the revolutionary apocalypse . 
He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness . 
He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair . 
A pontifical and warlike nature , a singular thing in a youth . 
He was an officiating priest and a man of war ; from the immediate point of view , a soldier of the democracy ; above the contemporary movement , the priest of the ideal . 
His eyes were deep , his lids a little red , his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful , his brow was lofty . 
A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view . 
Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last , who became illustrious at an early age , he was endowed with excessive youth , and was as rosy as a young girl , although subject to hours of pallor . 
Already a man , he still seemed a child . 
His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen ; he was serious , it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman . 
He had but one passion -- the right ; but one thought -- to overthrow the obstacle . 
On Mount Aventine , he would have been Gracchus ; in the Convention , he would have been Saint-Just . 
He hardly saw the roses , he ignored spring , he did not hear the carolling of the birds ; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton ; he , like Harmodius , thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword . 
He was severe in his enjoyments . 
He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic . 
He was the marble lover of liberty . 
His speech was harshly inspired , and had the thrill of a hymn . 
He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul . 
Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him ! 
If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais , seeing that face of a youth escaped from college , that page 's mien , those long , golden lashes , those blue eyes , that hair billowing in the wind , those rosy cheeks , those fresh lips , those exquisite teeth , had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora , and had tried her beauty on Enjolras , an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss , and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais . 
By the side of Enjolras , who represented the logic of the Revolution , Combeferre represented its philosophy . 
Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference -- that its logic may end in war , whereas its philosophy can end only in peace . 
Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras . 
He was less lofty , but broader . 
He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas : he said : `` Revolution , but civilization '' ; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky . 
The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras . 
Enjolras expressed its divine right , and Combeferre its natural right . 
The first attached himself to Robespierre ; the second confined himself to Condorcet . 
Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras . 
If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history , the one would have been the just , the other the wise man . 
Enjolras was the more virile , Combeferre the more humane . 
Homo and vir , that was the exact effect of their different shades . 
Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe , through natural whiteness . 
He loved the word citizen , but he preferred the word man . 
He would gladly have said : Hombre , like the Spanish . 
He read everything , went to the theatres , attended the courses of public lecturers , learned the polarization of light from Arago , grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the external carotid artery , and the internal , the one which makes the face , and the one which makes the brain ; he kept up with what was going on , followed science step by step , compared Saint-Simon with Fourier , deciphered hieroglyphics , broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology , drew from memory a silkworm moth , pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy , studied Puysegur and Deleuze , affirmed nothing , not even miracles ; denied nothing , not even ghosts ; turned over the files of the Moniteur , reflected . 
He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster , and busied himself with educational questions . 
He desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level , at coining science , at putting ideas into circulation , at increasing the mind in youthful persons , and he feared lest the present poverty of method , the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic , the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants , scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds . 
He was learned , a purist , exact , a graduate of the Polytechnic , a close student , and at the same time , thoughtful `` even to chimaeras , '' so his friends said . 
He believed in all dreams , railroads , the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations , the fixing of images in the dark chamber , the electric telegraph , the steering of balloons . 
Moreover , he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction , by superstition , despotism , and prejudice . 
He was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position . 
Enjolras was a chief , Combeferre was a guide . 
One would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other . 
It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting , he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle , and to attack it by main force and explosively ; but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually , by means of education , the inculcation of axioms , the promulgation of positive laws ; and , between two lights , his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration . 
A conflagration can create an aurora , no doubt , but why not await the dawn ? 
A volcano illuminates , but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination . 
Possibly , Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime . 
A light troubled by smoke , progress purchased at the expense of violence , only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit . 
The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth , a ' 93 , terrified him ; nevertheless , stagnation was still more repulsive to him , in it he detected putrefaction and death ; on the whole , he preferred scum to miasma , and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool , and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon . 
In short , he desired neither halt nor haste . 
While his tumultuous friends , captivated by the absolute , adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures , Combeferre was inclined to let progress , good progress , take its own course ; he may have been cold , but he was pure ; methodical , but irreproachable ; phlegmatic , but imperturbable . 
Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor , and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races . 
The good must be innocent , he repeated incessantly . 
And in fact , if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view , and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings , with fire and blood in its talons , the beauty of progress lies in being spotless ; and there exists between Washington , who represents the one , and Danton , who incarnates the other , that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle . 
Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre . 
His name was Jehan , owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the Middle Ages . 
Jean Prouvaire was in love ; he cultivated a pot of flowers , played on the flute , made verses , loved the people , pitied woman , wept over the child , confounded God and the future in the same confidence , and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head , that of Andre Chenier . 
His voice was ordinarily delicate , but suddenly grew manly . 
He was learned even to erudition , and almost an Orientalist . 
Above all , he was good ; and , a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur , in the matter of poetry , he preferred the immense . 
He knew Italian , Latin , Greek , and Hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : Dante , Juvenal , AEschylus , and Isaiah . 
In French , he preferred Corneille to Racine , and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille . 
He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers , and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events . 
His mind had two attitudes , one on the side towards man , the other on that towards God ; he studied or he contemplated . 
All day long , he buried himself in social questions , salary , capital , credit , marriage , religion , liberty of thought , education , penal servitude , poverty , association , property , production and sharing , the enigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness ; and at night , he gazed upon the planets , those enormous beings . 
Like Enjolras , he was wealthy and an only son . 
He spoke softly , bowed his head , lowered his eyes , smiled with embarrassment , dressed badly , had an awkward air , blushed at a mere nothing , and was very timid . 
Yet he was intrepid . 
Feuilly was a workingman , a fan-maker , orphaned both of father and mother , who earned with difficulty three francs a day , and had but one thought , to deliver the world . 
He had one other preoccupation , to educate himself ; he called this also , delivering himself . 
He had taught himself to read and write ; everything that he knew , he had learned by himself . 
Feuilly had a generous heart . 
The range of his embrace was immense . 
This orphan had adopted the peoples . 
As his mother had failed him , he meditated on his country . 
He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case . 
In this club of young Utopians , occupied chiefly with France , he represented the outside world . 
He had for his specialty Greece , Poland , Hungary , Roumania , Italy . 
He uttered these names incessantly , appropriately and inappropriately , with the tenacity of right . 
The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly , of Russia on Warsaw , of Austria on Venice , enraged him . 
Above all things , the great violence of 1772 aroused him . 
There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation ; he was eloquent with that eloquence . 
He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772 , on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason , and that three-sided crime , on that monstrous ambush , the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states , which , since that time , have struck many a noble nation , and have annulled their certificate of birth , so to speak . 
All contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland . 
The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries . 
There has not been a despot , nor a traitor for nearly a century back , who has not signed , approved , counter-signed , and copied , ne variatur , the partition of Poland . 
When the record of modern treasons was examined , that was the first thing which made its appearance . 
The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own . 
1772 sounded the onset ; 1815 was the death of the game . 
Such was Feuilly 's habitual text . 
This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice , and she recompensed him by rendering him great . 
The fact is , that there is eternity in right . 
Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton . 
Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so . 
Sooner or later , the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears . 
Greece becomes Greece again , Italy is once more Italy . 
The protest of right against the deed persists forever . 
The theft of a nation can not be allowed by prescription . 
These lofty deeds of rascality have no future . 
A nation can not have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief . 
Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac . 
One of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle . 
The particle , as every one knows , possesses no significance . 
But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly that poor de , that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it . 
M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin ; M. de Caumartin , M. Caumartin ; M. de Constant de Robecque , Benjamin Constant ; M. de Lafayette , M. Lafayette . 
Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest , and called himself plain Courfeyrac . 
We might almost , so far as Courfeyrac is concerned , stop here , and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains : `` For Courfeyrac , see Tholomyes . '' 
Courfeyrac had , in fact , that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind . 
Later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws . 
This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools , who pass it from hand to hand , quasi cursores , and is almost always exactly the same ; so that , as we have just pointed out , any one who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyes in 1817 . 
Only , Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow . 
Beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind , the difference between him and Tholomyes was very great . 
The latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second . 
There was in Tholomyes a district attorney , and in Courfeyrac a paladin . 
Enjolras was the chief , Combeferre was the guide , Courfeyrac was the centre . 
The others gave more light , he shed more warmth ; the truth is , that he possessed all the qualities of a centre , roundness and radiance . 
Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June , 1822 , on the occasion of the burial of young Lallemand . 
Bahorel was a good-natured mortal , who kept bad company , brave , a spendthrift , prodigal , and to the verge of generosity , talkative , and at times eloquent , bold to the verge of effrontery ; the best fellow possible ; he had daring waistcoats , and scarlet opinions ; a wholesale blusterer , that is to say , loving nothing so much as a quarrel , unless it were an uprising ; and nothing so much as an uprising , unless it were a revolution ; always ready to smash a window-pane , then to tear up the pavement , then to demolish a government , just to see the effect of it ; a student in his eleventh year . 
He had nosed about the law , but did not practise it . 
He had taken for his device : `` Never a lawyer , '' and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap . 
Every time that he passed the law-school , which rarely happened , he buttoned up his frock-coat , -- the paletot had not yet been invented , -- and took hygienic precautions . 
Of the school porter he said : `` What a fine old man ! '' 
and of the dean , M. Delvincourt : `` What a monument ! '' 
In his lectures he espied subjects for ballads , and in his professors occasions for caricature . 
He wasted a tolerably large allowance , something like three thousand francs a year , in doing nothing . 
He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son . 
He said of them : `` They are peasants and not bourgeois ; that is the reason they are intelligent . '' 
Bahorel , a man of caprice , was scattered over numerous cafes ; the others had habits , he had none . 
He sauntered . 
To stray is human . 
To saunter is Parisian . 
In reality , he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view . 
He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and other still unorganized groups , which were destined to take form later on . 
In this conclave of young heads , there was one bald member . 
The Marquis d'Avaray , whom Louis XVIII . 
made a duke for having assisted him to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated , was wont to relate , that in 1814 , on his return to France , as the King was disembarking at Calais , a man handed him a petition . 
`` What is your request ? '' 
said the King . 
`` Sire , a post-office . '' 
`` What is your name ? '' 
`` L'Aigle . '' 
The King frowned , glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus : LESGLE . 
This non-Bonoparte orthography touched the King and he began to smile . 
`` Sire , '' resumed the man with the petition , `` I had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed Lesgueules . 
This surname furnished my name . 
I am called Lesgueules , by contraction Lesgle , and by corruption l'Aigle . '' 
This caused the King to smile broadly . 
Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux , either intentionally or accidentally . 
The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle , or Legle , and he signed himself , Legle -LSB- de Meaux -RSB- . 
As an abbreviation , his companions called him Bossuet . 
Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow . 
His specialty was not to succeed in anything . 
As an offset , he laughed at everything . 
At five and twenty he was bald . 
His father had ended by owning a house and a field ; but he , the son , had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation . 
He had nothing left . 
He possessed knowledge and wit , but all he did miscarried . 
Everything failed him and everybody deceived him ; what he was building tumbled down on top of him . 
If he were splitting wood , he cut off a finger . 
If he had a mistress , he speedily discovered that he had a friend also . 
Some misfortune happened to him every moment , hence his joviality . 
He said : `` I live under falling tiles . '' 
He was not easily astonished , because , for him , an accident was what he had foreseen , he took his bad luck serenely , and smiled at the teasing of fate , like a person who is listening to pleasantries . 
He was poor , but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible . 
He soon reached his last sou , never his last burst of laughter . 
When adversity entered his doors , he saluted this old acquaintance cordially , he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach ; he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname : `` Good day , Guignon , '' he said to it . 
These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive . 
He was full of resources . 
He had no money , but he found means , when it seemed good to him , to indulge in `` unbridled extravagance . '' 
One night , he went so far as to eat a `` hundred francs '' in a supper with a wench , which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy : `` Pull off my boots , you five-louis jade . '' 
Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer ; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel . 
Bossuet had not much domicile , sometimes none at all . 
He lodged now with one , now with another , most often with Joly . 
Joly was studying medicine . 
He was two years younger than Bossuet . 
Joly was the `` malade imaginaire '' junior . 
What he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor . 
At three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian , and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror . 
He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle , and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south , and the foot to the north , so that , at night , the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe . 
During thunder storms , he felt his pulse . 
Otherwise , he was the gayest of them all . 
All these young , maniacal , puny , merry incoherences lived in harmony together , and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades , who were prodigal of winged consonants , called Jolllly . 
`` You may fly away on the four L 's , '' Jean Prouvaire said to him . 
-LSB- 23 -RSB- -LSB- 23 -RSB- L'Aile , wing . 
Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane , which is an indication of a sagacious mind . 
All these young men who differed so greatly , and who , on the whole , can only be discussed seriously , held the same religion : Progress . 
All were the direct sons of the French Revolution . 
The most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date : ' 89 . 
Their fathers in the flesh had been , either royalists , doctrinaires , it matters not what ; this confusion anterior to themselves , who were young , did not concern them at all ; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins . 
They attached themselves , without intermediate shades , to incorruptible right and absolute duty . 
Affiliated and initiated , they sketched out the ideal underground . 
Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds , there was one sceptic . 
How came he there ? 
By juxtaposition . 
This sceptic 's name was Grantaire , and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus : R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything . 
Moreover , he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris ; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Cafe Lemblin , and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire , that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage , on the Boulevard du Maine , spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget 's , excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette , and a certain thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat . 
He knew the best place for everything ; in addition , boxing and foot-fencing and some dances ; and he was a thorough single-stick player . 
He was a tremendous drinker to boot . 
He was inordinately homely : the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day , Irma Boissy , enraged with his homeliness , pronounced sentence on him as follows : `` Grantaire is impossible '' ; but Grantaire 's fatuity was not to be disconcerted . 
He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women , with the air of saying to them all : `` If I only chose ! '' 
and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand . 
All those words : rights of the people , rights of man , the social contract , the French Revolution , the Republic , democracy , humanity , civilization , religion , progress , came very near to signifying nothing whatever to Grantaire . 
He smiled at them . 
Scepticism , that caries of the intelligence , had not left him a single whole idea . 
He lived with irony . 
This was his axiom : `` There is but one certainty , my full glass . '' 
He sneered at all devotion in all parties , the father as well as the brother , Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles . 
`` They are greatly in advance to be dead , '' he exclaimed . 
He said of the crucifix : `` There is a gibbet which has been a success . '' 
A rover , a gambler , a libertine , often drunk , he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly : `` J'aimons les filles , et j' aimons le bon vin . '' 
Air : Vive Henri IV . 
However , this sceptic had one fanaticism . 
This fanaticism was neither a dogma , nor an idea , nor an art , nor a science ; it was a man : Enjolras . 
Grantaire admired , loved , and venerated Enjolras . 
To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds ? 
To the most absolute . 
In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him ? 
By his ideas ? 
No . 
By his character . 
A phenomenon which is often observable . 
A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors . 
That which we lack attracts us . 
No one loves the light like the blind man . 
The dwarf adores the drum-major . 
The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven . 
Why ? 
In order to watch the bird in its flight . 
Grantaire , in whom writhed doubt , loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras . 
He had need of Enjolras . 
That chaste , healthy , firm , upright , hard , candid nature charmed him , without his being clearly aware of it , and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him . 
He admired his opposite by instinct . 
His soft , yielding , dislocated , sickly , shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column . 
His moral backbone leaned on that firmness . 
Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more . 
He was , himself , moreover , composed of two elements , which were , to all appearance , incompatible . 
He was ironical and cordial . 
His indifference loved . 
His mind could get along without belief , but his heart could not get along without friendship . 
A profound contradiction ; for an affection is a conviction . 
His nature was thus constituted . 
There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse , the obverse , the wrong side . 
They are Pollux , Patrocles , Nisus , Eudamidas , Ephestion , Pechmeja . 
They only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man ; their name is a sequel , and is only written preceded by the conjunction and ; and their existence is not their own ; it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs . 
Grantaire was one of these men . 
He was the obverse of Enjolras . 
One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet . 
In the series O and P are inseparable . 
You can , at will , pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades . 
Grantaire , Enjolras ' true satellite , inhabited this circle of young men ; he lived there , he took no pleasure anywhere but there ; he followed them everywhere . 
His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine . 
They tolerated him on account of his good humor . 
Enjolras , the believer , disdained this sceptic ; and , a sober man himself , scorned this drunkard . 
He accorded him a little lofty pity . 
Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades . 
Always harshly treated by Enjolras , roughly repulsed , rejected yet ever returning to the charge , he said of Enjolras : `` What fine marble ! '' 
BLONDEAU 'S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET On a certain afternoon , which had , as will be seen hereafter , some coincidence with the events heretofore related , Laigle de Meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Cafe Musain . 
He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation ; he carried nothing but his revery , however . 
He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel . 
To lean one 's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect , which attitude is not hated by thinkers . 
Laigle de Meaux was pondering without melancholy , over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the law-school , and which had modified his personal plans for the future , plans which were rather indistinct in any case . 
Revery does not prevent a cab from passing by , nor the dreamer from taking note of that cab . 
Laigle de Meaux , whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging , perceived , athwart his somnambulism , a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place , at a foot pace and apparently in indecision . 
For whom was this cabriolet ? 
Why was it driving at a walk ? 
Laigle took a survey . 
In it , beside the coachman , sat a young man , and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag . 
The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff : MARIUS PONTMERCY . 
This name caused Laigle to change his attitude . 
He drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet : -- `` Monsieur Marius Pontmercy ! '' 
The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt . 
The young man , who also seemed deeply buried in thought , raised his eyes : -- `` Hey ? '' 
said he . 
`` You are M. Marius Pontmercy ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` I was looking for you , '' resumed Laigle de Meaux . 
`` How so ? '' 
demanded Marius ; for it was he : in fact , he had just quitted his grandfather 's , and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time . 
`` I do not know you . '' 
`` Neither do I know you , '' responded Laigle . 
Marius thought he had encountered a wag , the beginning of a mystification in the open street . 
He was not in a very good humor at the moment . 
He frowned . 
Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably : -- `` You were not at the school day before yesterday . '' 
`` That is possible . '' 
`` That is certain . '' 
`` You are a student ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
`` Yes , sir . 
Like yourself . 
Day before yesterday , I entered the school , by chance . 
You know , one does have such freaks sometimes . 
The professor was just calling the roll . 
You are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions . 
At the third call , unanswered , your name is erased from the list . 
Sixty francs in the gulf . '' 
Marius began to listen . 
`` It was Blondeau who was making the call . 
You know Blondeau , he has a very pointed and very malicious nose , and he delights to scent out the absent . 
He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening , not being compromised by that letter . 
The call was not going badly . 
No erasures ; the universe was present . 
Blondeau was grieved . 
I said to myself : ` Blondeau , my love , you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution to-day . ' 
All at once Blondeau calls , ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
No one answers . 
Blondeau , filled with hope , repeats more loudly : ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
And he takes his pen . 
Monsieur , I have bowels of compassion . 
I said to myself hastily : ` Here 's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out . 
Attention . 
Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact . 
He 's not a good student . 
Here is none of your heavy-sides , a student who studies , a greenhorn pedant , strong on letters , theology , science , and sapience , one of those dull wits cut by the square ; a pin by profession . 
He is an honorable idler who lounges , who practises country jaunts , who cultivates the grisette , who pays court to the fair sex , who is at this very moment , perhaps , with my mistress . 
Let us save him . 
Death to Blondeau ! ' 
At that moment , Blondeau dipped his pen in , all black with erasures in the ink , cast his yellow eyes round the audience room , and repeated for the third time : ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
I replied : ` Present ! ' 
This is why you were not crossed off . '' 
`` Monsieur ! 
-- '' said Marius . 
`` And why I was , '' added Laigle de Meaux . 
`` I do not understand you , '' said Marius . 
Laigle resumed : -- `` Nothing is more simple . 
I was close to the desk to reply , and close to the door for the purpose of flight . 
The professor gazed at me with a certain intensity . 
All of a sudden , Blondeau , who must be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau , skipped to the letter L. L is my letter . 
I am from Meaux , and my name is Lesgle . '' 
`` L'Aigle ! '' 
interrupted Marius , `` what fine name ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Blondeau came to this fine name , and called : ` Laigle ! ' 
I reply : ` Present ! ' 
Then Blondeau gazes at me , with the gentleness of a tiger , and says to me : ` lf you are Pontmercy , you are not Laigle . ' 
A phrase which has a disobliging air for you , but which was lugubrious only for me . 
That said , he crossed me off . '' 
Marius exclaimed : -- `` I am mortified , sir -- '' `` First of all , '' interposed Laigle , `` I demand permission to embalm Blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium . 
I will assume that he is dead . 
There will be no great change required in his gauntness , in his pallor , in his coldness , and in his smell . 
And I say : ` Erudimini qui judicatis terram . 
Here lies Blondeau , Blondeau the Nose , Blondeau Nasica , the ox of discipline , bos disciplinae , the bloodhound of the password , the angel of the roll-call , who was upright , square exact , rigid , honest , and hideous . 
God crossed him off as he crossed me off . ' '' 
Marius resumed : -- `` I am very sorry -- '' `` Young man , '' said Laigle de Meaux , `` let this serve you as a lesson . 
In future , be exact . '' 
`` I really beg you a thousand pardons . '' 
`` Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again . '' 
`` I am extremely sorry -- '' Laigle burst out laughing . 
`` And I am delighted . 
I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer . 
This erasure saves me . 
I renounce the triumphs of the bar . 
I shall not defend the widow , and I shall not attack the orphan . 
No more toga , no more stage . 
Here is my erasure all ready for me . 
It is to you that I am indebted for it , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you . 
Where do you live ? '' 
`` In this cab , '' said Marius . 
`` A sign of opulence , '' retorted Laigle calmly . 
`` I congratulate you . 
You have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum . '' 
At that moment , Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe . 
Marius smiled sadly . 
`` I have paid this rent for the last two hours , and I aspire to get rid of it ; but there is a sort of history attached to it , and I do n't know where to go . '' 
`` Come to my place , sir , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` I have the priority , '' observed Laigle , `` but I have no home . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Bossuet , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` Bossuet , '' said Marius , `` but I thought that your name was Laigle . '' 
`` De Meaux , '' replied Laigle ; `` by metaphor , Bossuet . '' 
Courfeyrac entered the cab . 
`` Coachman , '' said he , `` hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques . '' 
And that very evening , Marius found himself installed in a chamber of the hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac . 
MARIUS ' ASTONISHMENTS In a few days , Marius had become Courfeyrac 's friend . 
Youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars . 
Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac 's society , a decidedly new thing for him . 
Courfeyrac put no questions to him . 
He did not even think of such a thing . 
At that age , faces disclose everything on the spot . 
Words are superfluous . 
There are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter . 
One looks at them and one knows them . 
One morning , however , Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to him : -- `` By the way , have you any political opinions ? '' 
`` The idea ! '' 
said Marius , almost affronted by the question . 
`` What are you ? '' 
`` A democrat-Bonapartist . '' 
`` The gray hue of a reassured rat , '' said Courfeyrac . 
On the following day , Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Cafe Musain . 
Then he whispered in his ear , with a smile : `` I must give you your entry to the revolution . '' 
And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B C . 
He presented him to the other comrades , saying this simple word which Marius did not understand : `` A pupil . '' 
Marius had fallen into a wasps ' - nest of wits . 
However , although he was silent and grave , he was , none the less , both winged and armed . 
Marius , up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy , and to asides , both by habit and by taste , was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him . 
All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once , and pulled him about . 
The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl . 
Sometimes , in his trouble , they fled so far from him , that he had difficulty in recovering them . 
He heard them talk of philosophy , of literature , of art , of history , of religion , in unexpected fashion . 
He caught glimpses of strange aspects ; and , as he did not place them in proper perspective , he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped . 
On abandoning his grandfather 's opinions for the opinions of his father , he had supposed himself fixed ; he now suspected , with uneasiness , and without daring to avow it to himself , that he was not . 
The angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew . 
A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion . 
An odd internal upsetting . 
He almost suffered from it . 
It seemed as though there were no `` consecrated things '' for those young men . 
Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject , which embarrassed his still timid mind . 
A theatre poster presented itself , adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic : `` Down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois ! '' 
cried Bahorel . 
And Marius heard Combeferre reply : -- `` You are wrong , Bahorel . 
The bourgeoisie loves tragedy , and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score . 
Bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence , and I am not one of those who , by order of AEschylus , contest its right to existence . 
There are rough outlines in nature ; there are , in creation , ready-made parodies ; a beak which is not a beak , wings which are not wings , gills which are not gills , paws which are not paws , a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh , there is the duck . 
Now , since poultry exists by the side of the bird , I do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy . '' 
Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau between Enjolras and Courfeyrac . 
Courfeyrac took his arm : -- `` Pay attention . 
This is the Rue Platriere , now called Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau , on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago . 
This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Therese . 
From time to time , little beings were born there . 
Therese gave birth to them , Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings . '' 
And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly : -- `` Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques ! 
I admire that man . 
He denied his own children , that may be ; but he adopted the people . '' 
Not one of these young men articulated the word : The Emperor . 
Jean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon ; all the others said `` Bonaparte . '' 
Enjolras pronounced it `` Buonaparte . '' 
Marius was vaguely surprised . 
Initium sapientiae . 
THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN One of the conversations among the young men , at which Marius was present and in which he sometimes joined , was a veritable shock to his mind . 
This took place in the back room of the Cafe Musain . 
Nearly all the Friends of the A B C had convened that evening . 
The argand lamp was solemnly lighted . 
They talked of one thing and another , without passion and with noise . 
With the exception of Enjolras and Marius , who held their peace , all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard . 
Conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults . 
It was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation . 
They tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn . 
They were chattering in all quarters . 
No woman was admitted to this back room , except Louison , the dish-washer of the cafe , who passed through it from time to time , to go to her washing in the `` lavatory . '' 
Grantaire , thoroughly drunk , was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession , reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs , and shouting : -- `` I am thirsty . 
Mortals , I am dreaming : that the tun of Heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy , and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it . 
I want a drink . 
I desire to forget life . 
Life is a hideous invention of I know not whom . 
It lasts no time at all , and is worth nothing . 
One breaks one 's neck in living . 
Life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances . 
Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only . 
Ecclesiastes says : ` All is vanity . ' 
I agree with that good man , who never existed , perhaps . 
Zero not wishing to go stark naked , clothed himself in vanity . 
O vanity ! 
The patching up of everything with big words ! 
a kitchen is a laboratory , a dancer is a professor , an acrobat is a gymnast , a boxer is a pugilist , an apothecary is a chemist , a wigmaker is an artist , a hodman is an architect , a jockey is a sportsman , a wood-louse is a pterigybranche . 
Vanity has a right and a wrong side ; the right side is stupid , it is the negro with his glass beads ; the wrong side is foolish , it is the philosopher with his rags . 
I weep over the one and I laugh over the other . 
What are called honors and dignities , and even dignity and honor , are generally of pinchbeck . 
Kings make playthings of human pride . 
Caligula made a horse a consul ; Charles II . 
made a knight of a sirloin . 
Wrap yourself up now , then , between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef . 
As for the intrinsic value of people , it is no longer respectable in the least . 
Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor . 
White on white is ferocious ; if the lily could speak , what a setting down it would give the dove ! 
A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra . 
It is a shame that I am ignorant , otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things ; but I know nothing . 
For instance , I have always been witty ; when I was a pupil of Gros , instead of daubing wretched little pictures , I passed my time in pilfering apples ; rapin -LSB- 24 -RSB- is the masculine of rapine . 
So much for myself ; as for the rest of you , you are worth no more than I am . 
I scoff at your perfections , excellencies , and qualities . 
Every good quality tends towards a defect ; economy borders on avarice , the generous man is next door to the prodigal , the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart ; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted ; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes ' cloak . 
Whom do you admire , the slain or the slayer , Caesar or Brutus ? 
Generally men are in favor of the slayer . 
Long live Brutus , he has slain ! 
There lies the virtue . 
Virtue , granted , but madness also . 
There are queer spots on those great men . 
The Brutus who killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy . 
This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion , who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg , Eucnemos , which Nero carried with him in his travels . 
This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord . 
Brutus was in love with the one , Nero with the other . 
All history is nothing but wearisome repetition . 
One century is the plagiarist of the other . 
The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna ; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water . 
I do n't attach much importance to victory . 
Nothing is so stupid as to conquer ; true glory lies in convincing . 
But try to prove something ! 
If you are content with success , what mediocrity , and with conquering , what wretchedness ! 
Alas , vanity and cowardice everywhere . 
Everything obeys success , even grammar . 
Si volet usus , says Horace . 
Therefore I disdain the human race . 
Shall we descend to the party at all ? 
Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples ? 
What people , if you please ? 
Shall it be Greece ? 
The Athenians , those Parisians of days gone by , slew Phocion , as we might say Coligny , and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus : `` His urine attracts the bees . '' 
The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas , who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind . 
There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny ; this statue represented Episthates . 
What did Episthates do ? 
He invented a trip . 
That sums up Greece and glory . 
Let us pass on to others . 
Shall I admire England ? 
Shall I admire France ? 
France ? 
Why ? 
Because of Paris ? 
I have just told you my opinion of Athens . 
England ? 
Why ? 
Because of London ? 
I hate Carthage . 
And then , London , the metropolis of luxury , is the headquarters of wretchedness . 
There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone . 
Such is Albion . 
I add , as the climax , that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles . 
A fig then for England ! 
If I do not admire John Bull , shall I admire Brother Jonathan ? 
I have but little taste for that slave-holding brother . 
Take away Time is money , what remains of England ? 
Take away Cotton is king , what remains of America ? 
Germany is the lymph , Italy is the bile . 
Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia ? 
Voltaire admired it . 
He also admired China . 
I admit that Russia has its beauties , among others , a stout despotism ; but I pity the despots . 
Their health is delicate . 
A decapitated Alexis , a poignarded Peter , a strangled Paul , another Paul crushed flat with kicks , divers Ivans strangled , with their throats cut , numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned , all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity . 
All civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker ; war ; now , war , civilized war , exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism , from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass . 
` Bah ! ' 
you will say to me , ` but Europe is certainly better than Asia ? ' 
I admit that Asia is a farce ; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand Lama , you peoples of the west , who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty , from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin . 
Gentlemen of the human race , I tell you , not a bit of it ! 
It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed , at Stockholm the most brandy , at Madrid the most chocolate , at Amsterdam the most gin , at London the most wine , at Constantinople the most coffee , at Paris the most absinthe ; there are all the useful notions . 
Paris carries the day , in short . 
In Paris , even the rag-pickers are sybarites ; Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Piraeus . 
Learn this in addition ; the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines ; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House . 
Hence , tea-gardens , goguettes , caboulots , bouibuis , mastroquets , bastringues , manezingues , bibines of the rag-pickers , caravanseries of the caliphs , I certify to you , I am a voluptuary , I eat at Richard 's at forty sous a head , I must have Persian carpets to roll naked Cleopatra in ! 
Where is Cleopatra ? 
Ah ! 
So it is you , Louison . 
Good day . '' 
-LSB- 24 -RSB- The slang term for a painter 's assistant . 
Thus did Grantaire , more than intoxicated , launch into speech , catching at the dish-washer in her passage , from his corner in the back room of the Cafe Musain . 
Bossuet , extending his hand towards him , tried to impose silence on him , and Grantaire began again worse than ever : -- `` Aigle de Meaux , down with your paws . 
You produce on me no effect with your gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes ' bric-a-brac . 
I excuse you from the task of soothing me . 
Moreover , I am sad . 
What do you wish me to say to you ? 
Man is evil , man is deformed ; the butterfly is a success , man is a failure . 
God made a mistake with that animal . 
A crowd offers a choice of ugliness . 
The first comer is a wretch , Femme -- woman -- rhymes with infame , -- infamous . 
Yes , I have the spleen , complicated with melancholy , with homesickness , plus hypochondria , and I am vexed and I rage , and I yawn , and I am bored , and I am tired to death , and I am stupid ! 
Let God go to the devil ! '' 
`` Silence then , capital R ! '' 
resumed Bossuet , who was discussing a point of law behind the scenes , and who was plunged more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang , of which this is the conclusion : -- '' -- And as for me , although I am hardly a legist , and at the most , an amateur attorney , I maintain this : that , in accordance with the terms of the customs of Normandy , at Saint-Michel , and for each year , an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor , saving the rights of others , and by all and several , the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance , and that , for all emphyteuses , leases , freeholds , contracts of domain , mortgages -- '' `` Echo , plaintive nymph , '' hummed Grantaire . 
Near Grantaire , an almost silent table , a sheet of paper , an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy , announced that a vaudeville was being sketched out . 
This great affair was being discussed in a low voice , and the two heads at work touched each other : `` Let us begin by finding names . 
When one has the names , one finds the subject . '' 
`` That is true . 
Dictate . 
I will write . '' 
`` Monsieur Dorimon . '' 
`` An independent gentleman ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` His daughter , Celestine . '' '' 
-- tine . 
What next ? '' 
`` Colonel Sainval . '' 
`` Sainval is stale . 
I should say Valsin . '' 
Beside the vaudeville aspirants , another group , which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low , was discussing a duel . 
An old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen , and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with . 
`` The deuce ! 
Look out for yourself . 
He is a fine swordsman . 
His play is neat . 
He has the attack , no wasted feints , wrist , dash , lightning , a just parade , mathematical parries , bigre ! 
and he is left-handed . '' 
In the angle opposite Grantaire , Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes , and talking of love . 
`` You are in luck , that you are , '' Joly was saying . 
`` You have a mistress who is always laughing . '' 
`` That is a fault of hers , '' returned Bahorel . 
`` One 's mistress does wrong to laugh . 
That encourages one to deceive her . 
To see her gay removes your remorse ; if you see her sad , your conscience pricks you . '' 
`` Ingrate ! 
a woman who laughs is such a good thing ! 
And you never quarrel ! '' 
`` That is because of the treaty which we have made . 
On forming our little Holy Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier , which we never cross . 
What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud , on the side of the wind to Gex . 
Hence the peace . '' 
`` Peace is happiness digesting . '' 
`` And you , Jolllly , where do you stand in your entanglement with Mamselle -- you know whom I mean ? '' 
`` She sulks at me with cruel patience . '' 
`` Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
`` In your place , I would let her alone . '' 
`` That is easy enough to say . '' 
`` And to do . 
Is not her name Musichetta ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Ah ! 
my poor Bahorel , she is a superb girl , very literary , with tiny feet , little hands , she dresses well , and is white and dimpled , with the eyes of a fortune-teller . 
I am wild over her . '' 
`` My dear fellow , then in order to please her , you must be elegant , and produce effects with your knees . 
Buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at Staub 's . 
That will assist . '' 
`` At what price ? '' 
shouted Grantaire . 
The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion . 
Pagan mythology was giving battle to Christian mythology . 
The question was about Olympus , whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire , out of pure romanticism . 
Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose . 
Once excited , he burst forth , a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm , and he was at once both laughing and lyric . 
`` Let us not insult the gods , '' said he . 
`` The gods may not have taken their departure . 
Jupiter does not impress me as dead . 
The gods are dreams , you say . 
Well , even in nature , such as it is to-day , after the flight of these dreams , we still find all the grand old pagan myths . 
Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel , like the Vignemale , for example , is still to me the headdress of Cybele ; it has not been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows , stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers , and I have always believed that Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache . '' 
In the last corner , they were talking politics . 
The Charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled . 
Combeferre was upholding it weakly . 
Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it . 
On the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter . 
Courfeyrac had seized it , and was brandishing it , mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper . 
`` In the first place , I wo n't have any kings ; if it were only from an economical point of view , I do n't want any ; a king is a parasite . 
One does not have kings gratis . 
Listen to this : the dearness of kings . 
At the death of Francois I. , the national debt of France amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres ; at the death of Louis XIV . 
it was two milliards , six hundred millions , at twenty-eight livres the mark , which was equivalent in 1760 , according to Desmarets , to four milliards , five hundred millions , which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards . 
In the second place , and no offence to Combeferre , a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization . 
To save the transition , to soften the passage , to deaden the shock , to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional fictions , -- what detestable reasons all those are ! 
No ! 
no ! 
let us never enlighten the people with false daylight . 
Principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar . 
No illegitimacy , no compromise , no grant from the king to the people . 
In all such grants there is an Article 14 . 
By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back . 
I refuse your charter point-blank . 
A charter is a mask ; the lie lurks beneath it . 
A people which accepts a charter abdicates . 
The law is only the law when entire . 
No ! 
no charter ! '' 
It was winter ; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace . 
This was tempting , and Courfeyrac could not resist . 
He crumpled the poor Touquet Charter in his fist , and flung it in the fire . 
The paper flashed up . 
Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII . 
burn philosophically , and contented himself with saying : -- `` The charter metamorphosed into flame . '' 
And sarcasms , sallies , jests , that French thing which is called entrain , and that English thing which is called humor , good and bad taste , good and bad reasons , all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue , mounting together and crossing from all points of the room , produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads . 
ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON The shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable property , that one can never foresee the spark , nor divine the lightning flash . 
What will dart out presently ? 
No one knows . 
The burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling . 
At the moment of jest , the serious makes its entry . 
Impulses depend on the first chance word . 
The spirit of each is sovereign , jest suffices to open the field to the unexpected . 
These are conversations with abrupt turns , in which the perspective changes suddenly . 
Chance is the stage-manager of such conversations . 
A severe thought , starting oddly from a clash of words , suddenly traversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire , Bahorel , Prouvaire , Bossuet , Combeferre , and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing . 
How does a phrase crop up in a dialogue ? 
Whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it ? 
We have just said , that no one knows anything about it . 
In the midst of the uproar , Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre , with this date : -- `` June 18th , 1815 , Waterloo . '' 
At this name of Waterloo , Marius , who was leaning his elbows on a table , beside a glass of water , removed his wrist from beneath his chin , and began to gaze fixedly at the audience . 
`` Pardieu ! '' 
exclaimed Courfeyrac -LRB- `` Parbleu '' was falling into disuse at this period -RRB- , `` that number 18 is strange and strikes me . 
It is Bonaparte 's fatal number . 
Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind , you have the whole destiny of the man , with this significant peculiarity , that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement . '' 
Enjolras , who had remained mute up to that point , broke the silence and addressed this remark to Combeferre : -- `` You mean to say , the crime and the expiation . '' 
This word crime overpassed the measure of what Marius , who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo , could accept . 
He rose , walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall , and at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment , laid his finger on this compartment and said : -- `` Corsica , a little island which has rendered France very great . '' 
This was like a breath of icy air . 
All ceased talking . 
They felt that something was on the point of occurring . 
Bahorel , replying to Bossuet , was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted . 
He gave it up to listen . 
Enjolras , whose blue eye was not fixed on any one , and who seemed to be gazing at space , replied , without glancing at Marius : -- `` France needs no Corsica to be great . 
France is great because she is France . 
Quia nomina leo . '' 
Marius felt no desire to retreat ; he turned towards Enjolras , and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being : -- `` God forbid that I should diminish France ! 
But amalgamating Napoleon with her is not diminishing her . 
Come ! 
let us argue the question . 
I am a new comer among you , but I will confess that you amaze me . 
Where do we stand ? 
Who are we ? 
Who are you ? 
Who am I ? 
Let us come to an explanation about the Emperor . 
I hear you say Buonaparte , accenting the u like the Royalists . 
I warn you that my grandfather does better still ; he says Buonaparte ' . 
I thought you were young men . 
Where , then , is your enthusiasm ? 
And what are you doing with it ? 
Whom do you admire , if you do not admire the Emperor ? 
And what more do you want ? 
If you will have none of that great man , what great men would you like ? 
He had everything . 
He was complete . 
He had in his brain the sum of human faculties . 
He made codes like Justinian , he dictated like Caesar , his conversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal , with the thunderclap of Tacitus , he made history and he wrote it , his bulletins are Iliads , he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of Mahomet , he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids , at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty , at the Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace , in the Council of State be held his own against Merlin , he gave a soul to the geometry of the first , and to the chicanery of the last , he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers ; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles , he went to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel ; he saw everything ; he knew everything ; which did not prevent him from laughing good-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child ; and all at once , frightened Europe lent an ear , armies put themselves in motion , parks of artillery rumbled , pontoons stretched over the rivers , clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm , cries , trumpets , a trembling of thrones in every direction , the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map , the sound of a superhuman sword was heard , as it was drawn from its sheath ; they beheld him , him , rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand , and a glow in his eyes , unfolding amid the thunder , his two wings , the grand army and the old guard , and he was the archangel of war ! '' 
All held their peace , and Enjolras bowed his head . 
Silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence , of the enemy being driven to the wall . 
Marius continued with increased enthusiasm , and almost without pausing for breath : -- `` Let us be just , my friends ! 
What a splendid destiny for a nation to be the Empire of such an Emperor , when that nation is France and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man ! 
To appear and to reign , to march and to triumph , to have for halting-places all capitals , to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them , to decree the falls of dynasties , and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge ; to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God ; to follow in a single man , Hannibal , Caesar , Charlemagne ; to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in the morning , to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever , Marengo , Arcola , Austerlitz , Jena , Wagram ! 
To cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries , to make the French Empire a pendant to the Roman Empire , to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army , to make its legions fly forth over all the earth , as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer , to dominate , to strike with lightning , to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory , to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans , to conquer the world twice , by conquest and by dazzling , that is sublime ; and what greater thing is there ? '' 
`` To be free , '' said Combeferre . 
Marius lowered his head in his turn ; that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel , and he felt it vanishing within him . 
When he raised his eyes , Combeferre was no longer there . 
Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis , he had just taken his departure , and all , with the exception of Enjolras , had followed him . 
The room had been emptied . 
Enjolras , left alone with Marius , was gazing gravely at him . 
Marius , however , having rallied his ideas to some extent , did not consider himself beaten ; there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point , no doubt , of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras , when all of a sudden , they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went . 
It was Combeferre , and this is what he was singing : -- `` Si Cesar m ` avait donne -LSB- 25 -RSB- La gloire et la guerre , Et qu'il me fallait quitter L'amour de ma mere , Je dirais au grand Cesar : Reprends ton sceptre et ton char , J'aime mieux ma mere , o gue ! 
J'aime mieux ma mere ! '' 
-LSB- 25 -RSB- If Cesar had given me glory and war , and I were obliged to quit my mother 's love , I would say to great Caesar , `` Take back thy sceptre and thy chariot ; I prefer the love of my mother . '' 
The wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated to this couplet a sort of strange grandeur . 
Marius , thoughtfully , and with his eyes diked on the ceiling , repeated almost mechanically : `` My mother ? 
-- '' At that moment , he felt Enjolras ' hand on his shoulder . 
`` Citizen , '' said Enjolras to him , `` my mother is the Republic . '' 
RES ANGUSTA That evening left Marius profoundly shaken , and with a melancholy shadow in his soul . 
He felt what the earth may possibly feel , at the moment when it is torn open with the iron , in order that grain may be deposited within it ; it feels only the wound ; the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later . 
Marius was gloomy . 
He had but just acquired a faith ; must he then reject it already ? 
He affirmed to himself that he would not . 
He declared to himself that he would not doubt , and he began to doubt in spite of himself . 
To stand between two religions , from one of which you have not as yet emerged , and another into which you have not yet entered , is intolerable ; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls . 
Marius was clear-eyed , and he required the true light . 
The half-lights of doubt pained him . 
Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was , he could not halt there , he was irresistibly constrained to continue , to advance , to examine , to think , to march further . 
Whither would this lead him ? 
He feared , after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father , to now take a step which should estrange him from that father . 
His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him . 
An escarpment rose around him . 
He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends ; daring in the eyes of the one , he was behind the times in the eyes of the others , and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated , on the side of age and on the side of youth . 
He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain . 
In the troubled state of his conscience , he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence . 
The realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten . 
They soon elbowed him abruptly . 
One morning , the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius ' room and said to him : -- `` Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` But I must have my money . '' 
`` Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me , '' said Marius . 
Courfeyrac having made his appearance , the host left them . 
Marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate , that he was the same as alone in the world , and had no relatives . 
`` What is to become of you ? '' 
said Courfeyrac . 
`` I do not know in the least , '' replied Marius . 
`` What are you going to do ? '' 
`` I do not know . '' 
`` Have you any money ? '' 
`` Fifteen francs . '' 
`` Do you want me to lend you some ? '' 
`` Never . '' 
`` Have you clothes ? '' 
`` Here is what I have . '' 
`` Have you trinkets ? '' 
`` A watch . '' 
`` Silver ? '' 
`` Gold ; here it is . '' 
`` I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of trousers . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
`` You will then have only a pair of trousers , a waistcoat , a hat and a coat . '' 
`` And my boots . '' 
`` What ! 
you will not go barefoot ? 
What opulence ! '' 
`` That will be enough . '' 
`` I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
`` No ; it is not good . 
What will you do after that ? '' 
`` Whatever is necessary . 
Anything honest , that is to say . '' 
`` Do you know English ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Do you know German ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` So much the worse . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because one of my friends , a publisher , is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia , for which you might have translated English or German articles . 
It is badly paid work , but one can live by it . '' 
`` I will learn English and German . '' 
`` And in the meanwhile ? '' 
`` In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch . '' 
The clothes-dealer was sent for . 
He paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments . 
They went to the watchmaker 's . 
He bought the watch for forty-five francs . 
`` That is not bad , '' said Marius to Courfeyrac , on their return to the hotel , `` with my fifteen francs , that makes eighty . '' 
`` And the hotel bill ? '' 
observed Courfeyrac . 
`` Hello , I had forgotten that , '' said Marius . 
The landlord presented his bill , which had to be paid on the spot . 
It amounted to seventy francs . 
`` I have ten francs left , '' said Marius . 
`` The deuce , '' exclaimed Courfeyrac , `` you will eat up five francs while you are learning English , and five while learning German . 
That will be swallowing a tongue very fast , or a hundred sous very slowly . '' 
In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand , a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties , had finally hunted up Marius ' abode . 
One morning , on his return from the law-school , Marius found a letter from his aunt , and the sixty pistoles , that is to say , six hundred francs in gold , in a sealed box . 
Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt , with a respectful letter , in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs . 
At that moment , he had three francs left . 
His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him . 
Besides , had he not said : `` Let me never hear the name of that blood-drinker again ! '' 
Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques , as he did not wish to run in debt there .
