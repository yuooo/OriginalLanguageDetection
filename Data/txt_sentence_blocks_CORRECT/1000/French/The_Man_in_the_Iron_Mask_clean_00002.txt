And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner . 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming , and addressing Moliere , said to him , in an undertone , `` You see before you , my dear monsieur , a man who considers himself disgraced , if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him ; study this type for me , Master Aristophanes , and profit by it . '' 
Moliere had no need of encouragement , and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` if you will come with me , I will make them take your measure without touching you . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos , `` how do you make that out , my friend ? '' 
`` I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your dress . 
It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of quality , who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them . 
We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these - '' `` Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin . 
Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , laughing , `` and do we write no more poems now , either ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
D'Artagnan , '' exclaimed Aramis , `` I have long ago given up all such tomfoolery . '' 
`` True , '' repeated D'Artagnan , only half convinced . 
As for Percerin , he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades . 
`` Do n't you perceive , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` that we are greatly boring this good gentleman , my dear D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
murmured the musketeer , aside ; `` that is , I am boring you , my friend . '' 
Then aloud , `` Well , then , let us leave ; I have no further business here , and if you are as disengaged as I , Aramis - '' `` No , not I - I wished - '' `` Ah ! 
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , - `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before . 
Percerin never moved . 
Aramis roused him violently , by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was engaged . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said he , `` I have , near hand , M. Lebrun , one of M. Fouquet 's painters . '' 
`` Ah , very good , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` but why Lebrun ? '' 
Aramis looked at D'Artagnan , who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark Antony . 
`` And you wish that I should make him a dress , similar to those of the Epicureans ? '' 
answered Percerin . 
And while saying this , in an absent manner , the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade . 
`` An Epicurean 's dress ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , in a tone of inquiry . 
`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . '' 
`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how - do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! '' 
`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the attentive musketeer ; perceiving with his wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now , and that the hour of battle was approaching . 
`` Let us see , '' said Percerin , incredulously . 
`` Why , now , '' continued Aramis , `` does M. Fouquet give the king a fete ? 
- Is it not to please him ? '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said Percerin . 
D'Artagnan nodded assent . 
`` By delicate attentions ? 
by some happy device ? 
by a succession of surprises , like that of which we were talking ? 
- the enrolment of our Epicureans . '' 
`` Admirable . '' 
`` Well , then ; this is the surprise we intend . 
M. Lebrun here is a man who draws most excellently . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Percerin ; `` I have seen his pictures , and observed that his dresses were highly elaborated . 
That is why I at once agreed to make him a costume - whether to agree with those of the Epicureans , or an original one . '' 
`` My dear monsieur , we accept your offer , and shall presently avail ourselves of it ; but just now , M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you will make for himself , but of those you are making for the king . '' 
Percerin made a bound backwards , which D'Artagnan - calmest and most appreciative of men , did not consider overdone , so many strange and startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded . 
`` The king 's dresses ! 
Give the king 's dresses to any mortal whatever ! 
Oh ! 
for once , monseigneur , your grace is mad ! '' 
cried the poor tailor in extremity . 
`` Help me now , D'Artagnan , '' said Aramis , more and more calm and smiling . 
`` Help me now to persuade monsieur , for you understand ; do you not ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! 
- not exactly , I declare . '' 
`` What ! 
you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux ; and that the portrait , which be a striking resemblance , ought to be dressed exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes , yes , '' said the musketeer , nearly convinced , so plausible was this reasoning . 
`` Yes , my dear Aramis , you are right ; it is a happy idea . 
I will wager it is one of your own , Aramis . '' 
`` Well , I do n't know , '' replied the bishop ; `` either mine or M. Fouquet 's . '' 
Then scanning Percerin , after noticing D'Artagnan 's hesitation , `` Well , Monsieur Percerin , '' he asked , `` what do you say to this ? '' 
`` I say , that - '' `` That you are , doubtless , free to refuse . 
I know well - and I by no means count upon compelling you , my dear monsieur . 
I will say more , I even understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet 's idea ; you dread appearing to flatter the king . 
A noble spirit , M. Percerin , a noble spirit ! '' 
The tailor stammered . 
`` It would , indeed , be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince , '' continued Aramis ; `` but as the surintendant told me , ` if Percerin refuse , tell him that it will not at all lower him in my opinion , and I shall always esteem him , only - ' '' '' ` Only ? ' '' 
repeated Percerin , rather troubled . '' 
` Only , ' '' continued Aramis , '' ' I shall be compelled to say to the king , ' -- you understand , my dear Monsieur Percerin , that these are M. Fouquet 's words , - ' I shall be constrained to say to the king , `` Sire , I had intended to present your majesty with your portrait , but owing to a feeling of delicacy , slightly exaggerated perhaps , although creditable , M. Percerin opposed the project . '' ' '' 
`` Opposed ! '' 
cried the tailor , terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him ; `` I to oppose the desire , the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to please the king ! 
Oh , what a hateful word you have uttered , monseigneur . 
Oppose ! 
Oh , 't is not I who said it , Heaven have mercy on me . 
I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it ! 
Is it not true , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that I have opposed nothing ? '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral . 
He felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it , whether comedy or tragedy ; he was at his wit 's end at not being able to fathom it , but in the meanwhile wished to keep clear . 
But already Percerin , goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he stood in the way of a pleasant surprise , had offered Lebrun a chair , and proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses , the fifth being still in the workmen 's hands ; and these masterpieces he successively fitted upon four lay figures , which , imported into France in the time of Concini , had been given to Percerin II . 
by Marshal d'Onore , after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their competition . 
The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses . 
But Aramis , who was closely watching all the phases of his toil , suddenly stopped him . 
`` I think you have not quite got it , my dear Lebrun , '' he said ; `` your colors will deceive you , and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance which is absolutely requisite . 
Time is necessary for attentively observing the finer shades . '' 
`` Quite true , '' said Percerin , `` but time is wanting , and on that head , you will agree with me , monseigneur , I can do nothing . '' 
`` Then the affair will fail , '' said Aramis , quietly , `` and that because of a want of precision in the colors . '' 
Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity - a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience . 
`` What in the world , now , is the meaning of this imbroglio ? '' 
the musketeer kept saying to himself . 
`` That will never do , '' said Aramis : `` M. Lebrun , close your box , and roll up your canvas . '' 
`` But , monsieur , '' cried the vexed painter , `` the light is abominable here . '' 
`` An idea , M. Lebrun , an idea ! 
If we had a pattern of the materials , for example , and with time , and a better light - '' `` Oh , then , '' cried Lebrun , `` I would answer for the effect . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing ; they want a pattern of each of the materials . 
Mordioux ! 
Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . '' 
Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes , Percerin put back the dresses into the closet , Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were secure , - and they all left the study . 
: Where , Probably , Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme . 
D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber ; but no longer an irritated Porthos , or a disappointed Porthos , but Porthos radiant , blooming , fascinating , and chattering with Moliere , who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry , and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater , but not even ever anything so great . 
Aramis went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand , which lost itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend , - an operation which Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness . 
But the friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him , the bishop of Vannes passed over to Moliere . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said he , `` will you come with me to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` I will go anywhere you like , monseigneur , '' answered Moliere . 
`` To Saint-Mande ! '' 
cried Porthos , surprised at seeing the proud bishop of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor . 
`` What , Aramis , are you going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically . 
`` Yes , I ask you , what has he done for you ? '' 
`` My friend , he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished : he has taken my measure without touching me ! '' 
`` Ah , bah ! 
tell me how he did it . '' 
`` First , then , they went , I do n't know where , for a number of lay figures , of all heights and sizes , hoping there would be one to suit mine , but the largest - that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard - was two inches too short , and a half foot too narrow in the chest . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` It is exactly as I tell you , D'Artagnan ; but he is a great man , or at the very least a great tailor , is this M. Moliere . 
He was not at all put at fault by the circumstance . '' 
`` What did he do , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is a very simple matter . 
I ` faith , 't is an unheard-of thing that people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method from the first . 
What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared me ! '' 
`` Not to mention of the costumes , my dear Porthos . '' 
`` Yes , thirty dresses . '' 
`` Well , my dear Porthos , come , tell me M. Moliere 's plan . '' 
`` Moliere ? 
You call him so , do you ? 
I shall make a point of recollecting his name . '' 
`` Yes ; or Poquelin , if you prefer that . '' 
`` No ; I like Moliere best . 
When I wish to recollect his name , I shall think of voliere -LSB- an aviary -RSB- ; and as I have one at Pierrefonds - '' `` Capital ! '' 
returned D'Artagnan . 
`` And M. Moliere 's plan ? '' '' 
'T is this : instead of pulling me to pieces , as all these rascals do - of making me bend my back , and double my joints - all of them low and dishonorable practices - '' D'Artagnan made a sign of approbation with his head . '' 
` Monsieur , ' he said to me , '' continued Porthos , '' ' a gentleman ought to measure himself . 
Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass ; ' and I drew near the glass . 
I must own I did not exactly understand what this good M. Voliere wanted with me . '' 
`` Moliere ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , Moliere - Moliere . 
And as the fear of being measured still possessed me , ` Take care , ' said I to him , ` what you are going to do with me ; I am very ticklish , I warn you . ' 
But he , with his soft voice -LRB- for he is a courteous fellow , we must admit , my friend -RRB- , he with his soft voice , ` Monsieur , ' said he , ` that your dress may fit you well , it must be made according to your figure . 
Your figure is exactly reflected in this mirror . 
We shall take the measure of this reflection . ' '' 
`` In fact , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you saw yourself in the glass ; but where did they find one in which you could see your whole figure ? '' 
`` My good friend , it is the very glass in which the king is used to look to see himself . '' 
`` Yes ; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are . '' 
`` Ah ! 
well , I know not how that may be ; it is , no doubt , a cunning way of flattering the king ; but the looking-glass was too large for me . 
'T is true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of glass , placed one above another , and its breadth of three similar parallelograms in juxtaposition . '' 
`` Oh , Porthos ! 
what excellent words you have command of . 
Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary ? '' 
`` At Belle-Isle . 
Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic studies and castramentative experiments . '' 
D'Artagnan recoiled , as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked the breath out of his body . 
`` Ah ! 
very good . 
Let us return to the looking-glass , my friend . '' 
`` Then , this good M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Yes - Moliere - you are right . 
You will see now , my dear friend , that I shall recollect his name quite well . 
This excellent M. Moliere set to work tracing out lines on the mirror , with a piece of Spanish chalk , following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders , all the while expounding this maxim , which I thought admirable : ` It is advisable that a dress should not incommode its wearer . ' '' 
`` In reality , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is an excellent maxim , which is , unfortunately , seldom carried out in practice . '' 
`` That is why I found it all the more astonishing , when he expatiated upon it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he expatiated ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
`` Let me hear his theory . '' '' 
` Seeing that , ' he continued , ` one may , in awkward circumstances , or in a troublesome position , have one 's doublet on one 's shoulder , and not desire to take one 's doublet off - ' '' `` True , '' said D'Artagnan . '' 
` And so , ' continued M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Moliere , yes . 
` And so , ' went on M. Moliere , ` you want to draw your sword , monsieur , and you have your doublet on your back . 
What do you do ? ' '' ' 
I take it off , ' I answered . '' 
` Well , no , ' he replied . '' 
` How no ? ' '' ' 
I say that the dress should be so well made , that it will in no way encumber you , even in drawing your sword . ' '' 
` Ah , ah ! ' '' 
` Throw yourself on guard , ' pursued he . 
`` I did it with such wondrous firmness , that two panes of glass burst out of the window . '' '' 
Tis nothing , nothing , ' said he . 
` Keep your position . ' 
`` I raised my left arm in the air , the forearm gracefully bent , the ruffle drooping , and my wrist curved , while my right arm , half extended , securely covered my wrist with the elbow , and my breast with the wrist . '' 
`` Yes , '' said D'Artagnan , '' 't is the true guard - the academic guard . '' 
`` You have said the very word , dear friend . 
In the meanwhile , Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Hold ! 
I should certainly , after all , prefer to call him - what did you say his other name was ? '' 
`` Poquelin . '' 
`` I prefer to call him Poquelin . '' 
`` And how will you remember this name better than the other ? '' 
`` You understand , he calls himself Poquelin , does he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard . '' 
`` Good . '' 
`` And change Coc into Poc , nard into lin ; and instead of Coquenard I shall have Poquelin . '' '' 
'T is wonderful , '' cried D'Artagnan , astounded . 
`` Go on , my friend , I am listening to you with admiration . '' 
`` This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass . '' 
`` I beg your pardon - Poquelin . '' 
`` What did I say , then ? '' 
`` You said Coquelin . '' 
`` Ah ! 
true . 
This Poquelin , then , sketched my arm on the glass ; but he took his time over it ; he kept looking at me a good deal . 
The fact is , that I must have been looking particularly handsome . '' '' 
` Does it weary you ? ' 
he asked . '' ' 
A little , ' I replied , bending a little in my hands , ` but I could hold out for an hour or so longer . ' '' 
` No , no , I will not allow it ; the willing fellows will make it a duty to support your arms , as of old , men supported those of the prophet . ' '' 
` Very good , ' I answered . '' 
` That will not be humiliating to you ? ' '' 
` My friend , ' said I , ` there is , I think , a great difference between being supported and being measured . ' '' 
`` The distinction is full of the soundest sense , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Then , '' continued Porthos , `` he made a sign : two lads approached ; one supported my left arm , while the other , with infinite address , supported my right . '' '' 
` Another , my man , ' cried he . 
A third approached . 
` Support monsieur by the waist , ' said he . 
The garcon complied . '' 
`` So that you were at rest ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Perfectly ; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass . '' 
`` Poquelin , my friend . '' 
`` Poquelin - you are right . 
Stay , decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere . '' 
`` Yes ; and then it was over , was n't it ? '' 
`` During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror . '' '' 
'T was delicate in him . '' 
`` I much like the plan ; it is respectful , and keeps every one in his place . '' 
`` And there it ended ? '' 
`` Without a soul having touched me , my friend . '' 
`` Except the three garcons who supported you . '' 
`` Doubtless ; but I have , I think , already explained to you the difference there is between supporting and measuring . '' '' 
'T is true , '' answered D'Artagnan ; who said afterwards to himself , `` I ` faith , I greatly deceive myself , or I have been the means of a good windfall to that rascal Moliere , and we shall assuredly see the scene hit off to the life in some comedy or other . '' 
Porthos smiled . 
`` What are you laughing at ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Must I confess ? 
Well , I was laughing over my good fortune . '' 
`` Oh , that is true ; I do n't know a happier man than you . 
But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you ? ' 
`` Well , my dear fellow , congratulate me . '' 
`` I desire nothing better . '' 
`` It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that manner . '' 
`` Are you so sure of it ? ' 
`` Nearly so . 
Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere and the other garcons showed me the fact . '' 
`` Well , my friend , that does not surprise me from Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . '' 
`` Wo n't it be of use to him , indeed ? 
I believe you , it will , and that in the highest degree ; - for you see my friend Moliere is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons , comtes , and marquises - according to their measure . '' 
On this observation , neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss , D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin 's house and rejoined their carriages , wherein we will leave them , in order to look after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande . 
: The Bee-Hive , the Bees , and the Honey . 
The bishop of Vannes , much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin 's , returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor . 
Moliere , on the other hand , quite delighted at having made such a capital rough sketch , and at knowing where to find his original again , whenever he should desire to convert his sketch into a picture , Moliere arrived in the merriest of moods . 
All the first story of the left wing was occupied by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris , and those on the freest footing in the house - every one in his compartment , like the bees in their cells , employed in producing the honey intended for that royal cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV . 
during the fete at Vaux . 
Pelisson , his head leaning on his hand , was engaged in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the `` Facheux , '' a comedy in three acts , which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere , as D'Artagnan called him , or Coquelin de Voliere , as Porthos styled him . 
Loret , with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer , - the gazetteers of all ages have always been so artless ! 
- Loret was composing an account of the fetes at Vaux , before those fetes had taken place . 
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other , a peripatetic , absent - minded , boring , unbearable dreamer , who kept buzzing and humming at everybody 's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions . 
He so often disturbed Pelisson , that the latter , raising his head , crossly said , `` At least , La Fontaine , supply me with a rhyme , since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus . '' 
`` What rhyme do you want ? '' 
asked the Fabler as Madame de Sevigne used to call him . 
`` I want a rhyme to lumiere . '' 
`` Orniere , '' answered La Fontaine . 
`` Ah , but , my good friend , one can not talk of wheel-ruts when celebrating the delights of Vaux , '' said Loret . 
`` Besides , it does n't rhyme , '' answered Pelisson . 
`` What ! 
does n't rhyme ! '' 
cried La Fontaine , in surprise . 
`` Yes ; you have an abominable habit , my friend , - a habit which will ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order . 
You rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , oh , you think so , do you , Pelisson ? '' 
`` Yes , I do , indeed . 
Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can find a better . '' 
`` Then I will never write anything again save in prose , '' said La Fontaine , who had taken up Pelisson 's reproach in earnest . 
`` Ah ! 
I often suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet ! 
Yes , 't is the very truth . '' 
`` Do not say so ; your remark is too sweeping , and there is much that is good in your ` Fables . ' '' 
`` And to begin , '' continued La Fontaine , following up his idea , `` I will go and burn a hundred verses I have just made . '' 
`` Where are your verses ? '' 
`` In my head . '' 
`` Well , if they are in your head you can not burn them . '' 
`` True , '' said La Fontaine ; `` but if I do not burn them - '' `` Well , what will happen if you do not burn them ? '' 
`` They will remain in my mind , and I shall never forget them ! '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
cried Loret ; `` what a dangerous thing ! 
One would go mad with it ! '' 
`` The deuce ! 
the deuce ! '' 
repeated La Fontaine ; `` what can I do ? '' 
`` I have discovered the way , '' said Moliere , who had entered just at this point of the conversation . 
`` What way ? '' 
`` Write them first and burn them afterwards . '' 
`` How simple ! 
Well , I should never have discovered that . 
What a mind that devil of a Moliere has ! '' 
said La Fontaine . 
Then , striking his forehead , `` Oh , thou wilt never be aught but an ass , Jean La Fontaine ! '' 
he added . 
`` What are you saying there , my friend ? '' 
broke in Moliere , approaching the poet , whose aside he had heard . 
`` I say I shall never be aught but an ass , '' answered La Fontaine , with a heavy sigh and swimming eyes . 
`` Yes , my friend , '' he added , with increasing grief , `` it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , 't is wrong to say so . '' 
`` Nay , I am a poor creature ! '' 
`` Who said so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
't was Pelisson ; did you not , Pelisson ? '' 
Pelisson , again absorbed in his work , took good care not to answer . 
`` But if Pelisson said you were so , '' cried Moliere , `` Pelisson has seriously offended you . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I advise you , as you are a gentleman , not to leave an insult like that unpunished . '' 
`` What ! '' 
exclaimed La Fontaine . 
`` Did you ever fight ? '' 
`` Once only , with a lieutenant in the light horse . '' 
`` What wrong had he done you ? '' 
`` It seems he ran away with my wife . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Moliere , becoming slightly pale ; but as , at La Fontaine 's declaration , the others had turned round , Moliere kept upon his lips the rallying smile which had so nearly died away , and continuing to make La Fontaine speak - `` And what was the result of the duel ? '' 
`` The result was , that on the ground my opponent disarmed me , and then made an apology , promising never again to set foot in my house . '' 
`` And you considered yourself satisfied ? '' 
said Moliere . 
`` Not at all ! 
on the contrary , I picked up my sword . ' 
I beg your pardon , monsieur , ' I said , ' I have not fought you because you were my wife 's friend , but because I was told I ought to fight . 
So , as I have never known any peace save since you made her acquaintance , do me the pleasure to continue your visits as heretofore , or morbleu ! 
let us set to again . ' 
And so , '' continued La Fontaine , `` he was compelled to resume his friendship with madame , and I continue to be the happiest of husbands . '' 
All burst out laughing . 
Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes . 
Why ? 
Perhaps to wipe away a tear , perhaps to smother a sigh . 
Alas ! 
we know that Moliere was a moralist , but he was not a philosopher . '' 
'T is all one , '' he said , returning to the topic of the conversation , `` Pelisson has insulted you . '' 
`` Ah , truly ! 
I had already forgotten it . '' 
`` And I am going to challenge him on your behalf . '' 
`` Well , you can do so , if you think it indispensable . '' 
`` I do think it indispensable , and I am going to - '' `` Stay , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` I want your advice . '' 
`` Upon what ? 
this insult ? '' 
`` No ; tell me really now whether lumiere does not rhyme with orniere . '' 
`` I should make them rhyme . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I knew you would . '' 
`` And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time . '' 
`` A hundred thousand ! '' 
cried La Fontaine . 
`` Four times as many as ` La Pucelle , ' which M. Chaplain is meditating . 
Is it also on this subject , too , that you have composed a hundred thousand verses ? '' 
`` Listen to me , you eternally absent-minded creature , '' said Moliere . 
`` It is certain , '' continued La Fontaine , `` that legume , for instance , rhymes with posthume . '' 
`` In the plural , above all . '' 
`` Yes , above all in the plural , seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters , but with four ; as orniere does with lumiere . '' 
`` But give me ornieres and lumieres in the plural , my dear Pelisson , '' said La Fontaine , clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend , whose insult he had quite forgotten , `` and they will rhyme . '' 
`` Hem ! '' 
coughed Pelisson . 
`` Moliere says so , and Moliere is a judge of such things ; he declares he has himself made a hundred thousand verses . '' 
`` Come , '' said Moliere , laughing , `` he is off now . '' 
`` It is like rivage , which rhymes admirably with herbage . 
I would take my oath of it . '' 
`` But - '' said Moliere . 
`` I tell you all this , '' continued La Fontaine , `` because you are preparing a divertissement for Vaux , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , the ` Facheux . ' '' 
`` Ah , yes , the ` Facheux ; ' yes , I recollect . 
Well , I was thinking a prologue would admirably suit your divertissement . '' 
`` Doubtless it would suit capitally . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are of my opinion ? '' 
`` So much so , that I have asked you to write this very prologue . '' 
`` You asked me to write it ? '' 
`` Yes , you , and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson , who is engaged upon it at this moment . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is what Pelisson is doing , then ? 
I ` faith , my dear Moliere , you are indeed often right . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` When you call me absent-minded . 
It is a monstrous defect ; I will cure myself of it , and do your prologue for you . '' 
`` But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it ! 
- '' `` Ah , true , miserable rascal that I am ! 
Loret was indeed right in saying I was a poor creature . '' 
`` It was not Loret who said so , my friend . '' 
`` Well , then , whoever said so , 't is the same to me ! 
And so your divertissement is called the ` Facheux ? ' 
Well , can you make heureux rhyme with facheux ? '' 
`` If obliged , yes . '' 
`` And even with capriceux . '' 
`` Oh , no , no . '' 
`` It would be hazardous , and yet why so ? '' 
`` There is too great a difference in the cadences . '' 
`` I was fancying , '' said La Fontaine , leaving Moliere for Loret - `` I was fancying - '' `` What were you fancying ? '' 
said Loret , in the middle of a sentence . 
`` Make haste . '' 
`` You are writing the prologue to the ` Facheux , ' are you not ? '' 
`` No ! 
mordieu ! 
it is Pelisson . '' 
`` Ah , Pelisson , '' cried La Fontaine , going over to him , `` I was fancying , '' he continued , `` that the nymph of Vaux - '' `` Ah , beautiful ! '' 
cried Loret . 
`` The nymph of Vaux ! 
thank you , La Fontaine ; you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper . '' 
`` Well , if you can rhyme so well , La Fontaine , '' said Pelisson , `` tell me now in what way you would begin my prologue ? '' 
`` I should say , for instance , ` Oh ! 
nymph , who - ' After ` who ' I should place a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative ; and should go on thus : ` this grot profound . ' '' 
`` But the verb , the verb ? '' 
asked Pelisson . 
`` To admire the greatest king of all kings round , '' continued La Fontaine . 
`` But the verb , the verb , '' obstinately insisted Pelisson . 
`` This second person singular of the present indicative ? '' 
`` Well , then ; quittest : `` Oh , nymph , who quittest now this grot profound , To admire the greatest king of all kings round . '' 
`` You would not put ` who quittest , ' would you ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' '' 
` Quittest , ' after ` you who ' ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear fellow , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` you are a shocking pedant ! '' 
`` Without counting , '' said Moliere , `` that the second verse , ` king of all kings round , ' is very weak , my dear La Fontaine . '' 
`` Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature , - a shuffler , as you said . '' 
`` I never said so . '' 
`` Then , as Loret said . '' 
`` And it was not Loret either ; it was Pelisson . '' 
`` Well , Pelisson was right a hundred times over . 
But what annoys me more than anything , my dear Moliere , is , that I fear we shall not have our Epicurean dresses . '' 
`` You expected yours , then , for the fete ? '' 
`` Yes , for the fete , and then for after the fete . 
My housekeeper told me that my own is rather faded . '' 
`` Diable ! 
your housekeeper is right ; rather more than faded . '' 
`` Ah , you see , '' resumed La Fontaine , `` the fact is , I left it on the floor in my room , and my cat - '' `` Well , your cat - '' `` She made her nest upon it , which has rather changed its color . '' 
Moliere burst out laughing ; Pelisson and Loret followed his example . 
At this juncture , the bishop of Vannes appeared , with a roll of plans and parchments under his arm . 
As if the angel of death had chilled all gay and sprightly fancies - as if that wan form had scared away the Graces to whom Xenocrates sacrificed - silence immediately reigned through the study , and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen . 
Aramis distributed the notes of invitation , and thanked them in the name of M. Fouquet . 
`` The superintendent , '' he said , `` being kept to his room by business , could not come and see them , but begged them to send him some of the fruits of their day 's work , to enable him to forget the fatigue of his labor in the night . '' 
At these words , all settled down to work . 
La Fontaine placed himself at a table , and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white vellum ; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue ; Moliere contributed fifty fresh verses , with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him ; Loret , an article on the marvelous fetes he predicted ; and Aramis , laden with his booty like the king of the bees , that great black drone , decked with purple and gold , re-entered his apartment , silent and busy . 
But before departing , `` Remember , gentlemen , '' said he , `` we leave to-morrow evening . '' 
`` In that case , I must give notice at home , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes ; poor Moliere ! '' 
said Loret , smiling ; `` he loves his home . '' '' 
` He loves , ' yes , '' replied Moliere , with his sad , sweet smile . '' 
` He loves , ' that does not mean , they love him . '' 
`` As for me , '' said La Fontaine , `` they love me at Chateau Thierry , I am very sure . '' 
Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance . 
`` Will any one go with me ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I am going by Paris , after having passed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet . 
I offer my carriage . '' 
`` Good , '' said Moliere , `` I accept it . 
I am in a hurry . '' 
`` I shall dine here , '' said Loret . 
`` M. de Gourville has promised me some craw-fish . '' 
`` He has promised me some whitings . 
Find a rhyme for that , La Fontaine . '' 
Aramis went out laughing , as only he could laugh , and Moliere followed him . 
They were at the bottom of the stairs , when La Fontaine opened the door , and shouted out : `` He has promised us some whitings , In return for these our writings . '' 
The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis opened the door of the study . 
As to Moliere , he had undertaken to order the horses , while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the superintendent . 
`` Oh , how they are laughing there ! '' 
said Fouquet , with a sigh . 
`` Do you not laugh , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I laugh no longer now , M. d'Herblay . 
The fete is approaching ; money is departing . '' 
`` Have I not told you that was my business ? '' 
`` Yes , you promised me millions . '' 
`` You shall have them the day after the king 's entree into Vaux . '' 
Fouquet looked closely at Aramis , and passed the back of his icy hand across his moistened brow . 
Aramis perceived that the superintendent either doubted him , or felt he was powerless to obtain the money . 
How could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop , ex-abbe , ex-musketeer , could find any ? 
`` Why doubt me ? '' 
said Aramis . 
Fouquet smiled and shook his head . 
`` Man of little faith ! '' 
added the bishop . 
`` My dear M. d'Herblay , '' answered Fouquet , `` if I fall - '' `` Well ; if you ` fall ' ? '' 
`` I shall , at least , fall from such a height , that I shall shatter myself in falling . '' 
Then giving himself a shake , as though to escape from himself , `` Whence came you , '' said he , `` my friend ? '' 
`` From Paris - from Percerin . '' 
`` And what have you been doing at Percerin 's , for I suppose you attach no great importance to our poets ' dresses ? '' 
`` No ; I went to prepare a surprise . '' 
`` Surprise ? '' 
`` Yes ; which you are going to give to the king . '' 
`` And will it cost much ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun . '' 
`` A painting ? 
- Ah ! 
all the better ! 
And what is this painting to represent ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; then at the same time , whatever you may say or think of it , I went to see the dresses for our poets . '' 
`` Bah ! 
and they will be rich and elegant ? '' 
`` Splendid ! 
There will be few great monseigneurs with so good . 
People will see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and those of friendship . '' 
`` Ever generous and grateful , dear prelate . '' 
`` In your school . '' 
Fouquet grasped his hand . 
`` And where are you going ? '' 
he said . 
`` I am off to Paris , when you shall have given a certain letter . '' 
`` For whom ? '' 
`` M. de Lyonne . '' 
`` And what do you want with Lyonne ? '' 
`` I wish to make him sign a lettre de cachet . '' '' 
` Lettre de cachet ! ' 
Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile ? '' 
`` On the contrary - to let somebody out . '' 
`` And who ? '' 
`` A poor devil - a youth , a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years , for two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits . '' '' 
` Two Latin verses ! ' 
and , for ` two Latin verses , ' the miserable being has been in prison for ten years ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` And has committed no other crime ? '' 
`` Beyond this , he is as innocent as you or I. '' `` On your word ? '' 
`` On my honor ! '' 
`` And his name is - '' `` Seldon . '' 
`` Yes . 
- But it is too bad . 
You knew this , and you never told me ! '' '' 
'T was only yesterday his mother applied to me , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the woman is poor ! '' 
`` In the deepest misery . '' 
`` Heaven , '' said Fouquet , `` sometimes bears with such injustice on earth , that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence . 
Stay , M. d'Herblay . '' 
And Fouquet , taking a pen , wrote a few rapid lines to his colleague Lyonne . 
Aramis took the letter and made ready to go . 
`` Wait , '' said Fouquet . 
He opened his drawer , and took out ten government notes which were there , each for a thousand francs . 
`` Stay , '' he said ; `` set the son at liberty , and give this to the mother ; but , above all , do not tell her - '' `` What , monseigneur ? '' 
`` That she is ten thousand livres richer than I . 
She would say I am but a poor superintendent ! 
Go ! 
and I pray that God will bless those who are mindful of his poor ! '' 
`` So also do I pray , '' replied Aramis , kissing Fouquet 's hand . 
And he went out quickly , carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes for Seldon 's mother , and taking up Moliere , who was beginning to lose patience . 
: Another Supper at the Bastile . 
Seven o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile , that famous clock , which , like all the accessories of the state prison , the very use of which is a torture , recalled to the prisoners ' minds the destination of every hour of their punishment . 
The time-piece of the Bastile , adorned with figures , like most of the clocks of the period , represented St. Peter in bonds . 
It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives . 
The doors , grating on their enormous hinges , opened for the passage of the baskets and trays of provisions , the abundance and the delicacy of which , as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us , was regulated by the condition in life of the prisoner . 
We understand on this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux , sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies , head cook of the royal fortress , whose trays , full-laden , were ascending the steep staircases , carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages . 
This same hour was that of M. le gouverneur 's supper also . 
He had a guest to - day , and the spit turned more heavily than usual . 
Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation . 
As for M. de Baisemeaux , with the facility of vulgar people , he gave himself up entirely upon this point of his guest 's freedom . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur . '' 
`` By no means , '' said Aramis ; `` call me monsieur ; I am booted . '' 
`` Do you know , monsieur , of whom you remind me this evening ? '' 
`` No ! 
faith , '' said Aramis , taking up his glass ; `` but I hope I remind you of a capital guest . '' 
`` You remind me of two , monsieur . 
Francois , shut the window ; the wind may annoy his greatness . '' 
`` And let him go , '' added Aramis . 
`` The supper is completely served , and we shall eat it very well without waiters . 
I like exceedingly to be tete-a - tete when I am with a friend . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed respectfully . 
`` I like exceedingly , '' continued Aramis , `` to help myself . '' 
`` Retire , Francois , '' cried Baisemeaux . 
`` I was saying that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons ; one very illustrious , the late cardinal , the great Cardinal de la Rochelle , who wore boots like you . '' 
`` Indeed , '' said Aramis ; `` and the other ? '' 
`` The other was a certain musketeer , very handsome , very brave , very adventurous , very fortunate , who , from being abbe , turned musketeer , and from musketeer turned abbe . '' 
Aramis condescended to smile . 
`` From abbe , '' continued Baisemeaux , encouraged by Aramis 's smile - `` from abbe , bishop - and from bishop - '' `` Ah ! 
stay there , I beg , '' exclaimed Aramis . 
`` I have just said , monsieur , that you gave me the idea of a cardinal . '' 
`` Enough , dear M. Baisemeaux . 
As you said , I have on the boots of a cavalier , but I do not intend , for all that , to embroil myself with the church this evening . '' 
`` But you have wicked intentions , nevertheless , monseigneur . '' 
`` Oh , yes , wicked , I own , as everything mundane is . '' 
`` You traverse the town and the streets in disguise ? '' 
`` In disguise , as you say . '' 
`` And you still make use of your sword ? '' 
`` Yes , I should think so ; but only when I am compelled . 
Do me the pleasure to summon Francois . '' 
`` Have you no wine there ? '' '' 
'T is not for wine , but because it is hot here , and the window is shut . '' 
`` I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the arrival of couriers . '' 
`` Ah , yes . 
You hear them when the window is open ? '' 
`` But too well , and that disturbs me . 
You understand ? '' 
`` Nevertheless I am suffocated . 
Francois . '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Open the windows , I pray you , Master Francois , '' said Aramis . 
`` You will allow him , dear M. Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` You are at home here , '' answered the governor . 
The window was opened . 
`` Do you not think , '' said M. de Baisemeaux , `` that you will find yourself very lonely , now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at Blois ? 
He is a very old friend , is he not ? '' 
`` You know it as I do , Baisemeaux , seeing that you were in the musketeers with us . '' 
`` Bah ! 
with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years . '' 
`` And you are right . 
But I do more than love M. de la Fere , dear Baisemeaux ; I venerate him . '' 
`` Well , for my part , though 't is singular , '' said the governor , `` I prefer M. d'Artagnan to him . 
There is a man for you , who drinks long and well ! 
That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts . '' 
`` Baisemeaux , make me tipsy to-night ; let us have a merry time of it as of old , and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart , I promise you , you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your glass . '' 
`` Bravo ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , and he poured out a great glass of wine and drank it off at a draught , trembling with joy at the idea of being , by hook or by crook , in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor . 
While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was noting the sounds in the great court . 
A courier came in about eight o'clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle , and , although the courier made a great noise , Baisemeaux heard nothing . 
`` The devil take him , '' said Aramis . 
`` What ! 
who ? '' 
asked Baisemeaux . 
`` I hope 't is neither the wine you drank nor he who is the cause of your drinking it . '' 
`` No ; it is a horse , who is making noise enough in the court for a whole squadron . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
some courier or other , '' replied the governor , redoubling his attention to the passing bottle . 
`` Yes ; and may the devil take him , and so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more . 
Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
`` You forget me , Baisemeaux ! 
my glass is empty , '' said Aramis , lifting his dazzling Venetian goblet . 
`` Upon my honor , you delight me . 
Francois , wine ! '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Wine , fellow ! 
and better . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , yes ; but a courier has just arrived . '' 
`` Let him go to the devil , I say . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , but - '' `` Let him leave his news at the office ; we will see to it to-morrow . 
To - morrow , there will be time to-morrow ; there will be daylight , '' said Baisemeaux , chanting the words . 
`` Ah , monsieur , '' grumbled the soldier Francois , in spite of himself , `` monsieur . '' 
`` Take care , '' said Aramis , `` take care ! '' 
`` Of what ? 
dear M. d'Herblay , '' said Baisemeaux , half intoxicated . 
`` The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is sometimes an order . '' 
`` Nearly always . '' 
`` Do not orders issue from the ministers ? '' 
`` Yes , undoubtedly ; but - '' `` And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the king ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . 
Nevertheless , 't is very tiresome when you are sitting before a good table , tete-a-tete with a friend - Ah ! 
I beg your pardon , monsieur ; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper , and that I speak to a future cardinal . '' 
`` Let us pass over that , dear Baisemeaux , and return to our soldier , to Francois . '' 
`` Well , and what has Francois done ? '' 
`` He has demurred ! '' 
`` He was wrong , then ? '' 
`` However , he has demurred , you see ; 't is because there is something extraordinary in this matter . 
It is very possible that it was not Francois who was wrong in demurring , but you , who are in the wrong in not listening to him . '' 
`` Wrong ? 
I to be wrong before Francois ? 
that seems rather hard . '' 
`` Pardon me , merely an irregularity . 
But I thought it my duty to make an observation which I deem important . '' 
`` Oh ! 
perhaps you are right , '' stammered Baisemeaux . 
`` The king 's order is sacred ; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper , I repeat that the devil - '' `` If you had said as much to the great cardinal - hem ! 
my dear Baisemeaux , and if his order had any importance . '' 
`` I do it that I may not disturb a bishop . 
Mordioux ! 
am I not , then , excusable ? '' 
`` Do not forget , Baisemeaux , that I have worn the soldier 's coat , and I am accustomed to obedience everywhere . '' 
`` You wish , then - '' `` I wish that you would do your duty , my friend ; yes , at least before this soldier . '' '' 
'T is mathematically true , '' exclaimed Baisemeaux . 
Francois still waited : `` Let them send this order of the king 's up to me , '' he repeated , recovering himself . 
And he added in a low tone , `` Do you know what it is ? 
I will tell you something about as interesting as this . 
` Beware of fire near the powder magazine ; ' or , ` Look close after such and such a one , who is clever at escaping , ' Ah ! 
if you only knew , monseigneur , how many times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest , deepest slumber , by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me , or rather , bring me a slip of paper containing these words : ` Monsieur de Baisemeaux , what news ? ' 
'T is clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile . 
They would know better ; they have never considered the thickness of my walls , the vigilance of my officers , the number of rounds we go . 
But , indeed , what can you expect , monseigneur ? 
It is their business to write and torment me when I am at rest , and to trouble me when I am happy , '' added Baisemeaux , bowing to Aramis . 
`` Then let them do their business . '' 
`` And do you do yours , '' added the bishop , smiling . 
Francois re-entered ; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister 's order . 
He slowly undid it , and as slowly read it . 
Aramis pretended to be drinking , so as to be able to watch his host through the glass . 
Then , Baisemeaux , having read it : `` What was I just saying ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the bishop . 
`` An order of release ! 
There , now ; excellent news indeed to disturb us ! '' 
`` Excellent news for him whom it concerns , you will at least agree , my dear governor ! '' 
`` And at eight o'clock in the evening ! '' 
`` It is charitable ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
charity is all very well , but it is for that fellow who says he is so weary and tired , but not for me who am amusing myself , '' said Baisemeaux , exasperated . 
`` Will you lose by him , then ? 
And is the prisoner who is to be set at liberty a good payer ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , indeed ! 
a miserable , five-franc rat ! '' 
`` Let me see it , '' asked M. d'Herblay . 
`` It is no indiscretion ? '' 
`` By no means ; read it . '' 
`` There is ` Urgent , ' on the paper ; you have seen that , I suppose ? '' 
`` Oh , admirable ! 
` Urgent ! ' 
- a man who has been there ten years ! 
It is urgent to set him free to-day , this very evening , at eight o'clock ! 
- urgent ! '' 
And Baisemeaux , shrugging his shoulders with an air of supreme disdain , flung the order on the table and began eating again . 
`` They are fond of these tricks ! '' 
he said , with his mouth full ; `` they seize a man , some fine day , keep him under lock and key for ten years , and write to you , ` Watch this fellow well , ' or ` Keep him very strictly . ' 
And then , as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a dangerous man , all of a sudden , without rhyme or reason they write - ` Set him at liberty , ' and actually add to their missive - ` urgent . ' 
You will own , my lord , 't is enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders ! '' 
`` What do you expect ? 
It is for them to write , '' said Aramis , `` for you to execute the order . '' 
`` Good ! 
good ! 
execute it ! 
Oh , patience ! 
You must not imagine that I am a slave . '' 
`` Gracious Heaven ! 
my very good M. Baisemeaux , who ever said so ? 
Your independence is well known . '' 
`` Thank Heaven ! '' 
`` But your goodness of heart is also known . '' 
`` Ah ! 
do n't speak of it ! '' 
`` And your obedience to your superiors . 
Once a soldier , you see , Baisemeaux , always a soldier . '' 
`` And I shall directly obey ; and to-morrow morning , at daybreak , the prisoner referred to shall be set free . '' 
`` To-morrow ? '' 
`` At dawn . '' 
`` Why not this evening , seeing that the lettre de cachet bears , both on the direction and inside , ` urgent ' ? '' 
`` Because this evening we are at supper , and our affairs are urgent , too ! '' 
`` Dear Baisemeaux , booted though I be , I feel myself a priest , and charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst . 
This unfortunate man has suffered long enough , since you have just told me that he has been your prisoner these ten years . 
Abridge his suffering . 
His good time has come ; give him the benefit quickly . 
God will repay you in Paradise with years of felicity . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` I entreat you . '' 
`` What ! 
in the very middle of our repast ? '' 
`` I implore you ; such an action is worth ten Benedicites . '' 
`` It shall be as you desire , only our supper will get cold . '' 
`` Oh ! 
never heed that . '' 
Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois , and by a very natural motion turned round towards the door . 
The order had remained on the table ; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to change the paper for another , folded in the same manner , which he drew swiftly from his pocket . 
`` Francois , '' said the governor , `` let the major come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere . '' 
Francois bowed and quitted the room , leaving the two companions alone . 
: The General of the Order . 
There was now a brief silence , during which Aramis never removed his eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment . 
The latter seemed only half decided to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper , and it was clear he was trying to invent some pretext , whether good or bad , for delay , at any rate till after dessert . 
And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at last . 
`` Eh ! 
but it is impossible ! '' 
he cried . 
`` How impossible ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Give me a glimpse of this impossibility . '' '' 
'T is impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour . 
Where can he go to , a man so unacquainted with Paris ? '' 
`` He will find a place wherever he can . '' 
`` You see , now , one might as well set a blind man free ! '' 
`` I have a carriage , and will take him wherever he wishes . '' 
`` You have an answer for everything . 
Francois , tell monsieur le major to go and open the cell of M. Seldon , No. 3 , Bertaudiere . '' 
`` Seldon ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis , very naturally . 
`` You said Seldon , I think ? '' 
`` I said Seldon , of course . 
'T is the name of the man they set free . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you mean to say Marchiali ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Marchiali ? 
oh ! 
yes , indeed . 
No , no , Seldon . '' 
`` I think you are making a mistake , Monsieur Baisemeaux . '' 
`` I have read the order . '' 
`` And I also . '' 
`` And I saw ` Seldon ' in letters as large as that , '' and Baisemeaux held up his finger . 
`` And I read ` Marchiali ' in characters as large as this , '' said Aramis , also holding up two fingers . 
`` To the proof ; let us throw a light on the matter , '' said Baisemeaux , confident he was right . 
`` There is the paper , you have only to read it . '' 
`` I read ` Marchiali , ' '' returned Aramis , spreading out the paper . 
`` Look . '' 
Baisemeaux looked , and his arms dropped suddenly . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he said , quite overwhelmed ; `` yes , Marchiali . 
'T is plainly written Marchiali ! 
Quite true ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
- '' `` How ? 
the man of whom we have talked so much ? 
The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of ? '' 
`` There is ` Marchiali , ' '' repeated the inflexible Aramis . 
`` I must own it , monseigneur . 
But I understand nothing about it . '' 
`` You believe your eyes , at any rate . '' 
`` To tell me very plainly there is ` Marchiali . ' '' 
`` And in a good handwriting , too . '' '' 
'T is a wonder ! 
I still see this order and the name of Seldon , Irishman . 
I see it . 
Ah ! 
I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of ink . '' 
`` No , there is no ink ; no , there is no blot . '' 
`` Oh ! 
but there was , though ; I know it , because I rubbed my finger - this very one - in the powder that was over the blot . '' 
`` In a word , be it how it may , dear M. Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , `` and whatever you may have seen , the order is signed to release Marchiali , blot or no blot . '' 
`` The order is signed to release Marchiali , '' replied Baisemeaux , mechanically , endeavoring to regain his courage . 
`` And you are going to release this prisoner . 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also , I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in the world . '' 
Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile , the irony of which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux 's confusion of mind , and restored his courage . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he said , `` this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a priest confessor of our order came to visit in so imperious and so secret a manner . '' 
`` I do n't know that , monsieur , '' replied the bishop . '' 
'T is no such long time ago , dear Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` It is true . 
But with us , monsieur , it is good that the man of to-day should no longer know what the man of yesterday did . '' 
`` In any case , '' said Baisemeaux , `` the visit of the Jesuit confessor must have given happiness to this man . '' 
Aramis made no reply , but recommenced eating and drinking . 
As for Baisemeaux , no longer touching anything that was on the table , he again took up the order and examined it every way . 
This investigation , under ordinary circumstances , would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis burn with anger ; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so little , above all , when he had murmured to himself that to do so was dangerous . 
`` Are you going to release Marchiali ? '' 
he said . 
`` What mellow , fragrant and delicious sherry this is , my dear governor . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Baisemeaux , `` I shall release the prisoner Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order , and above all , when , by interrogating him , I have satisfied myself . '' 
`` The order is sealed , and the courier is ignorant of the contents . 
What do you want to satisfy yourself about ? '' 
`` Be it so , monseigneur ; but I shall send to the ministry , and M. de Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order . '' 
`` What is the good of all that ? '' 
asked Aramis , coldly . 
`` What good ? '' 
`` Yes ; what is your object , I ask ? '' 
`` The object of never deceiving oneself , monseigneur ; nor being wanting in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers , nor infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one 's own free will . '' 
`` Very good ; you have just spoken so eloquently , that I can not but admire you . 
It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors ; he is guilty when he deceives himself , and he should be punished if he infringed either the duties or laws of his office . '' 
Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment . 
`` It follows , '' pursued Aramis , `` that you are going to ask advice , to put your conscience at ease in the matter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And if a superior officer gives you orders , you will obey ? '' 
`` Never doubt it , monseigneur . '' 
`` You know the king 's signature well , M. de Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Is it not on this order of release ? '' 
`` It is true , but it may - '' `` Be forged , you mean ? '' 
`` That is evident , monseigneur . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` I see it plain enough on the order ; but for the same reason that the king 's signature may have been forged , so also , and with even greater probability , may M. de Lyonne 's . '' 
`` Your logic has the stride of a giant , M. de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and your reasoning is irresistible . 
But on what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are false ? '' 
`` On this : the absence of counter-signatures . 
Nothing checks his majesty 's signature ; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has signed . '' 
`` Well , Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , bending an eagle glance on the governor , `` I adopt so frankly your doubts , and your mode of clearing them up , that I will take a pen , if you will give me one . '' 
Baisemeaux gave him a pen . 
`` And a sheet of white paper , '' added Aramis . 
Baisemeaux handed him some paper . 
`` Now , I - I , also - I , here present - incontestably , I - am going to write an order to which I am certain you will give credence , incredulous as you are ! '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner . 
It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop 's , but just now so playful and gay , had become funereal and sad ; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel , the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood . 
Aramis took a pen and wrote . 
Baisemeaux , in terror , read over his shoulder . 
`` A. M. D. G. , '' wrote the bishop ; and he drew a cross under these four letters , which signify ad majorem Dei gloriam , `` to the greater glory of God ; '' and thus he continued : `` It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun , governor , for the king , of the castle of the Bastile , be held by him good and effectual , and be immediately carried into operation . '' 
-LRB- Signed -RRB- D'HERBLAY `` General of the Order , by the grace of God . '' 
Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished , that his features remained contracted , his lips parted , and his eyes fixed . 
He did not move an inch , nor articulate a sound . 
Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth , which was fluttering to its death about the candles . 
Aramis , without even deigning to look at the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition , drew from his pocket a small case of black wax ; he sealed the letter , and stamped it with a seal suspended at his breast , beneath his doublet , and when the operation was concluded , presented - still in silence - the missive to M. de Baisemeaux . 
The latter , whose hands trembled in a manner to excite pity , turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter . 
A last gleam of feeling played over his features , and he fell , as if thunder-struck , on a chair . 
`` Come , come , '' said Aramis , after a long silence , during which the governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses , `` do not lead me to believe , dear Baisemeaux , that the presence of the general of the order is as terrible as His , and that men die merely from having seen Him . 
Take courage , rouse yourself ; give me your hand - obey . '' 
Baisemeaux , reassured , if not satisfied , obeyed , kissed Aramis 's hand , and rose . 
`` Immediately ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` Oh , there is no pressing haste , my host ; take your place again , and do the honors over this beautiful dessert . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I shall never recover such a shock as this ; I who have laughed , who have jested with you ! 
I who have dared to treat you on a footing of equality ! '' 
`` Say nothing about it , old comrade , '' replied the bishop , who perceived how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it ; `` say nothing about it . 
Let us each live in our own way ; to you , my protection and my friendship ; to me , your obedience . 
Having exactly fulfilled these two requirements , let us live happily . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected ; he perceived , at a glance , the consequence of this withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order ; and , putting in the scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general , did not consider it of any value . 
Aramis divined this . 
`` My dear Baisemeaux , '' said he , `` you are a simpleton . 
Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to think for you . '' 
And at another gesture he made , Baisemeaux bowed again . 
`` How shall I set about it ? '' 
he said . 
`` What is the process for releasing a prisoner ? '' 
`` I have the regulations . '' 
`` Well , then , follow the regulations , my friend . '' 
`` I go with my major to the prisoner 's room , and conduct him , if he is a personage of importance . '' 
`` But this Marchiali is not an important personage , '' said Aramis carelessly . 
`` I do n't know , '' answered the governor , as if he would have said , `` It is for you to instruct me . '' 
`` Then if you do n't know it , I am right ; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards one of obscure station . '' 
`` Good ; the regulations so provide . 
They are to the effect that the turnkey , or one of the lower officials , shall bring the prisoner before the governor , in the office . '' 
`` Well , 't is very wise , that ; and then ? '' 
`` Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his imprisonment , his clothes and papers , if the minister 's orders have not otherwise dictated . '' 
`` What was the minister 's order as to this Marchiali ? '' 
`` Nothing ; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels , without papers , and almost without clothes . '' 
`` See how simple , then , all is . 
Indeed , Baisemeaux , you make a mountain of everything . 
Remain here , and make them bring the prisoner to the governor 's house . ''
