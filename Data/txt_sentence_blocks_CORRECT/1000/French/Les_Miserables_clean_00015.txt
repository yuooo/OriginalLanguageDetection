When he entered , he was asked : `` Whence come you ? '' 
He replied : `` From the street . '' 
When he went away , they asked him : `` Whither are you going ? '' 
He replied : `` Into the streets . '' 
His mother said to him : `` What did you come here for ? '' 
This child lived , in this absence of affection , like the pale plants which spring up in cellars . 
It did not cause him suffering , and he blamed no one . 
He did not know exactly how a father and mother should be . 
Nevertheless , his mother loved his sisters . 
We have forgotten to mention , that on the Boulevard du Temple this child was called Little Gavroche . 
Why was he called Little Gavroche ? 
Probably because his father 's name was Jondrette . 
It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread . 
The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor . 
The cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called M. Marius . 
Let us explain who this M. Marius was . 
NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH In the Rue Boucherat , Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named M. Gillenormand , and who mention him with complaisance . 
This good man was old when they were young . 
This silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared -- for those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past -- from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which , under Louis XIV. , the names of all the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day , the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of Europe ; a progression , by the way , in which progress is visible . 
M.Gillenormand , who was as much alive as possible in 1831 , was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed , simply because they have lived a long time , and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody , and now resemble nobody . 
He was a peculiar old man , and in very truth , a man of another age , the real , complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century , who wore his good , old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates . 
He was over ninety years of age , his walk was erect , he talked loudly , saw clearly , drank neat , ate , slept , and snored . 
He had all thirty-two of his teeth . 
He only wore spectacles when he read . 
He was of an amorous disposition , but declared that , for the last ten years , he had wholly and decidedly renounced women . 
He could no longer please , he said ; he did not add : `` I am too old , '' but : `` I am too poor . '' 
He said : `` If I were not ruined -- Heee ! '' 
All he had left , in fact , was an income of about fifteen thousand francs . 
His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses . 
He did not belong , as the reader will perceive , to that puny variety of octogenaries who , like M. de Voltaire , have been dying all their life ; his was no longevity of a cracked pot ; this jovial old man had always had good health . 
He was superficial , rapid , easily angered . 
He flew into a passion at everything , generally quite contrary to all reason . 
When contradicted , he raised his cane ; he beat people as he had done in the great century . 
He had a daughter over fifty years of age , and unmarried , whom he chastised severely with his tongue , when in a rage , and whom he would have liked to whip . 
She seemed to him to be eight years old . 
He boxed his servants ' ears soundly , and said : `` Ah ! 
carogne ! '' 
One of his oaths was : `` By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade ! '' 
He had singular freaks of tranquillity ; he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him , being jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife , a pretty and coquettish barberess . 
M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things , and declared that he was extremely sagacious ; here is one of his sayings : `` I have , in truth , some penetration ; I am able to say when a flea bites me , from what woman it came . '' 
The words which he uttered the most frequently were : the sensible man , and nature . 
He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it , but he made it enter , after his own fashion , into his little chimney-corner satires : `` Nature , '' he said , `` in order that civilization may have a little of everything , gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism . 
Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale . 
The cat is a drawing-room tiger , the lizard is a pocket crocodile . 
The dancers at the opera are pink female savages . 
They do not eat men , they crunch them ; or , magicians that they are , they transform them into oysters and swallow them . 
The Caribbeans leave only the bones , they leave only the shell . 
Such are our morals . 
We do not devour , we gnaw ; we do not exterminate , we claw . '' 
LIKE MASTER , LIKE HOUSE He lived in the Marais , Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire , No. 6 . 
He owned the house . 
This house has since been demolished and rebuilt , and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of Paris undergo . 
He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor , between street and gardens , furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes ; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the arm-chairs . 
He enveloped his bed in a vast , nine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer . 
Long , full curtains hung from the windows , and formed great , broken folds that were very magnificent . 
The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle , by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long , which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility . 
In addition to a library adjoining his chamber , he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal , a gallant and elegant retreat , with magnificent hangings of straw , with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV . 
and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for his mistress . 
M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt , who had died a centenarian . 
He had had two wives . 
His manners were something between those of the courtier , which he had never been , and the lawyer , which he might have been . 
He was gay , and caressing when he had a mind . 
In his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses , because they are , at the same time , the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence . 
He was a connoisseur of painting . 
He had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom , painted by Jordaens , executed with great dashes of the brush , with millions of details , in a confused and hap-hazard manner . 
M. Gillenormand 's attire was not the habit of Louis XIV . 
nor yet that of Louis XVI. ; it was that of the Incroyables of the Directory . 
He had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions . 
His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers , a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons . 
With this he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes . 
He always thrust his hands into his fobs . 
He said authoritatively : `` The French Revolution is a heap of blackguards . '' 
LUC-ESPRIT At the age of sixteen , one evening at the opera , he had had the honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same time -- ripe and celebrated beauties then , and sung by Voltaire , the Camargo and the Salle . 
Caught between two fires , he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer , a young girl named Nahenry , who was sixteen like himself , obscure as a cat , and with whom he was in love . 
He abounded in memories . 
He was accustomed to exclaim : `` How pretty she was -- that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette , the last time I saw her at Longchamps , her hair curled in sustained sentiments , with her come-and-see of turquoises , her gown of the color of persons newly arrived , and her little agitation muff ! '' 
He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin , which he was fond of talking about effusively . 
`` I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin , '' said he . 
Madame de Boufflers , having seen him by chance when he was twenty , had described him as `` a charming fool . '' 
He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power , regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois . 
He read the journals , the newspapers , the gazettes as he said , stifling outbursts of laughter the while . 
`` Oh ! '' 
he said , `` what people these are ! 
Corbiere ! 
Humann ! 
Casimir Perier ! 
There 's a minister for you ! 
I can imagine this in a journal : ` M. Gillenorman , minister ! ' 
that would be a farce . 
Well ! 
They are so stupid that it would pass '' ; he merrily called everything by its name , whether decent or indecent , and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies . 
He uttered coarse speeches , obscenities , and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant . 
It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century . 
It is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose . 
His god-father had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius , and had bestowed on him these two significant names : Luc-Esprit . 
A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins , where he was born , and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais , whom he called the Duc de Nevers . 
Neither the Convention , nor the death of Louis XVI. , nor the Napoleon , nor the return of the Bourbons , nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning . 
The Duc de Nevers was , in his eyes , the great figure of the century . 
`` What a charming grand seigneur , '' he said , `` and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon ! '' 
In the eyes of M. Gillenormand , Catherine the Second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing , for three thousand roubles , the secret of the elixir of gold , from Bestucheff . 
He grew animated on this subject : `` The elixir of gold , '' he exclaimed , `` the yellow dye of Bestucheff , General Lamotte 's drops , in the eighteenth century , -- this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love , the panacea against Venus , at one louis the half-ounce phial . 
Louis XV . 
sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope . '' 
He would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance , had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron . 
M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons , and had a horror of 1789 ; he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the Terror , and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off . 
If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in his presence , he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning . 
He sometimes alluded to his ninety years , and said , `` I hope that I shall not see ninety-three twice . '' 
On these occasions , he hinted to people that he meant to live to be a hundred . 
BASQUE AND NICOLETTE He had theories . 
Here is one of them : `` When a man is passionately fond of women , and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little , who is homely , cross , legitimate , with plenty of rights , perched on the code , and jealous at need , there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace , and that is to let his wife control the purse-strings . 
This abdication sets him free . 
Then his wife busies herself , grows passionately fond of handling coin , gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process , undertakes the education of half-share tenants and the training of farmers , convokes lawyers , presides over notaries , harangues scriveners , visits limbs of the law , follows lawsuits , draws up leases , dictates contracts , feels herself the sovereign , sells , buys , regulates , promises and compromises , binds fast and annuls , yields , concedes and retrocedes , arranges , disarranges , hoards , lavishes ; she commits follies , a supreme and personal delight , and that consoles her . 
While her husband disdains her , she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband . '' 
This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied , and it had become his history . 
His wife -- the second one -- had administered his fortune in such a manner that , one fine day , when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower , there remained to him just sufficient to live on , by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs , three-quarters of which would expire with him . 
He had not hesitated on this point , not being anxious to leave a property behind him . 
Besides , he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures , and , for instance , become national property ; he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents , and he had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt . 
`` All that 's the Rue Quincampois ! '' 
he said . 
His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavaire belonged to him , as we have already stated . 
He had two servants , `` a male and a female . '' 
When a servant entered his establishment , M. Gillenormand re-baptized him . 
He bestowed on the men the name of their province : Nimois , Comtois , Poitevin , Picard . 
His last valet was a big , foundered , short-winded fellow of fifty-five , who was incapable of running twenty paces ; but , as he had been born at Bayonne , M. Gillenormand called him Basque . 
All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette -LRB- even the Magnon , of whom we shall hear more farther on -RRB- . 
One day , a haughty cook , a cordon bleu , of the lofty race of porters , presented herself . 
`` How much wages do you want a month ? '' 
asked M. Gillenormand . 
`` Thirty francs . '' 
`` What is your name ? '' 
`` Olympie . '' 
`` You shall have fifty francs , and you shall be called Nicolette . '' 
IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN With M. Gillenormand , sorrow was converted into wrath ; he was furious at being in despair . 
He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties . 
One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal satisfaction was composed , was , as we have just hinted , that he had remained a brisk spark , and that he passed energetically for such . 
This he called having `` royal renown . '' 
This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls . 
One day , there was brought to him in a basket , as though it had been a basket of oysters , a stout , newly born boy , who was yelling like the deuce , and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes , which a servant-maid , dismissed six months previously , attributed to him . 
M. Gillenormand had , at that time , fully completed his eighty-fourth year . 
Indignation and uproar in the establishment . 
And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that ? 
What audacity ! 
What an abominable calumny ! 
M. Gillenormand himself was not at all enraged . 
He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny , and said in an aside : `` Well , what now ? 
What 's the matter ? 
You are finely taken aback , and really , you are excessively ignorant . 
M. le Duc d'Angouleme , the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX. , married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty-five ; M. Virginal , Marquis d'Alluye , brother to the Cardinal de Sourdis , Archbishop of Bordeaux , had , at the age of eighty-three , by the maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin , a son , a real child of love , who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of state ; one of the great men of this century , the Abbe Tabaraud , is the son of a man of eighty-seven . 
There is nothing out of the ordinary in these things . 
And then , the Bible ! 
Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine . 
Let him be taken care of . 
It is not his fault . '' 
This manner of procedure was good-tempered . 
The woman , whose name was Magnon , sent him another parcel in the following year . 
It was a boy again . 
Thereupon , M. Gillenormand capitulated . 
He sent the two brats back to their mother , promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance , on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more . 
He added : `` I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well . 
I shall go to see them from time to time . '' 
And this he did . 
He had had a brother who was a priest , and who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years , and had died at seventy-nine . 
`` I lost him young , '' said he . 
This brother , of whom but little memory remains , was a peaceable miser , who , being a priest , thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met , but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous , thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise . 
As for M. Gillenormand the elder , he never haggled over his alms-giving , but gave gladly and nobly . 
He was kindly , abrupt , charitable , and if he had been rich , his turn of mind would have been magnificent . 
He desired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner , even his rogueries . 
One day , having been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance , in a gross and apparent manner , he uttered this solemn exclamation : `` That was indecently done ! 
I am really ashamed of this pilfering . 
Everything has degenerated in this century , even the rascals . 
Morbleu ! 
this is not the way to rob a man of my standing . 
I am robbed as though in a forest , but badly robbed . 
Silva , sint consule dignae ! '' 
He had had two wives , as we have already mentioned ; by the first he had had a daughter , who had remained unmarried , and by the second another daughter , who had died at about the age of thirty , who had wedded , through love , or chance , or otherwise , a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire , who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo . 
`` He is the disgrace of my family , '' said the old bourgeois . 
He took an immense amount of snuff , and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand . 
He believed very little in God . 
RULE : RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING Such was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand , who had not lost his hair , -- which was gray rather than white , -- and which was always dressed in `` dog 's ears . '' 
To sum up , he was venerable in spite of all this . 
He had something of the eighteenth century about him ; frivolous and great . 
In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration , M. Gillenormand , who was still young , -- he was only seventy-four , -- lived in the Faubourg Saint Germain , Rue Servandoni , near Saint-Sulpice . 
He had only retired to the Marais when he quitted society , long after attaining the age of eighty . 
And , on abandoning society , he had immured himself in his habits . 
The principal one , and that which was invariable , was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day , and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening . 
He dined at five o'clock , and after that his door was open . 
That had been the fashion of his century , and he would not swerve from it . 
`` The day is vulgar , '' said he , `` and deserves only a closed shutter . 
Fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars . '' 
And he barricaded himself against every one , even had it been the king himself . 
This was the antiquated elegance of his day . 
TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand 's two daughters . 
They had come into the world ten years apart . 
In their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other , either in character or countenance , and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible . 
The youngest had a charming soul , which turned towards all that belongs to the light , was occupied with flowers , with verses , with music , which fluttered away into glorious space , enthusiastic , ethereal , and was wedded from her very youth , in ideal , to a vague and heroic figure . 
The elder had also her chimera ; she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor , a contractor , a splendidly stupid husband , a million made man , or even a prefect ; the receptions of the Prefecture , an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck , official balls , the harangues of the town-hall , to be `` Madame la Prefete , '' -- all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination . 
Thus the two sisters strayed , each in her own dream , at the epoch when they were young girls . 
Both had wings , the one like an angel , the other like a goose . 
No ambition is ever fully realized , here below at least . 
No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day . 
The younger wedded the man of her dreams , but she died . 
The elder did not marry at all . 
At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating , she was an antique virtue , an incombustible prude , with one of the sharpest noses , and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see . 
A characteristic detail ; outside of her immediate family , no one had ever known her first name . 
She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand , the elder . 
In the matter of cant , Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given points to a miss . 
Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness . 
She cherished a frightful memory of her life ; one day , a man had beheld her garter . 
Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty . 
Her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque , and never ascended sufficiently high . 
She multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking . 
The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced . 
Nevertheless , let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence , she allowed an officer of the Lancers , her grand nephew , named Theodule , to embrace her without displeasure . 
In spite of this favored Lancer , the label : Prude , under which we have classed her , suited her to absolute perfection . 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul . 
Prudery is a demi-virtue and a demi-vice . 
To prudery she added bigotry , a well-assorted lining . 
She belonged to the society of the Virgin , wore a white veil on certain festivals , mumbled special orisons , revered `` the holy blood , '' venerated `` the sacred heart , '' remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful , and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble , and through great rays of gilded wood . 
She had a chapel friend , an ancient virgin like herself , named Mademoiselle Vaubois , who was a positive blockhead , and beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle . 
Beyond the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria , Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves . 
Mademoiselle Vaubois , perfect in her style , was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence . 
Let us say it plainly , Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older . 
This is the case with passive natures . 
She had never been malicious , which is relative kindness ; and then , years wear away the angles , and the softening which comes with time had come to her . 
She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret . 
There breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished , and which had never had a beginning . 
She kept house for her father . 
M. Gillenormand had his daughter near him , as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him . 
These households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare , and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support . 
There was also in this house , between this elderly spinster and this old man , a child , a little boy , who was always trembling and mute in the presence of M. Gillenormand . 
M. Gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice , and sometimes , with uplifted cane : `` Here , sir ! 
rascal , scoundrel , come here ! 
-- Answer me , you scamp ! 
Just let me see you , you good-for-nothing ! '' 
etc. , etc. . 
He idolized him . 
This was his grandson . 
We shall meet with this child again later on . 
BOOK THIRD . 
-- THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON AN ANCIENT SALON When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni , he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons . 
Although a bourgeois , M. Gillenormand was received in society . 
As he had a double measure of wit , in the first place , that which was born with him , and secondly , that which was attributed to him , he was even sought out and made much of . 
He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there . 
There are people who will have influence at any price , and who will have other people busy themselves over them ; when they can not be oracles , they turn wags . 
M. Gillenormand was not of this nature ; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing . 
He was an oracle everywhere . 
It had happened to him to hold his own against M. de Bonald , and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee . 
About 1817 , he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood , in the Rue Ferou , with Madame la Baronne de T. , a worthy and respectable person , whose husband had been Ambassador of France to Berlin under Louis XVI . 
Baron de T. , who , during his lifetime , had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions , had died bankrupt , during the emigration , leaving , as his entire fortune , some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub , in ten manuscript volumes , bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges . 
Madame de T. had not published the memoirs , out of pride , and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how . 
Madame de T. lived far from the Court ; `` a very mixed society , '' as she said , in a noble isolation , proud and poor . 
A few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth , and these constituted a purely Royalist salon . 
They sipped tea there , and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century , the charter , the Bonapartists , the prostitution of the blue ribbon , or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII. , according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs ; and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by Monsieur , afterwards Charles X . 
The songs of the fishwomen , in which Napoleon was called Nicolas , were received there with transports of joy . 
Duchesses , the most delicate and charming women in the world , went into ecstasies over couplets like the following , addressed to `` the federates '' : -- Refoncez dans vos culottes -LSB- 20 -RSB- Le bout d' chemis ' qui vous pend . 
Qu'on n ' dis ' pas qu ' les patriotes Ont arbore l' drapeau blanc ? 
-LSB- 20 -RSB- Tuck into your trousers the shirt-tail that is hanging out . 
Let it not be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag . 
There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible , with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous , with quatrains , with distiches even ; thus , upon the Dessolles ministry , a moderate cabinet , of which MM . 
Decazes and Deserre were members : -- Pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base , -LSB- 21 -RSB- Il faut changer de sol , et de serre et de case . 
-LSB- 21 -RSB- In order to re-establish the shaken throne firmly on its base , soil -LRB- Des solles -RRB- , greenhouse and house -LRB- Decazes -RRB- must be changed . 
Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers , `` an abominably Jacobin chamber , '' and from this list they combined alliances of names , in such a manner as to form , for example , phrases like the following : Damas . 
Sabran . 
Gouvion-Saint-Cyr . 
-- All this was done merrily . 
In that society , they parodied the Revolution . 
They used I know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense . 
They sang their little Ca ira : -- Ah ! 
ca ira ca ira ca ira ! 
Les Bonapartistes a la lanterne ! 
Songs are like the guillotine ; they chop away indifferently , to-day this head , to-morrow that . 
It is only a variation . 
In the Fualdes affair , which belongs to this epoch , 1816 , they took part for Bastide and Jausion , because Fualdes was `` a Buonapartist . '' 
They designated the liberals as friends and brothers ; this constituted the most deadly insult . 
Like certain church towers , Madame de T. 's salon had two cocks . 
One of them was M. Gillenormand , the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois , of whom it was whispered about , with a sort of respect : `` Do you know ? 
That is the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace . '' 
These singular amnesties do occur in parties . 
Let us add the following : in the bourgeoisie , honored situations decay through too easy relations ; one must beware whom one admits ; in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold , there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons . 
The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law , as above every other . 
Marigny , the brother of the Pompadour , had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise . 
In spite of ? 
No , because . 
Du Barry , the god-father of the Vaubernier , was very welcome at the house of M. le Marechal de Richelieu . 
This society is Olympus . 
Mercury and the Prince de Guemenee are at home there . 
A thief is admitted there , provided he be a god . 
The Comte de Lamothe , who , in 1815 , was an old man seventy-five years of age , had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air , his cold and angular face , his perfectly polished manners , his coat buttoned up to his cravat , and his long legs always crossed in long , flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna . 
His face was the same color as his trousers . 
This M. de Lamothe was `` held in consideration '' in this salon on account of his `` celebrity '' and , strange to say , though true , because of his name of Valois . 
As for M. Gillenormand , his consideration was of absolutely first-rate quality . 
He had , in spite of his levity , and without its interfering in any way with his dignity , a certain manner about him which was imposing , dignified , honest , and lofty , in a bourgeois fashion ; and his great age added to it . 
One is not a century with impunity . 
The years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment . 
In addition to this , he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock . 
Thus , when the King of Prussia , after having restored Louis XVIII. , came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count de Ruppin , he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV . 
somewhat as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg , and with the most delicate impertinence . 
M. Gillenormand approved : `` All kings who are not the King of France , '' said he , `` are provincial kings . '' 
One day , the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence : `` To what was the editor of the Courrier Francais condemned ? '' 
`` To be suspended . '' 
`` Sus is superfluous , '' observed M. Gillenormand . 
-LSB- 22 -RSB- Remarks of this nature found a situation . 
-LSB- 22 -RSB- Suspendu , suspended ; pendu , hung . 
At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons , he said , on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by : `` There goes his Excellency the Evil One . '' 
M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter , that tall mademoiselle , who was over forty and looked fifty , and by a handsome little boy of seven years , white , rosy , fresh , with happy and trusting eyes , who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him : `` How handsome he is ! 
What a pity ! 
Poor child ! '' 
This child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago . 
He was called `` poor child , '' because he had for a father `` a brigand of the Loire . '' 
This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand 's son-in-law , who has already been mentioned , and whom M. Gillenormand called `` the disgrace of his family . '' 
ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this epoch , and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge , which will soon be succeeded , let us hope , by some hideous iron cable bridge , might have observed , had he dropped his eyes over the parapet , a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap , and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth , to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon , was sewn , shod with wooden sabots , tanned by the sun , his face nearly black and his hair nearly white , a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek , bowed , bent , prematurely aged , who walked nearly every day , hoe and sickle in hand , in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge , and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces , charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say , were they much larger : `` these are gardens , '' and were they a little smaller : `` these are bouquets . '' 
All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end , and on a house at the other . 
The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken , inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817 . 
He lived there alone and solitary , silently and poorly , with a woman who was neither young nor old , neither homely nor pretty , neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise , who served him . 
The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there . 
These flowers were his occupation . 
By dint of labor , of perseverance , of attention , and of buckets of water , he had succeeded in creating after the Creator , and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature . 
He was ingenious ; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould , for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China . 
He was in his alleys from the break of day , in summer , planting , cutting , hoeing , watering , walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness , sadness , and sweetness , sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours , listening to the song of a bird in the trees , the babble of a child in a house , or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass , of which the sun made a carbuncle . 
His table was very plain , and he drank more milk than wine . 
A child could make him give way , and his servant scolded him . 
He was so timid that be seemed shy , he rarely went out , and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure , the Abbe Mabeuf , a good old man . 
Nevertheless , if the inhabitants of the town , or strangers , or any chance comers , curious to see his tulips , rang at his little cottage , he opened his door with a smile . 
He was the `` brigand of the Loire . '' 
Any one who had , at the same time , read military memoirs , biographies , the Moniteur , and the bulletins of the grand army , would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency , the name of Georges Pontmercy . 
When very young , this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in Saintonge 's regiment . 
The revolution broke out . 
Saintonge 's regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine ; for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy , and were only divided into brigades in 1794 . 
Pontmercy fought at Spire , at Worms , at Neustadt , at Turkheim , at Alzey , at Mayence , where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard 's rearguard . 
It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse , behind the old rampart of Andernach , and only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy 's cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis . 
He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel , where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm . 
Then he passed to the frontier of Italy , and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert . 
Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general , and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant . 
Pontmercy was by Berthier 's side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say : `` Berthier has been cannoneer , cavalier , and grenadier . '' 
He beheld his old general , Joubert , fall at Novi , at the moment when , with uplifted sabre , he was shouting : `` Forward ! '' 
Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign , on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast , he fell into a wasps ' - nest of seven or eight English vessels . 
The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea , to hide the soldiers between decks , and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel . 
Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak , and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates . 
Twenty leagues further on , his audacity having increased , he attacked with his pinnace , and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily , and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea . 
In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand . 
At Weltingen he received into his arms , beneath a storm of bullets , Colonel Maupetit , mortally wounded at the head of the 9th Dragoons . 
He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy 's fire . 
When the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line , Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the Guard . 
The Emperor gave him the cross . 
Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua , Melas , and Alexandria , Mack at Ulm , made prisoners in succession . 
He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier commanded , and which captured Hamburg . 
Then he was transferred to the 55th of the line , which was the old regiment of Flanders . 
At Eylau he was in the cemetery where , for the space of two hours , the heroic Captain Louis Hugo , the uncle of the author of this book , sustained alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army . 
Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery . 
He was at Friedland . 
Then he saw Moscow . 
Then La Beresina , then Lutzen , Bautzen , Dresden , Wachau , Leipzig , and the defiles of Gelenhausen ; then Montmirail , Chateau-Thierry , Craon , the banks of the Marne , the banks of the Aisne , and the redoubtable position of Laon . 
At Arnay-Le-Duc , being then a captain , he put ten Cossacks to the sword , and saved , not his general , but his corporal . 
He was well slashed up on this occasion , and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone . 
Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry . 
He had what was called under the old regime , the double hand , that is to say , an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier , or a squadron or a battalion as an officer . 
It is from this aptitude , perfected by a military education , which certain special branches of the service arise , the dragoons , for example , who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time . 
He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba . 
At Waterloo , he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers , in Dubois ' brigade . 
It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion . 
He came and cast the flag at the Emperor 's feet . 
He was covered with blood . 
While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across his face . 
The Emperor , greatly pleased , shouted to him : `` You are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the Legion of Honor ! '' 
Pontmercy replied : `` Sire , I thank you for my widow . '' 
An hour later , he fell in the ravine of Ohain . 
Now , who was this Georges Pontmercy ? 
He was this same `` brigand of the Loire . '' 
We have already seen something of his history . 
After Waterloo , Pontmercy , who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain , as it will be remembered , had succeeded in joining the army , and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire . 
The Restoration had placed him on half-pay , then had sent him into residence , that is to say , under surveillance , at Vernon . 
King Louis XVIII. , regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all , did not recognize his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor , nor his grade of colonel , nor his title of baron . 
He , on his side , neglected no occasion of signing himself `` Colonel Baron Pontmercy . '' 
He had only an old blue coat , and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor . 
The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for `` illegal '' wearing of this decoration . 
When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary , Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile : `` I do not know whether I no longer understand French , or whether you no longer speak it ; but the fact is that I do not understand . '' 
Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette . 
They dared not interfere with him . 
Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address : A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy . '' 
He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken . 
At the same moment , Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to General Bonaparte . 
Pontmercy had ended , may we be pardoned the expression , by having in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor . 
In the same way , there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute Flaminius , and who had a little of Hannibal 's spirit . 
One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of Vernon , stepped up to him , and said : `` Mr. Crown Attorney , am I permitted to wear my scar ? '' 
He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron . 
He had hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon . 
He lived there alone , we have just seen how . 
Under the Empire , between two wars , he had found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand . 
The old bourgeois , thoroughly indignant at bottom , had given his consent with a sigh , saying : `` The greatest families are forced into it . '' 
In 1815 , Madame Pontmercy , an admirable woman in every sense , by the way , lofty in sentiment and rare , and worthy of her husband , died , leaving a child . 
This child had been the colonel 's joy in his solitude ; but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson , declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him . 
The father had yielded in the little one 's interest , and had transferred his love to flowers . 
Moreover , he had renounced everything , and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired . 
He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done . 
He passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz . 
M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law . 
The colonel was `` a bandit '' to him . 
M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel , except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to `` his Baronship . '' 
It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him , under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited . 
For the Gillenormands , Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague . 
They intended to bring up the child in their own way . 
Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions , but he submitted to them , thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself . 
The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much ; but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable . 
This aunt , who had remained unmarried , was very rich on the maternal side , and her sister 's son was her natural heir . 
The boy , whose name was Marius , knew that he had a father , but nothing more . 
No one opened his mouth to him about it . 
Nevertheless , in the society into which his grandfather took him , whispers , innuendoes , and winks , had eventually enlightened the little boy 's mind ; he had finally understood something of the case , and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were , so to speak , the air he breathed , by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration , he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart . 
While he was growing up in this fashion , the colonel slipped away every two or three months , came to Paris on the sly , like a criminal breaking his ban , and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice , at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass . 
There , trembling lest the aunt should turn round , concealed behind a pillar , motionless , not daring to breathe , he gazed at his child . 
The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster . 
From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon , M. l'Abbe Mabeuf . 
That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice , who had often observed this man gazing at his child , and the scar on his cheek , and the large tears in his eyes . 
That man , who had so manly an air , yet who was weeping like a woman , had struck the warden . 
That face had clung to his mind . 
One day , having gone to Vernon to see his brother , he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge , and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice . 
The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure , and both had paid the colonel a visit , on some pretext or other . 
This visit led to others . 
The colonel , who had been extremely reserved at first , ended by opening his heart , and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history , and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child 's future . 
This caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness , and the colonel , on his side , became fond of the cure . 
And moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier . 
At bottom , the man is the same . 
The one has devoted his life to his country here below , the other to his country on high ; that is the only difference . 
Twice a year , on the first of January and on St. George 's day , Marius wrote duty letters to his father , which were dictated by his aunt , and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula ; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated ; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread . 
REQUIESCANT Madame de T. 's salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world . 
It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life . 
This opening was sombre , and more cold than warmth , more night than day , came to him through this skylight . 
This child , who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world , soon became melancholy , and , what is still more contrary to his age , grave . 
Surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages , he gazed about him with serious amazement . 
Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him . 
There were in Madame de T. 's salon some very noble ladies named Mathan , Noe , Levis , -- which was pronounced Levi , -- Cambis , pronounced Cambyse . 
These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child 's mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart , and when they were all there , seated in a circle around a dying fire , sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green , with their severe profiles , their gray or white hair , their long gowns of another age , whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished , dropping , at rare intervals , words which were both majestic and severe , little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes , in the conviction that he beheld not women , but patriarchs and magi , not real beings , but phantoms . 
With these phantoms , priests were sometimes mingled , frequenters of this ancient salon , and some gentlemen ; the Marquis de Sass **** , private secretary to Madame de Berry , the Vicomte de Val *** , who published , under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine , monorhymed odes , the Prince de Beauff ******* , who , though very young , had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife , whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows , the Marquis de C ***** d' E ****** , the man in all France who best understood `` proportioned politeness , '' the Comte d'Am ***** , the kindly man with the amiable chin , and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy , a pillar of the library of the Louvre , called the King 's cabinet , M. de Port-de-Guy , bald , and rather aged than old , was wont to relate that in 1793 , at the age of sixteen , he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian , the Bishop of Mirepoix , also refractory , but as a priest , while he was so in the capacity of a soldier . 
This was at Toulon . 
Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day ; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses , and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck , which was dry in the morning and wet at night . 
These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T. 's salon , and by dint of cursing Marat , they applauded Trestaillon . 
Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there ; M. Thibord du Chalard , M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt , and the celebrated scoffer of the right , M. Cornet-Dincourt . 
The bailiff de Ferrette , with his short breeches and his thin legs , sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand . 
He had been M. le Comte d'Artois ' companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe , he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours , and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff . 
As for the priests , there was the Abbe Halma , the same to whom M. Larose , his collaborator on la Foudre , said : `` Bah ! 
Who is there who is not fifty years old ? 
a few greenhorns perhaps ? '' 
The Abbe Letourneur , preacher to the King , the Abbe Frayssinous , who was not , as yet , either count , or bishop , or minister , or peer , and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing , and the Abbe Keravenant , Cure of Saint-Germain-des-Pres ; also the Pope 's Nuncio , then Monsignor Macchi , Archbishop of Nisibi , later on Cardinal , remarkable for his long , pensive nose , and another Monsignor , entitled thus : Abbate Palmieri , domestic prelate , one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See , Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica , Advocate of the saints , Postulatore dei Santi , which refers to matters of canonization , and signifies very nearly : Master of Requests of the section of Paradise . 
Lastly , two cardinals , M. de la Luzerne , and M. de Cl ****** T ******* . 
The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have , a few years later , the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand ; M. de Cl ****** T ******* was Archbishop of Toul **** , and often made trips to Paris , to his nephew , the Marquis de T ******* , who was Minister of Marine and War . 
The Cardinal of Cl ****** T ******* was a merry little man , who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock ; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopaedia , and his desperate play at billiards , and persons who , at that epoch , passed through the Rue M ***** on summer evenings , where the hotel de Cl ****** T ******* then stood , halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist , Monseigneur Cotiret , Bishop in partibus of Caryste : `` Mark , Abbe , I make a cannon . '' 
The Cardinal de Cl ****** T ******* had been brought to Madame de T. 's by his most intimate friend , M. de Roquelaure , former Bishop of Senlis , and one of the Forty . 
M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy ; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings , the curious could , on every Tuesday , contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis , usually standing erect , freshly powdered , in violet hose , with his back turned to the door , apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar . 
All these ecclesiastics , though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen , added to the gravity of the T. salon , whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France , the Marquis de Vib **** , the Marquis de Tal *** , the Marquis de Herb ******* , the Vicomte Damb *** , and the Duc de Val ******** . 
This Duc de Val ******** , although Prince de Mon *** , that is to say a reigning prince abroad , had so high an idea of France and its peerage , that he viewed everything through their medium . 
It was he who said : `` The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome ; the lords are the peers of France of England . '' 
Moreover , as it is indispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century , this feudal salon was , as we have said , dominated by a bourgeois . 
M. Gillenormand reigned there . 
There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society . 
There reputations , even Royalist reputations , were held in quarantine . 
There is always a trace of anarchy in renown . 
Chateaubriand , had he entered there , would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene . 
Some of the scoffed-at did , nevertheless , penetrate thither on sufferance . 
Comte Beug *** was received there , subject to correction . 
The `` noble '' salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons . 
The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now . 
The Royalists of to-day are demagogues , let us record it to their credit . 
At Madame de T. 's the society was superior , taste was exquisite and haughty , under the cover of a great show of politeness . 
Manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself , buried but still alive . 
Some of these habits , especially in the matter of language , seem eccentric . 
Persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique . 
A woman was called Madame la Generale . 
Madame la Colonelle was not entirely disused . 
The charming Madame de Leon , in memory , no doubt , of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse , preferred this appellation to her title of Princesse . 
The Marquise de Crequy was also called Madame la Colonelle . 
It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the refinement of speaking to the King in private as the King , in the third person , and never as Your Majesty , the designation of Your Majesty having been `` soiled by the usurper . '' 
Men and deeds were brought to judgment there . 
They jeered at the age , which released them from the necessity of understanding it . 
They abetted each other in amazement . 
They communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed . 
Methuselah bestowed information on Epimenides . 
The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things . 
They declared that the time which had elasped since Coblentz had not existed . 
In the same manner that Louis XVIII . 
was by the grace of God , in the five and twentieth year of his reign , the emigrants were , by rights , in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence . 
All was harmonious ; nothing was too much alive ; speech hardly amounted to a breath ; the newspapers , agreeing with the salons , seemed a papyrus . 
There were some young people , but they were rather dead . 
The liveries in the antechamber were antiquated . 
These utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp . 
They all had the air of having lived a long time ago , and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre . 
Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of Conserver , Conservation , Conservateur ; to be in good odor , -- that was the point . 
There are , in fact , aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups , and their ideas smelled of it . 
It was a mummified society . 
The masters were embalmed , the servants were stuffed with straw . 
A worthy old marquise , an emigree and ruined , who had but a solitary maid , continued to say : `` My people . '' 
What did they do in Madame de T. 's salon ? 
They were ultra . 
To be ultra ; this word , although what it represents may not have disappeared , has no longer any meaning at the present day . 
Let us explain it . 
To be ultra is to go beyond . 
It is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne , and the mitre in the name of the attar ; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging , it is to kick over the traces ; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics ; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry ; it is to insult through excess of respect ; it is to discover that the Pope is not sufficiently papish , that the King is not sufficiently royal , and that the night has too much light ; it is to be discontented with alabaster , with snow , with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness ; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy ; it is to be so strongly for , as to be against . 
The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the Restoration . 
Nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in 1814 and terminates about 1820 , with the advent of M. de Villele , the practical man of the Right . 
These six years were an extraordinary moment ; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy , smiling and sombre , illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered , at the same time , with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past . 
There existed in that light and that shadow , a complete little new and old world , comic and sad , juvenile and senile , which was rubbing its eyes ; nothing resembles an awakening like a return ; a group which regarded France with ill-temper , and which France regarded with irony ; good old owls of marquises by the streetful , who had returned , and of ghosts , the `` former '' subjects of amazement at everything , brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in France but wept also , delighted to behold their country once more , in despair at not finding their monarchy ; the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire , that is to say , the nobility of the sword , with scorn ; historic races who had lost the sense of history ; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon . 
The swords , as we have just remarked , returned the insult ; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron ; the sword of Marengo was odious and was only a sabre . 
Former days did not recognize Yesterday . 
People no longer had the feeling for what was grand . 
There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin . 
This Society no longer exists . 
Nothing of it , we repeat , exists to-day . 
When we select from it some one figure at random , and attempt to make it live again in thought , it seems as strange to us as the world before the Deluge . 
It is because it , too , as a matter of fact , has been engulfed in a deluge . 
It has disappeared beneath two Revolutions . 
What billows are ideas ! 
How quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury , and how promptly they create frightful gulfs ! 
Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire . 
These salons had a literature and politics of their own . 
They believed in Fievee . 
M. Agier laid down the law in them . 
They commentated M. Colnet , the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais . 
Napoleon was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre . 
Later on the introduction into history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte , Lieutenant-General of the King 's armies , was a concession to the spirit of the age . 
These salons did not long preserve their purity . 
Beginning with 1818 , doctrinarians began to spring up in them , a disturbing shade . 
Their way was to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so . 
Where the ultras were very proud , the doctrinarians were rather ashamed . 
They had wit ; they had silence ; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance ; they should have succeeded . 
They indulged , and usefully too , in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats . 
The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth . 
They assumed the poses of wise men . 
They dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle . 
They opposed , and sometimes with rare intelligence , conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes . 
They were heard to say : `` Thanks for Royalism ! 
It has rendered more than one service . 
It has brought back tradition , worship , religion , respect . 
It is faithful , brave , chivalric , loving , devoted . 
It has mingled , though with regret , the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation . 
Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution , the Empire , glory , liberty , young ideas , young generations , the age . 
But this mistake which it makes with regard to us , -- have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them ? 
The Revolution , whose heirs we are , ought to be intelligent on all points . 
To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism . 
What an error ! 
And what blindness ! 
Revolutionary France is wanting in respect towards historic France , that is to say , towards its mother , that is to say , towards itself . 
After the 5th of September , the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire was treated after the 5th of July . 
They were unjust to the eagle , we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys . 
It seems that we must always have something to proscribe ! 
Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis XIV. , to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV . ? 
We scoff at M. de Vaublanc for erasing the N 's from the bridge of Jena ! 
What was it that he did ? 
What are we doing ? 
Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo . 
The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N 's . 
That is our patrimony . 
To what purpose shall we diminish it ? 
We must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present . 
Why not accept the whole of history ? 
Why not love the whole of France ? 
It is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism , which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection . 
The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism , congregation characterized the second . 
Skill follows ardor . 
Let us confine ourselves here to this sketch . 
In the course of this narrative , the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history ; he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it , and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown to-day . 
But he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea . 
Souvenirs both respectful and affectionate , for they touch his mother , attach him to this past . 
Moreover , let us remark , this same petty world had a grandeur of its own . 
One may smile at it , but one can neither despise nor hate it . 
It was the France of former days . 
Marius Pontmercy pursued some studies , as all children do . 
When he emerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand , his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence . 
This young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant . 
Marius went through his years of college , then he entered the law school . 
He was a Royalist , fanatical and severe . 
He did not love his grandfather much , as the latter 's gayety and cynicism repelled him , and his feelings towards his father were gloomy . 
He was , on the whole , a cold and ardent , noble , generous , proud , religious , enthusiastic lad ; dignified to harshness , pure to shyness . 
END OF THE BRIGAND The conclusion of Marius ' classical studies coincided with M. Gillenormand 's departure from society . 
The old man bade farewell to the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T. 's salon , and established himself in the Mardis , in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire . 
There he had for servants , in addition to the porter , that chambermaid , Nicolette , who had succeeded to Magnon , and that short-breathed and pursy Basque , who have been mentioned above . 
In 1827 , Marius had just attained his seventeenth year . 
One evening , on his return home , he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand . 
`` Marius , '' said M. Gillenormand , `` you will set out for Vernon to-morrow . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` To see your father . '' 
Marius was seized with a trembling fit . 
He had thought of everything except this -- that he should one day be called upon to see his father . 
Nothing could be more unexpected , more surprising , and , let us admit it , more disagreeable to him . 
It was forcing estrangement into reconciliation . 
It was not an affliction , but it was an unpleasant duty . 
Marius , in addition to his motives of political antipathy , was convinced that his father , the slasher , as M. Gillenormand called him on his amiable days , did not love him ; this was evident , since he had abandoned him to others . 
Feeling that he was not beloved , he did not love . 
`` Nothing is more simple , '' he said to himself . 
He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand . 
The grandfather resumed : -- `` It appears that he is ill . 
He demands your presence . '' 
And after a pause , he added : -- `` Set out to-morrow morning . 
I think there is a coach which leaves the Cour des Fontaines at six o'clock , and which arrives in the evening . 
Take it . 
He says that here is haste . '' 
Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket . 
Marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning . 
A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi took the trip to Rouen by night at that date , and passed through Vernon . 
Neither Marius nor M.Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it . 
The next day , at twilight , Marius reached Vernon . 
People were just beginning to light their candles . 
He asked the first person whom be met for `` M. Pontmercy 's house . '' 
For in his own mind , he agreed with the Restoration , and like it , did not recognize his father 's claim to the title of either colonel or baron . 
The house was pointed out to him . 
He rang ; a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door . 
`` M. Pontmercy ? '' 
said Marius . 
The woman remained motionless . 
`` Is this his house ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
The woman nodded affirmatively . 
`` Can I speak with him ? '' 
The woman shook her head . 
`` But I am his son ! '' 
persisted Marius . 
`` He is expecting me . '' 
`` He no longer expects you , '' said the woman . 
Then he perceived that she was weeping . 
She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor ; he entered . 
In that room , which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the chimney-piece , there were three men , one standing erect , another kneeling , and one lying at full length , on the floor in his shirt . 
The one on the floor was the colonel . 
The other two were the doctor , and the priest , who was engaged in prayer . 
The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously . 
As he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness , he had written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son . 
The malady had grown worse . 
On the very evening of Marius ' arrival at Vernon , the colonel had had an attack of delirium ; he had risen from his bed , in spite of the servant 's efforts to prevent him , crying : `` My son is not coming ! 
I shall go to meet him ! '' 
Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber . 
He had just expired . 
The doctor had been summoned , and the cure . 
The doctor had arrived too late . 
The son had also arrived too late . 
By the dim light of the candle , a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel 's cheek , where it had trickled from his dead eye . 
The eye was extinguished , but the tear was not yet dry . 
That tear was his son 's delay . 
Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time , on that venerable and manly face , on those open eyes which saw not , on those white locks , those robust limbs , on which , here and there , brown lines , marking sword-thrusts , and a sort of red stars , which indicated bullet-holes , were visible . 
He contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted goodness . 
He reflected that this man was his father , and that this man was dead , and a chill ran over him . 
The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death . 
Anguish , poignant anguish , was in that chamber . 
The servant-woman was lamenting in a corner , the cure was praying , and his sobs were audible , the doctor was wiping his eyes ; the corpse itself was weeping . 
The doctor , the priest , and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word ; he was the stranger there . 
Marius , who was far too little affected , felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude ; he held his hat in his hand ; and he dropped it on the floor , in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it . 
At the same time , he experienced remorse , and he despised himself for behaving in this manner . 
But was it his fault ? 
He did not love his father ? 
Why should he ! 
The colonel had left nothing . 
The sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial . 
The servant found a scrap of paper , which she handed to Marius . 
It contained the following , in the colonel 's handwriting : -- `` For my son . 
-- The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of Waterloo . 
Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I purchased with my blood , my son shall take it and bear it . 
That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course . '' 
Below , the colonel had added : `` At that same battle of Waterloo , a sergeant saved my life . 
The man 's name was Thenardier . 
I think that he has recently been keeping a little inn , in a village in the neighborhood of Paris , at Chelles or Montfermeil . 
If my son meets him , he will do all the good he can to Thenardier . '' 
Marius took this paper and preserved it , not out of duty to his father , but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man . 
Nothing remained of the colonel . 
M. Gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an old-clothes dealer . 
The neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers . 
The other plants turned to nettles and weeds , and died . 
Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon . 
After the interment he returned to Paris , and applied himself again to his law studies , with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived . 
In two days the colonel was buried , and in three forgotten . 
Marius wore crape on his hat . 
That was all . 
THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS , IN ORDER TO BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood . 
One Sunday , when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice , at that same chapel of the Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad , he placed himself behind a pillar , being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion , and knelt down , without paying any special heed , upon a chair of Utrecht velvet , on the back of which was inscribed this name : Monsieur Mabeuf , warden . 
Mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to Marius : -- `` This is my place , sir . '' 
Marius stepped aside promptly , and the old man took possession of his chair . 
The mass concluded , Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant ; the old man approached him again and said : -- `` I beg your pardon , sir , for having disturbed you a while ago , and for again disturbing you at this moment ; you must have thought me intrusive , and I will explain myself . '' 
`` There is no need of that , Sir , '' said Marius . 
`` Yes ! '' 
went on the old man , `` I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me . 
You see , I am attached to this place . 
It seems to me that the mass is better from here . 
Why ? 
I will tell you . 
It is from this place , that I have watched a poor , brave father come regularly , every two or three months , for the last ten years , since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child , because he was prevented by family arrangements . 
He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass . 
The little one never suspected that his father was there . 
Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father , poor innocent ! 
The father kept behind a pillar , so that he might not be seen . 
He gazed at his child and he wept . 
He adored that little fellow , poor man ! 
I could see that . 
This spot has become sanctified in my sight , and I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass . 
I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right , in my capacity of warden . 
I knew that unhappy gentleman a little , too . 
He had a father-in-law , a wealthy aunt , relatives , I do n't know exactly what all , who threatened to disinherit the child if he , the father , saw him . 
He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day . 
He was separated from him because of political opinions . 
Certainly , I approve of political opinions , but there are people who do not know where to stop . 
Mon Dieu ! 
a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo ; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that . 
He was one of Bonaparte 's colonels . 
He is dead , I believe . 
He lived at Vernon , where I have a brother who is a cure , and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy . 
He had a fine sword-cut , on my honor . '' 
`` Pontmercy , '' suggested Marius , turning pale . 
`` Precisely , Pontmercy . 
Did you know him ? '' 
`` Sir , '' said Marius , `` he was my father . '' 
The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed : -- `` Ah ! 
you are the child ! 
Yes , that 's true , he must be a man by this time . 
Well ! 
poor child , you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly ! '' 
Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings . 
On the following day , he said to M. Gillenormand : -- `` I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends . 
Will you permit me to be absent for three days ? '' 
`` Four ! '' 
replied his grandfather . 
`` Go and amuse yourself . '' 
And he said to his daughter in a low tone , and with a wink , `` Some love affair ! '' 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on . 
Marius was absent for three days , then he returned to Paris , went straight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the Moniteur . 
He read the Moniteur , he read all the histories of the Republic and the Empire , the Memorial de Sainte-Helene , all the memoirs , all the newspapers , the bulletins , the proclamations ; he devoured everything . 
The first time that he came across his father 's name in the bulletins of the grand army , he had a fever for a week . 
He went to see the generals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served , among others , Comte H. Church-warden Mabeuf , whom he went to see again , told him about the life at Vernon , the colonel 's retreat , his flowers , his solitude . 
Marius came to a full knowledge of that rare , sweet , and sublime man , that species of lion-lamb who had been his father . 
In the meanwhile , occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thoughts , he hardly saw the Gillenormands at all . 
He made his appearance at meals ; then they searched for him , and he was not to be found . 
Father Gillenormand smiled . 
`` Bah ! 
bah ! 
He is just of the age for the girls ! '' 
Sometimes the old man added : `` The deuce ! 
I thought it was only an affair of gallantry , It seems that it is an affair of passion ! '' 
It was a passion , in fact . 
Marius was on the high road to adoring his father . 
At the same time , his ideas underwent an extraordinary change . 
The phases of this change were numerous and successive . 
As this is the history of many minds of our day , we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all . 
That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him . 
The first effect was to dazzle him . 
Up to that time , the Republic , the Empire , had been to him only monstrous words . 
The Republic , a guillotine in the twilight ; the Empire , a sword in the night . 
He had just taken a look at it , and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows , he had beheld , with a sort of unprecedented surprise , mingled with fear and joy , stars sparkling , Mirabeau , Vergniaud , Saint-Just , Robespierre , Camille , Desmoulins , Danton , and a sun arise , Napoleon . 
He did not know where he stood . 
He recoiled , blinded by the brilliant lights . 
Little by little , when his astonishment had passed off , he grew accustomed to this radiance , he contemplated these deeds without dizziness , he examined these personages without terror ; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves luminously , in perspective , before his mind 's eye ; he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts : the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses , the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe ; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution , and the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire . 
He asserted in his conscience , that all this had been good . 
What his dazzled state neglected in this , his first far too synthetic estimation , we do not think it necessary to point out here . 
It is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording . 
Progress is not accomplished in one stage . 
That stated , once for all , in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow , we continue . 
He then perceived that , up to that moment , he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father . 
He had not known either the one or the other , and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes . 
Now he saw , and on the one hand he admired , while on the other he adored . 
He was filled with regret and remorse , and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb . 
Oh ! 
if his father had still been in existence , if he had still had him , if God , in his compassion and his goodness , had permitted his father to be still among the living , how he would have run , how he would have precipitated himself , how he would have cried to his father : `` Father ! 
Here I am ! 
It is I ! 
I have the same heart as thou ! 
I am thy son ! '' 
How he would have embraced that white head , bathed his hair in tears , gazed upon his scar , pressed his hands , adored his garment , kissed his feet ! 
Oh ! 
Why had his father died so early , before his time , before the justice , the love of his son had come to him ? 
Marius had a continual sob in his heart , which said to him every moment : `` Alas ! '' 
At the same time , he became more truly serious , more truly grave , more sure of his thought and his faith . 
At each instant , gleams of the true came to complete his reason . 
An inward growth seemed to be in progress within him . 
He was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement , which gave him two things that were new to him -- his father and his country . 
As everything opens when one has a key , so he explained to himself that which he had hated , he penetrated that which he had abhorred ; henceforth he plainly perceived the providential , divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest , and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse . 
When he reflected on his former opinions , which were but those of yesterday , and which , nevertheless , seemed to him already so very ancient , he grew indignant , yet he smiled . 
From the rehabilitation of his father , he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of Napoleon . 
But the latter , we will confess , was not effected without labor . 
From his infancy , he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of 1814 , on Bonaparte . 
Now , all the prejudices of the Restoration , all its interests , all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon . 
It execrated him even more than it did Robespierre . 
It had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation , and the hatred of mothers . 
Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster , and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people , which , as we lately pointed out , resembles the imagination of children , the party of 1814 made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession , from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque , from Tiberius to the bugaboo . 
Thus , in speaking of Bonaparte , one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter , provided that hatred lay at the bottom . 
Marius had never entertained -- about that man , as he was called -- any other ideas in his mind . 
They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature . 
There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon . 
On reading history , on studying him , especially in the documents and materials for history , the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes of Marius was gradually rent . 
He caught a glimpse of something immense , and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment , on the score of Bonaparte as about all the rest ; each day he saw more distinctly ; and he set about mounting , slowly , step by step , almost regretfully in the beginning , then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination , first the sombre steps , then the vaguely illuminated steps , at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm . 
One night , he was alone in his little chamber near the roof . 
His candle was burning ; he was reading , with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window . 
All sorts of reveries reached him from space , and mingled with his thoughts . 
What a spectacle is the night ! 
One hears dull sounds , without knowing whence they proceed ; one beholds Jupiter , which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth , glowing like a firebrand , the azure is black , the stars shine ; it is formidable . 
He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army , those heroic strophes penned on the field of battle ; there , at intervals , he beheld his father 's name , always the name of the Emperor ; the whole of that great Empire presented itself to him ; he felt a flood swelling and rising within him ; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath , and whispered in his ear ; he gradually got into a singular state ; he thought that he heard drums , cannon , trumpets , the measured tread of battalions , the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry ; from time to time , his eyes were raised heavenward , and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space , then they fell upon his book once more , and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly . 
His heart contracted within him . 
He was in a transport , trembling , panting . 
All at once , without himself knowing what was in him , and what impulse he was obeying , he sprang to his feet , stretched both arms out of the window , gazed intently into the gloom , the silence , the infinite darkness , the eternal immensity , and exclaimed : `` Long live the Emperor ! '' 
From that moment forth , all was over ; the Ogre of Corsica , -- the usurper , -- the tyrant , -- the monster who was the lover of his own sisters , -- the actor who took lessons of Talma , -- the poisoner of Jaffa , -- the tiger , -- Buonaparte , -- all this vanished , and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone , at an inaccessible height , the pale marble phantom of Caesar . 
The Emperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires , for whom one sacrifices one 's self ; he was something more to Marius . 
He was the predestined constructor of the French group , succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe . 
He was a prodigious architect , of a destruction , the continuer of Charlemagne , of Louis XI. , of Henry IV. , of Richelieu , of Louis XIV. , and of the Committee of Public Safety , having his spots , no doubt , his faults , his crimes even , being a man , that is to say ; but august in his faults , brilliant in his spots , powerful in his crime . 
He was the predestined man , who had forced all nations to say : `` The great nation ! '' 
He was better than that , he was the very incarnation of France , conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped , and the world by the light which he shed . 
Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier , and which will guard the future . 
Despot but dictator ; a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution . 
Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus Christ is the man-God . 
It will be perceived , that like all new converts to a religion , his conversion intoxicated him , he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far . 
His nature was so constructed ; once on the downward slope , it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag . 
Fanaticism for the sword took possession of him , and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea . 
He did not perceive that , along with genius , and pell-mell , he was admitting force , that is to say , that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry , on the one hand that which is divine , on the other that which is brutal . 
In many respects , he had set about deceiving himself otherwise . 
He admitted everything . 
There is a way of encountering error while on one 's way to the truth . 
He had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump . 
In the new path which he had entered on , in judging the mistakes of the old regime , as in measuring the glory of Napoleon , he neglected the attenuating circumstances . 
At all events , a tremendous step had been taken . 
Where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy , he now saw the advent of France . 
His orientation had changed . 
What had been his East became the West . 
He had turned squarely round . 
All these revolutions were accomplished within him , without his family obtaining an inkling of the case . 
When , during this mysterious labor , he had entirely shed his old Bourbon and ultra skin , when he had cast off the aristocrat , the Jacobite and the Royalist , when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist , profoundly democratic and republican , he went to an engraver on the Quai des Orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name : Le Baron Marius Pontmercy . 
This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him , a change in which everything gravitated round his father . 
Only , as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter , he put them in his pocket . 
By another natural consequence , in proportion as he drew nearer to his father , to the latter 's memory , and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before , he receded from his grandfather . 
We have long ago said , that M. Gillenormand 's temper did not please him . 
There already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man . 
The gayety of Geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther . 
So long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both , Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge . 
When the bridge fell , an abyss was formed . 
And then , over and above all , Marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt , when he reflected that it was M. Gillenormand who had , from stupid motives , torn him ruthlessly from the colonel , thus depriving the father of the child , and the child of the father . 
By dint of pity for his father , Marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather . 
Nothing of this sort , however , was betrayed on the exterior , as we have already said . 
Only he grew colder and colder ; laconic at meals , and rare in the house . 
When his aunt scolded him for it , he was very gentle and alleged his studies , his lectures , the examinations , etc. , as a pretext . 
His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis : `` In love ! 
I know all about it . '' 
From time to time Marius absented himself . 
`` Where is it that he goes off like this ? '' 
said his aunt . 
On one of these trips , which were always very brief , he went to Montfermeil , in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him , and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo , the inn-keeper Thenardier . 
Thenardier had failed , the inn was closed , and no one knew what had become of him . 
Marius was away from the house for four days on this quest . 
`` He is getting decidedly wild , '' said his grandfather . 
They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast , under his shirt , which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon . 
SOME PETTICOAT We have mentioned a lancer . 
He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand , on the paternal side , who led a garrison life , outside the family and far from the domestic hearth . 
Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer . 
He had `` a lady 's waist , '' a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook . 
He visited Paris very rarely , and so rarely that Marius had never seen him . 
The cousins knew each other only by name . 
We think we have said that Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand , who preferred him because she did not see him . 
Not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections . 
One morning , Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing . 
Marius had just asked his grandfather 's permission to take a little trip , adding that he meant to set out that very evening . 
`` Go ! '' 
had been his grandfather 's reply , and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside , as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead : `` Here he is passing the night out again . '' 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled , and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation : `` This is too much ! '' 
-- and this interrogation : `` But where is it that he goes ? '' 
She espied some adventure of the heart , more or less illicit , a woman in the shadow , a rendezvous , a mystery , and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair . 
Tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal ; sainted souls do not detest this . 
There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry . 
So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history . 
In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont , she took refuge in her talents , and set about scalloping , with one layer of cotton after another , one of those embroideries of the Empire and the Restoration , in which there are numerous cart-wheels . 
The work was clumsy , the worker cross . 
She had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened . 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose . 
Lieutenant Theodule stood before her , making the regulation salute . 
She uttered a cry of delight . 
One may be old , one may be a prude , one may be pious , one may be an aunt , but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one 's chamber . 
`` You here , Theodule ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
`` On my way through town , aunt . '' 
`` Embrace me . '' 
`` Here goes ! '' 
said Theodule . 
And he kissed her . 
Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and opened it . 
`` You will remain with us a week at least ? '' 
`` I leave this very evening , aunt . '' 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
`` Mathematically ! '' 
`` Remain , my little Theodule , I beseech you . '' 
`` My heart says ` yes , ' but my orders say ` no . ' 
The matter is simple . 
They are changing our garrison ; we have been at Melun , we are being transferred to Gaillon . 
It is necessary to pass through Paris in order to get from the old post to the new one . 
I said : ` I am going to see my aunt . ' '' 
`` Here is something for your trouble . '' 
And she put ten louis into his hand . 
`` For my pleasure , you mean to say , my dear aunt . '' 
Theodule kissed her again , and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform . 
`` Are you making the journey on horseback , with your regiment ? '' 
she asked him . 
`` No , aunt . 
I wanted to see you . 
I have special permission . 
My servant is taking my horse ; I am travelling by diligence . 
And , by the way , I want to ask you something . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so , too ? '' 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
said his aunt , suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity . 
`` On my arrival , I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial . 
I saw his name on the card . '' 
`` What name ? '' 
`` Marius Pontmercy . '' 
`` The wicked fellow ! '' 
exclaimed his aunt . 
`` Ah ! 
your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself . 
To think that he is to pass the night in a diligence ! '' 
`` Just as I am going to do . '' 
`` But you -- it is your duty ; in his case , it is wildness . '' 
`` Bosh ! '' 
said Theodule . 
Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder , -- an idea struck her . 
If she had been a man , she would have slapped her brow . 
She apostrophized Theodule : -- `` Are you aware whether your cousin knows you ? '' 
`` No . 
I have seen him ; but he has never deigned to notice me . '' 
`` So you are going to travel together ? '' 
`` He in the imperial , I in the coupe . '' 
`` Where does this diligence run ? '' 
`` To Andelys . '' 
`` Then that is where Marius is going ? '' 
`` Unless , like myself , he should stop on the way . 
I get down at Vernon , in order to take the branch coach for Gaillon . 
I know nothing of Marius ' plan of travel . '' 
`` Marius ! 
what an ugly name ! 
what possessed them to name him Marius ? 
While you , at least , are called Theodule . '' 
`` I would rather be called Alfred , '' said the officer . 
`` Listen , Theodule . '' 
`` I am listening , aunt . '' 
`` Pay attention . '' 
`` I am paying attention . '' 
`` You understand ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , Marius absents himself ! '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
`` He travels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
`` He spends the night out . '' 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
`` We should like to know what there is behind all this . '' 
Theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze : -- `` Some petticoat or other . '' 
And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty , he added : -- `` A lass . '' 
`` That is evident , '' exclaimed his aunt , who thought she heard M. Gillenormand speaking , and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette , accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew . 
She resumed : -- `` Do us a favor . 
Follow Marius a little . 
He does not know you , it will be easy . 
Since a lass there is , try to get a sight of her . 
You must write us the tale . 
It will amuse his grandfather . '' 
Theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying ; but he was much touched by the ten louis , and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel . 
He accepted the commission and said : `` As you please , aunt . '' 
And he added in an aside , to himself : `` Here I am a duenna . '' 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him . 
`` You are not the man to play such pranks , Theodule . 
You obey discipline , you are the slave of orders , you are a man of scruples and duty , and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature . '' 
The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for his probity . 
Marius , on the evening following this dialogue , mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched . 
As for the watcher , the first thing he did was to fall asleep . 
His slumber was complete and conscientious . 
Argus snored all night long . 
At daybreak , the conductor of the diligence shouted : `` Vernon ! 
relay of Vernon ! 
Travellers for Vernon ! '' 
And Lieutenant Theodule woke . 
`` Good , '' he growled , still half asleep , `` this is where I get out . '' 
Then , as his memory cleared by degrees , the effect of waking , he recalled his aunt , the ten louis , and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius . 
This set him to laughing . 
`` Perhaps he is no longer in the coach , '' he thought , as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform . 
`` He may have stopped at Poissy ; he may have stopped at Triel ; if he did not get out at Meulan , he may have got out at Mantes , unless he got out at Rolleboise , or if he did not go on as far as Pacy , with the choice of turning to the left at Evreus , or to the right at Laroche-Guyon . 
Run after him , aunty . 
What the devil am I to write to that good old soul ? '' 
At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial , made its appearance at the window of the coupe . 
`` Can that be Marius ? '' 
said the lieutenant . 
It was Marius . 
A little peasant girl , all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle , was offering flowers to the travellers . 
`` Give your ladies flowers ! '' 
she cried . 
Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket . 
`` Come now , '' said Theodule , leaping down from the coupe , `` this piques my curiosity . 
Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to ? 
She must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet . 
I want to see her . '' 
And no longer in pursuance of orders , but from personal curiosity , like dogs who hunt on their own account , he set out to follow Marius . 
Marius paid no attention to Theodule . 
Elegant women descended from the diligence ; he did not glance at them . 
He seemed to see nothing around him . 
`` He is pretty deeply in love ! '' 
thought Theodule . 
Marius directed his steps towards the church . 
`` Capital , '' said Theodule to himself . 
`` Rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort . 
Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good God 's head . '' 
On arriving at the church , Marius did not enter it , but skirted the apse . 
He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse .
