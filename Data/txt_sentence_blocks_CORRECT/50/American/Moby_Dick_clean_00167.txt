come to help ; eh , Pip ? '' 
`` Pip ? 
whom call ye Pip ? 
Pip jumped from the whaleboat . 
Pip 's missing . 
Let 's see now if ye have n't fished him up here , fisherman . 
It drags hard ; I guess he 's holding on . 
Jerk him , Tahiti ! 
Jerk him off we haul in no cowards here . 
Ho ! 
there 's his arm just breaking water . 
A hatchet ! 
a hatchet ! 
cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here . 
Captain Ahab ! 
sir , sir ! 
here 's Pip , trying to get on board again . '' 
`` Peace , thou crazy loon , '' cried the Manxman , seizing him by the arm . 
`` Away from the quarter-deck ! '' 
`` The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser , '' muttered Ahab , advancing . 
`` Hands off from that holiness ! 
Where sayest thou Pip was , boy ? 
`` Astern there , sir , astern ! 
Lo ! 
lo ! '' 
`` And who art thou , boy ? 
I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes . 
Oh God ! 
that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through ! 
Who art thou , boy ? '' 
`` Bell-boy , sir ; ship 's - crier ; ding , dong , ding ! 
Pip ! 
Pip ! 
Pip ! 
One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip ; five feet high -- looks cowardly -- quickest known by that ! 
Ding , dong , ding ! 
Who 's seen Pip the coward ? '' 
`` There can be no hearts above the snow-line . 
Oh , ye frozen heavens ! 
look down here . 
Ye did beget this luckless child , and have abandoned him , ye creative libertines . 
Here , boy ; Ahab 's cabin shall be Pip 's home henceforth , while Ahab lives . 
Thou touchest my inmost centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings . 
Come , let 's down . '' 
`` What 's this ? 
here 's velvet shark-skin , '' intently gazing at Ahab 's hand , and feeling it . 
`` Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne'er been lost ! 
This seems to me , sir , as a man-rope ; something that weak souls may hold by . 
Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go . '' 
`` Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here .
