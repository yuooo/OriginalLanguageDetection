`` Here ! 
Six yards in front of you . '' 
`` Oh , come ! 
I ai n't blind . 
You 'll be telling me next you 're just thin air . 
I 'm not one of your ignorant tramps -- '' `` Yes , I am -- thin air . 
You 're looking through me . '' 
`` What ! 
Ai n't there any stuff to you . 
Vox et -- what is it ? 
-- jabber . 
Is it that ? '' 
`` I am just a human being -- solid , needing food and drink , needing covering too -- But I 'm invisible . 
You see ? 
Invisible . 
Simple idea . 
Invisible . '' 
`` What , real like ? '' 
`` Yes , real . '' 
`` Let 's have a hand of you , '' said Marvel , `` if you are real . 
It wo n't be so darn out-of-the-way like , then -- Lord ! '' 
he said , `` how you made me jump ! 
-- gripping me like that ! '' 
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers , and his fingers went timorously up the arm , patted a muscular chest , and explored a bearded face . 
Marvel 's face was astonishment . 
`` I 'm dashed ! '' 
he said . 
`` If this do n't beat cock-fighting ! 
Most remarkable ! 
-- And there I can see a rabbit clean through you , ` arf a mile away ! 
Not a bit of you visible -- except -- '' He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly . 
`` You ` ave n't been eatin ' bread and cheese ? '' 
he asked , holding the invisible arm . 
`` You 're quite right , and it 's not quite assimilated into the system . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Sort of ghostly , though . '' 
`` Of course , all this is n't half so wonderful as you think . '' 
`` It 's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Howjer manage it ! 
How the dooce is it done ? '' 
`` It 's too long a story . 
And besides -- '' `` I tell you , the whole business fairly beats me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` What I want to say at present is this : I need help . 
I have come to that -- I came upon you suddenly . 
I was wandering , mad with rage , naked , impotent . 
I could have murdered . 
And I saw you -- '' `` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I came up behind you -- hesitated -- went on -- '' Mr. Marvel 's expression was eloquent . ''
