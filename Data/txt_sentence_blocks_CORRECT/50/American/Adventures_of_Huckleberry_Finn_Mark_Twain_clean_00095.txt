It was a dreadful thing to see . 
Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another . 
We see we was too late -- could n't do no good . 
We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them . 
So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing . 
But that 's always the way ; it do n't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person 's conscience ai n't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway . 
If I had a yaller dog that did n't know no more than a person 's conscience does I would pison him . 
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person 's insides , and yet ai n't no good , nohow . 
Tom Sawyer he says the same . 
WE stopped talking , and got to thinking . 
By and by Tom says : `` Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before ! 
I bet I know where Jim is . '' 
`` No ! 
Where ? '' 
`` In that hut down by the ash-hopper . 
Why , looky here . 
When we was at dinner , did n't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What did you think the vittles was for ? '' 
`` For a dog . '' 
`` So 'd I. Well , it was n't for a dog . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because part of it was watermelon . '' 
`` So it was -- I noticed it . 
Well , it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon . 
It shows how a body can see and do n't see at the same time . '' 
`` Well , the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in , and he locked it again when he came out . 
He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table -- same key , I bet . 
Watermelon shows man , lock shows prisoner ; and it ai n't likely there 's two prisoners on such a little plantation , and where the people 's all so kind and good . 
Jim 's the prisoner . 
All right -- I 'm glad we found it out detective fashion ; I would n't give shucks for any other way . 
Now you work your mind , and study out a plan to steal Jim , and I will study out one , too ; and we 'll take the one we like the best . '' 
What a head for just a boy to have ! 
If I had Tom Sawyer 's head I would n't trade it off to be a duke , nor mate of a steamboat , nor clown in a circus , nor nothing I can think of . 
I went to thinking out a plan , but only just to be doing something ; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from . 
Pretty soon Tom says : `` Ready ? '' 
`` Yes , '' I says . 
`` All right -- bring it out . '' 
`` My plan is this , '' I says . 
`` We can easy find out if it 's Jim in there . 
Then get up my canoe to-morrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island . 
Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man 's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and Jim used to do before . 
Would n't that plan work ? '' 
`` WORK ? 
Why , cert ` nly it would work , like rats a-fighting . 
But it 's too blame ' simple ; there ai n't nothing TO it . 
What 's the good of a plan that ai n't no more trouble than that ? 
It 's as mild as goose-milk . 
Why , Huck , it would n't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory . '' 
I never said nothing , because I war n't expecting nothing different ; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it would n't have none of them objections to it .
