So , so , so , then : -- softly , softly ! 
That 's it -- that 's it ! 
long and strong . 
Give way there , give way ! 
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep . 
Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull . 
Pull , will ye ? 
pull , ca n't ye ? 
pull , wo n't ye ? 
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes do n't ye pull ? 
-- pull and break something ! 
pull , and start your eyes out ! 
Here , '' whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; `` every mother 's son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth . 
That 's it -- that 's it . 
Now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel-bits . 
Start her -- start her , my silverspoons ! 
Start her , marling-spikes ! '' 
Stubb 's exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing . 
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation . 
Not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . 
He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing . 
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering-oar , and so broadly gaped -- open-mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew . 
Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them . 
In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb 's bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate . 
`` Mr. Starbuck ! 
larboard boat there , ahoy ! 
a word with ye , sir , if ye please ! '' 
`` Halloa ! '' 
returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb 's . 
`` What think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! 
`` Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . 
-LRB- Strong , strong , boys ! -RRB- '' 
in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : `` A sad business , Mr. Stubb ! 
-LRB- seethe her , seethe her , my lads ! -RRB- 
but never mind , Mr. Stubb , all for the best . 
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will . 
-LRB- Spring , my men , spring ! -RRB- 
There 's hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr. Stubb , and that 's what ye came for . 
-LRB- Pull , my boys ! -RRB- 
Sperm , sperm 's the play ! 
This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand . '' 
`` Aye , aye , I thought as much , '' soliloquized Stubb , when the boats diverged , `` as soon as I clapt eye on 'em , I thought so . 
Aye , and that 's what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough-Boy long suspected . 
They were hidden down there . 
The White Whale 's at the bottom of it . 
Well , well , so be it ! 
Ca n't be helped ! 
All right ! 
Give way men ! 
It ai n't the White Whale to-day !
