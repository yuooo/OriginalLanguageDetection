She 's down at the station . 
Hysterics . 
He 's close here . 
What was it about ? '' 
Kemp swore . 
`` What a fool I was , '' said Kemp . 
`` I might have known . 
It 's not an hour 's walk from Hintondean . 
Already ? '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
said Adye . 
`` Look here ! '' 
said Kemp , and led the way into his study . 
He handed Adye the Invisible Man 's letter . 
Adye read it and whistled softly . 
`` And you -- ? '' 
said Adye . 
`` Proposed a trap -- like a fool , '' said Kemp , `` and sent my proposal out by a maid servant . 
To him . '' 
Adye followed Kemp 's profanity . 
`` He 'll clear out , '' said Adye . 
`` Not he , '' said Kemp . 
A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs . 
Adye had a silvery glimpse of a little revolver half out of Kemp 's pocket . 
`` It 's a window , upstairs ! '' 
said Kemp , and led the way up . 
There came a second smash while they were still on the staircase . 
When they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed , half the room littered with splintered glass , and one big flint lying on the writing table . 
The two men stopped in the doorway , contemplating the wreckage . 
Kemp swore again , and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol , hung starred for a moment , and collapsed in jagged , shivering triangles into the room . 
`` What 's this for ? '' 
said Adye . 
`` It 's a beginning , '' said Kemp . 
`` There 's no way of climbing up here ? '' 
`` Not for a cat , '' said Kemp . 
`` No shutters ? '' 
`` Not here . 
All the downstairs rooms -- Hullo ! '' 
Smash , and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs . 
`` Confound him ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` That must be -- yes -- it 's one of the bedrooms . 
He 's going to do all the house . 
But he 's a fool . 
The shutters are up , and the glass will fall outside . 
He 'll cut his feet . '' 
Another window proclaimed its destruction . 
The two men stood on the landing perplexed . 
`` I have it ! '' 
said Adye .
