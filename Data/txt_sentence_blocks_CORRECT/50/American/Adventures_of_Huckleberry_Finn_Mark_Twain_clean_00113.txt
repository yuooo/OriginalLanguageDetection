`` I hai n't been nowheres , '' I says , `` only just hunting for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid . '' 
`` Why , where ever did you go ? '' 
he says . 
`` Your aunt 's been mighty uneasy . '' 
`` She need n't , '' I says , `` because we was all right . 
We followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but could n't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along up - shore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and Sid 's at the post-office to see what he can hear , and I 'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us , and then we 're going home . '' 
So then we went to the post-office to get `` Sid '' ; but just as I suspicioned , he war n't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but Sid did n't come ; so the old man said , come along , let Sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling around -- but we would ride . 
I could n't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid ; and he said there war n't no use in it , and I must come along , and let Aunt Sally see we was all right . 
When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that do n't amount to shucks , and said she 'd serve Sid the same when he come . 
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers ' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard . 
Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was a-going all the time . 
She says : `` Well , Sister Phelps , I 've ransacked that-air cabin over , an ' I b ` lieve the nigger was crazy . 
I says to Sister Damrell -- did n't I , Sister Damrell ? 
-- s ` I , he 's crazy , s ` I -- them 's the very words I said . 
You all hearn me : he 's crazy , s ` I ; everything shows it , s ` I. Look at that-air grindstone , s ` I ; want to tell ME ' t any cretur ` t 's in his right mind 's a goin ' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone , s ` I ? 
Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart ; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year , 'n' all that -- natcherl son o ' Louis somebody , 'n' sich everlast 'n rubbage . 
He 's plumb crazy , s ` I ; it 's what I says in the fust place , it 's what I says in the middle , 'n' it 's what I says last 'n' all the time -- the nigger 's crazy -- crazy 's Nebokoodneezer , s ` I. '' `` An ' look at that-air ladder made out 'n rags , Sister Hotchkiss , '' says old Mrs. Damrell ; `` what in the name o ' goodness COULD he ever want of -- '' `` The very words I was a-sayin ' no longer ago th 'n this minute to Sister Utterback , 'n' she 'll tell you so herself . 
Sh-she , look at that-air rag ladder , sh-she ; 'n' s ` I , yes , LOOK at it , s ` I -- what COULD he a-wanted of it , s ` I. Sh-she , Sister Hotchkiss , sh-she -- '' `` But how in the nation 'd they ever GIT that grindstone IN there , ANYWAY ? 
'n' who dug that-air HOLE ? 
'n' who -- '' `` My very WORDS , Brer Penrod ! 
I was a-sayin ' -- pass that-air sasser o ' m ` lasses , wo n't ye ? 
-- I was a-sayin ' to Sister Dunlap , jist this minute , how DID they git that grindstone in there , s ` I. Without HELP , mind you -- ` thout HELP ! 
THAT 'S wher 't is . 
Do n't tell ME , s ` I ; there WUZ help , s ` I ; 'n' ther ' wuz a PLENTY help , too , s ` I ; ther 's ben a DOZEN a-helpin ' that nigger , 'n' I lay I 'd skin every last nigger on this place but I 'D find out who done it , s ` I ; 'n' moreover , s ` I -- '' `` A DOZEN says you ! 
-- FORTY could n't a done every thing that 's been done . 
Look at them case-knife saws and things , how tedious they 've been made ; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm , a week 's work for six men ; look at that nigger made out 'n straw on the bed ; and look at -- '' `` You may WELL say it , Brer Hightower ! 
It 's jist as I was a-sayin ' to Brer Phelps , his own self . 
S ` e , what do YOU think of it , Sister Hotchkiss , s ` e ? 
Think o ' what , Brer Phelps , s ` I ? 
Think o ' that bed-leg sawed off that a way , s ` e ? 
THINK of it , s ` I ? 
I lay it never sawed ITSELF off , s ` I -- somebody SAWED it , s ` I ; that 's my opinion , take it or leave it , it may n't be no ` count , s ` I , but sich as ' t is , it 's my opinion , s ` I , 'n' if any body k 'n start a better one , s ` I , let him DO it , s ` I , that 's all . 
I says to Sister Dunlap , s ` I -- '' `` Why , dog my cats , they must a ben a house-full o ' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work , Sister Phelps . 
Look at that shirt -- every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ 'n done with blood ! 
Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along , all the time , amost . 
Why , I 'd give two dollars to have it read to me ; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it , I ` low I 'd take 'n' lash 'm t 'll -- '' `` People to HELP him , Brother Marples ! 
Well , I reckon you 'd THINK so if you 'd a been in this house for a while back . 
Why , they 've stole everything they could lay their hands on -- and we a-watching all the time , mind you . 
They stole that shirt right off o ' the line ! 
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of , ther ' ai n't no telling how many times they DID N'T steal that ; and flour , and candles , and candlesticks , and spoons , and the old warming-pan , and most a thousand things that I disremember now , and my new calico dress ; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day AND night , as I was a-telling you , and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ; and here at the last minute , lo and behold you , they slides right in under our noses and fools us , and not only fools US but the Injun Territory robbers too , and actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe and sound , and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time ! 
I tell you , it just bangs anything I ever HEARD of . 
Why , SPERITS could n't a done better and been no smarter . 
And I reckon they must a BEEN sperits -- because , YOU know our dogs , and ther ' ai n't no better ; well , them dogs never even got on the TRACK of 'm once ! 
You explain THAT to me if you can ! 
-- ANY of you ! '' 
`` Well , it does beat -- '' `` Laws alive , I never -- '' `` So help me , I would n't a be -- '' `` HOUSE-thieves as well as -- '' `` Goodnessgracioussakes , I 'd a ben afeard to live in sich a -- '' '' ` Fraid to LIVE ! 
-- why , I was that scared I das n't hardly go to bed , or get up , or lay down , or SET down , Sister Ridgeway . 
Why , they 'd steal the very -- why , goodness sakes , you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night . 
I hope to gracious if I war n't afraid they 'd steal some o ' the family ! 
I was just to that pass I did n't have no reasoning faculties no more .
