`` I reckon we 'll go and see for ourselves . '' 
`` I wish you would , '' says I , `` because it 's pap that 's there , and maybe you 'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is . 
He 's sick -- and so is mam and Mary Ann . '' 
`` Oh , the devil ! 
we 're in a hurry , boy . 
But I s ` pose we 've got to . 
Come , buckle to your paddle , and let 's get along . '' 
I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars . 
When we had made a stroke or two , I says : `` Pap 'll be mighty much obleeged to you , I can tell you . 
Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and I ca n't do it by myself . '' 
`` Well , that 's infernal mean . 
Odd , too . 
Say , boy , what 's the matter with your father ? '' 
`` It 's the -- a -- the -- well , it ai n't anything much . '' 
They stopped pulling . 
It war n't but a mighty little ways to the raft now . 
One says : `` Boy , that 's a lie . 
What IS the matter with your pap ? 
Answer up square now , and it 'll be the better for you . '' 
`` I will , sir , I will , honest -- but do n't leave us , please . 
It 's the -- the -- Gentlemen , if you 'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the headline , you wo n't have to come a-near the raft -- please do . '' 
`` Set her back , John , set her back ! '' 
says one . 
They backed water . 
`` Keep away , boy -- keep to looard . 
Confound it , I just expect the wind has blowed it to us . 
Your pap 's got the small-pox , and you know it precious well . 
Why did n't you come out and say so ? 
Do you want to spread it all over ? '' 
`` Well , '' says I , a-blubbering , `` I 've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us . '' 
`` Poor devil , there 's something in that . 
We are right down sorry for you , but we -- well , hang it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see . 
Look here , I 'll tell you what to do . 
Do n't you try to land by yourself , or you 'll smash everything to pieces . 
You float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river . 
It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever . 
Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter . 
Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy . 
It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard . 
Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he 's in pretty hard luck . 
Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by . 
I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom ! 
it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? '' 
`` Hold on , Parker , '' says the other man , `` here 's a twenty to put on the board for me . 
Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you 'll be all right . '' 
`` That 's so , my boy -- good-bye , good-bye . 
If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it . '' 
`` Good-bye , sir , '' says I ; `` I wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it . '' 
They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get STARTED right when he 's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat . 
Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s ` pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
