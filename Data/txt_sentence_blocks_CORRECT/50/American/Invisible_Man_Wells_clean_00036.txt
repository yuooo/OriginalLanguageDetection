asked the man with the black beard , with one hand behind him . 
`` I guess it 's about time we saw him . '' 
The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in , and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street . 
The policeman had been standing on the settee staring out , craning to see who was at the door . 
He got down with raised eyebrows . 
`` It 's that , '' he said . 
The barman stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr. Marvel , stared at the smashed window , and came round to the two other men . 
Everything was suddenly quiet . 
`` I wish I had my truncheon , '' said the policeman , going irresolutely to the door . 
`` Once we open , in he comes . 
There 's no stopping him . '' 
`` Do n't you be in too much hurry about that door , '' said the anaemic cabman , anxiously . 
`` Draw the bolts , '' said the man with the black beard , `` and if he comes -- '' He showed a revolver in his hand . 
`` That wo n't do , '' said the policeman ; `` that 's murder . '' 
`` I know what country I 'm in , '' said the man with the beard . 
`` I 'm going to let off at his legs . 
Draw the bolts . '' 
`` Not with that blinking thing going off behind me , '' said the barman , craning over the blind . 
`` Very well , '' said the man with the black beard , and stooping down , revolver ready , drew them himself . 
Barman , cabman , and policeman faced about . 
`` Come in , '' said the bearded man in an undertone , standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him . 
No one came in , the door remained closed . 
Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously , they were still waiting , and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information . 
`` Are all the doors of the house shut ? '' 
asked Marvel . 
`` He 's going round -- prowling round . 
He 's as artful as the devil . '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
said the burly barman . 
`` There 's the back ! 
Just watch them doors ! 
I say -- ! '' 
He looked about him helplessly . 
The bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn . 
`` There 's the yard door and the private door . 
The yard door -- '' He rushed out of the bar . 
In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand . 
`` The yard door was open ! '' 
he said , and his fat underlip dropped . 
`` He may be in the house now ! '' 
said the first cabman . 
`` He 's not in the kitchen , '' said the barman . 
`` There 's two women there , and I 've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer . 
And they do n't think he 's come in . 
They have n't noticed -- '' `` Have you fastened it ? '' 
asked the first cabman . 
`` I 'm out of frocks , '' said the barman . 
The man with the beard replaced his revolver . 
And even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked , and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open . 
They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret , and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue .
