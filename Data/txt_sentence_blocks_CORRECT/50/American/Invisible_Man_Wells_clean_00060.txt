This brought him back , more sinister than ever . 
That time he actually touched me , jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room . 
`` Presently he calmed a little . 
` Rats , ' he said in an undertone , fingers on lips . 
He was evidently a little scared . 
I edged quietly out of the room , but a plank creaked . 
Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house , revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys . 
When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage -- I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity . 
By this time I knew he was alone in the house , and so I made no more ado , but knocked him on the head . '' 
`` Knocked him on the head ? '' 
exclaimed Kemp . 
`` Yes -- stunned him -- as he was going downstairs . 
Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing . 
He went downstairs like a bag of old boots . '' 
`` But -- I say ! 
The common conventions of humanity -- '' `` Are all very well for common people . 
But the point was , Kemp , that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me . 
I could n't think of any other way of doing it . 
And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet . '' 
`` Tied him up in a sheet ! '' 
`` Made a sort of bag of it . 
It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet , and a devilish hard thing to get out of -- head away from the string . 
My dear Kemp , it 's no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer . 
It had to be done . 
He had his revolver . 
If once he saw me he would be able to describe me -- '' `` But still , '' said Kemp , `` in England -- to-day . 
And the man was in his own house , and you were -- well , robbing . '' 
`` Robbing ! 
Confound it ! 
You 'll call me a thief next ! 
Surely , Kemp , you 're not fool enough to dance on the old strings . 
Ca n't you see my position ? '' 
`` And his too , '' said Kemp . 
The Invisible Man stood up sharply . 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
Kemp 's face grew a trifle hard . 
He was about to speak and checked himself . 
`` I suppose , after all , '' he said with a sudden change of manner , `` the thing had to be done . 
You were in a fix . 
But still -- '' `` Of course I was in a fix -- an infernal fix . 
And he made me wild too -- hunting me about the house , fooling about with his revolver , locking and unlocking doors . 
He was simply exasperating . 
You do n't blame me , do you ? 
You do n't blame me ? '' 
`` I never blame anyone , '' said Kemp . 
`` It 's quite out of fashion . 
What did you do next ? '' 
`` I was hungry . 
Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese -- more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger . 
I took some brandy and water , and then went up past my impromptu bag -- he was lying quite still -- to the room containing the old clothes .
