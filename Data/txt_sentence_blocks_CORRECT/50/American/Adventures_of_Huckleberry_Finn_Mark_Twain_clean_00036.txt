`` Well , now , I be ding-busted ! 
How do dat come ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; but it 's so . 
I got some of their jabber out of a book . 
S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy -- what would you think ? '' 
`` I wouldn ' think nuff ` n ; I 'd take en bust him over de head -- dat is , if he war n't white . 
I would n't ` low no nigger to call me dat . '' 
`` Shucks , it ai n't calling you anything . 
It 's only saying , do you know how to talk French ? '' 
`` Well , den , why could n't he SAY it ? '' 
`` Why , he IS a-saying it .

`` Well , it 's a blame ridicklous way , en I doan ' want to hear no mo ' ` bout it . 
Dey ain ' no sense in it . '' 
`` Looky here , Jim ; does a cat talk like we do ? '' 
`` No , a cat do n't . '' 
`` Well , does a cow ? '' 
`` No , a cow do n't , nuther . '' 
`` Does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ? '' 
`` No , dey do n't . '' 
`` It 's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ai n't it ? '' 
`` Course . ''

`` WELL , den ! 
Dad blame it , why doan ' he TALK like a man ? 
You answer me DAT ! '' 
I see it war n't no use wasting words -- you ca n't learn a nigger to argue . 
So I quit . 
WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo , at the bottom of Illinois , where the Ohio River comes in , and that was what we was after . 
We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States , and then be out of trouble . 
Well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to . 
I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went . 
I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards . 
I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke . 
But she did n't come . 
I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her . 
I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them . 
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
