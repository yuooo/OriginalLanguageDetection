`` Well , then , what are they FOR ? '' 
`` Why , they 're for STYLE . 
Do n't you know nothing ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't WANT to know no such foolishness as that . 
How is servants treated in England ? 
Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers ? '' 
`` NO ! 
A servant ai n't nobody there . 
They treat them worse than dogs . '' 
`` Do n't they give 'em holidays , the way we do , Christmas and New Year 's week , and Fourth of July ? '' 
`` Oh , just listen ! 
A body could tell YOU hai n't ever been to England by that . 
Why , Hare-l -- why , Joanna , they never see a holiday from year 's end to year 's end ; never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres . '' 
`` Nor church ? '' 
`` Nor church . '' 
`` But YOU always went to church . '' 
Well , I was gone up again . 
I forgot I was the old man 's servant . 
But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and HAD to go to church whether he wanted to or not , and set with the family , on account of its being the law . 
But I did n't do it pretty good , and when I got done I see she war n't satisfied . 
She says : `` Honest injun , now , hai n't you been telling me a lot of lies ? '' 
`` Honest injun , '' says I. `` None of it at all ? '' 
`` None of it at all . 
Not a lie in it , '' says I. `` Lay your hand on this book and say it . '' 
I see it war n't nothing but a dictionary , so I laid my hand on it and said it . 
So then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : `` Well , then , I 'll believe some of it ; but I hope to gracious if I 'll believe the rest . '' 
`` What is it you wo n't believe , Joe ? '' 
says Mary Jane , stepping in with Susan behind her . 
`` It ai n't right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people . 
How would you like to be treated so ? '' 
`` That 's always your way , Maim -- always sailing in to help somebody before they 're hurt . 
I hai n't done nothing to him . 
He 's told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I would n't swallow it all ; and that 's every bit and grain I DID say . 
I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , ca n't he ? '' 
`` I do n't care whether 't was little or whether 't was big ; he 's here in our house and a stranger , and it was n't good of you to say it . 
If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you ought n't to say a thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed . '' 
`` Why , Maim , he said -- '' `` It do n't make no difference what he SAID -- that ai n't the thing . 
The thing is for you to treat him KIND , and not be saying things to make him remember he ai n't in his own country and amongst his own folks . '' 
I says to myself , THIS is a girl that I 'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money ! 
Then Susan SHE waltzed in ; and if you 'll believe me , she did give Hare - lip hark from the tomb ! 
Says I to myself , and this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money ! 
Then Mary Jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely again -- which was her way ; but when she got done there war n't hardly anything left o ' poor Hare-lip . 
So she hollered . 
`` All right , then , '' says the other girls ; `` you just ask his pardon . '' 
She done it , too ; and she done it beautiful . 
She done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again . 
I says to myself , this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money . 
And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends . 
I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself , my mind 's made up ; I 'll hive that money for them or bust . 
So then I lit out -- for bed , I said , meaning some time or another .
