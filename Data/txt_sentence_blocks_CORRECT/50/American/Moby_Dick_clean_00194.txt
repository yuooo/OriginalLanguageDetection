`` The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale , amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles .

`` Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks , the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over ; he rears his enormous head , and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him ; he rushes at the boats with his head ; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness , and sometimes utterly destroyed . 
... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting , and , in a commercial point of view , so important an animal -LRB- as the Sperm Whale -RRB- should have been so entirely neglected , or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous , and many of them competent observers , that of late years , must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes .
