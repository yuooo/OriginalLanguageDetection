here 's some of what I take to be Greek ! 
Greek letters certainly . '' 
He pointed to the middle of the page . 
Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and brought his face nearer , apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses . 
Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck . 
He tried to raise his head , and encountered an immovable resistance . 
The feeling was a curious pressure , the grip of a heavy , firm hand , and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table . 
`` Do n't move , little men , '' whispered a voice , `` or I 'll brain you both ! '' 
He looked into the face of Cuss , close to his own , and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment . 
`` I 'm sorry to handle you so roughly , '' said the Voice , `` but it 's unavoidable . '' 
`` Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator 's private memoranda , '' said the Voice ; and two chins struck the table simultaneously , and two sets of teeth rattled . 
`` Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune ? '' 
and the concussion was repeated . 
`` Where have they put my clothes ? '' 
`` Listen , '' said the Voice . 
`` The windows are fastened and I 've taken the key out of the door . 
I am a fairly strong man , and I have the poker handy -- besides being invisible . 
There 's not the slightest doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to -- do you understand ? 
Very well . 
If I let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what I tell you ? '' 
The vicar and the doctor looked at one another , and the doctor pulled a face . 
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Bunting , and the doctor repeated it . 
Then the pressure on the necks relaxed , and the doctor and the vicar sat up , both very red in the face and wriggling their heads . 
`` Please keep sitting where you are , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Here 's the poker , you see . '' 
`` When I came into this room , '' continued the Invisible Man , after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors , `` I did not expect to find it occupied , and I expected to find , in addition to my books of memoranda , an outfit of clothing . 
Where is it ? 
No -- do n't rise . 
I can see it 's gone . 
Now , just at present , though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark , the evenings are quite chilly . 
I want clothing -- and other accommodation ; and I must also have those three books . '' 
THE INVISIBLE MAN LOSES HIS TEMPER It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again , for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent . 
While these things were going on in the parlour , and while Mr. Huxter was watching Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate , not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic . 
Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour , a sharp cry , and then -- silence . 
`` Hul-lo ! '' 
said Teddy Henfrey . 
`` Hul-lo ! '' 
from the Tap . 
Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely . 
`` That ai n't right , '' he said , and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door . 
He and Teddy approached the door together , with intent faces . 
Their eyes considered . 
`` Summat wrong , '' said Hall , and Henfrey nodded agreement . 
Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them , and there was a muffled sound of conversation , very rapid and subdued . 
`` You all right thur ? '' 
asked Hall , rapping . 
The muttered conversation ceased abruptly , for a moment silence , then the conversation was resumed , in hissing whispers , then a sharp cry of `` No ! 
no , you do n't ! '' 
There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair , a brief struggle . 
Silence again .
