The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning . 
`` Have you a bandage on ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Kemp , and then roused himself . 
`` I say ! '' 
he said . 
`` But this is nonsense . 
It 's some trick . '' 
He stepped forward suddenly , and his hand , extended towards the bandage , met invisible fingers . 
He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed . 
`` Keep steady , Kemp , for God 's sake ! 
I want help badly . 
Stop ! '' 
The hand gripped his arm . 
He struck at it . 
`` Kemp ! '' 
cried the Voice . 
`` Kemp ! 
Keep steady ! '' 
and the grip tightened . 
A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp . 
The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder , and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed . 
He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth . 
The Invisible Man had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely . 
`` Listen to reason , will you ? '' 
said the Invisible Man , sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs . 
`` By Heaven ! 
you 'll madden me in a minute ! 
`` Lie still , you fool ! '' 
bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp 's ear . 
Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still . 
`` If you shout , I 'll smash your face , '' said the Invisible Man , relieving his mouth . 
`` I 'm an Invisible Man . 
It 's no foolishness , and no magic . 
I really am an Invisible Man . 
And I want your help . 
I do n't want to hurt you , but if you behave like a frantic rustic , I must . 
Do n't you remember me , Kemp ? 
Griffin , of University College ? '' 
`` Let me get up , '' said Kemp . 
`` I 'll stop where I am . 
And let me sit quiet for a minute . '' 
He sat up and felt his neck . 
`` I am Griffin , of University College , and I have made myself invisible . 
I am just an ordinary man -- a man you have known -- made invisible . '' 
`` Griffin ? '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Griffin , '' answered the Voice .
