`` What , all that time ? '' 
`` Yes -- indeedy . '' 
`` And ai n't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat ? '' 
`` No , sah -- nuffn else . '' 
`` Well , you must be most starved , ai n't you ? '' 
`` I reck 'n I could eat a hoss . 
I think I could . 
How long you ben on de islan ' ? '' 
`` Since the night I got killed . '' 
`` No ! 
W ` y , what has you lived on ? 
But you got a gun . 
Oh , yes , you got a gun . 
Dat 's good . 
Now you kill sumfn en I 'll make up de fire . '' 
So we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , I fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and coffee-pot and frying-pan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft . 
I catched a good big catfish , too , and Jim cleaned him with his knife , and fried him . 
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot . 
Jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved . 
Then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied . 
By and by Jim says : `` But looky here , Huck , who wuz it dat ` uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you ? '' 
Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart . 
He said Tom Sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what I had . 
Then I says : `` How do you come to be here , Jim , and how 'd you get here ? '' 
He looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute . 
Then he says : `` Maybe I better not tell . '' 
`` Why , Jim ? '' 
`` Well , dey 's reasons . 
But you wouldn ' tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck ? '' 
`` Blamed if I would , Jim . '' 
`` Well , I b ` lieve you , Huck . 
I -- I RUN OFF . '' 
`` Jim ! '' 
`` But mind , you said you wouldn ' tell -- you know you said you wouldn ' tell , Huck . '' 
`` Well , I did . 
I said I would n't , and I 'll stick to it . 
Honest INJUN , I will . 
People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum -- but that do n't make no difference . 
I ai n't a-going to tell , and I ai n't a-going back there , anyways . 
So , now , le 's know all about it . '' 
`` Well , you see , it ` uz dis way . 
Ole missus -- dat 's Miss Watson -- she pecks on me all de time , en treats me pooty rough , but she awluz said she wouldn ' sell me down to Orleans . 
But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun ' de place considable lately , en I begin to git oneasy . 
Well , one night I creeps to de do ' pooty late , en de do ' war n't quite shet , en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans , but she didn ' want to , but she could git eight hund 'd dollars for me , en it ` uz sich a big stack o ' money she couldn ' resis ' . 
De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn ' do it , but I never waited to hear de res ' . 
I lit out mighty quick , I tell you . 
`` I tuck out en shin down de hill , en ` spec to steal a skift ` long de sho ' som ` ers ` bove de town , but dey wuz people a-stirring yit , so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ` way . 
Well , I wuz dah all night .

` Long ` bout six in de mawnin ' skifts begin to go by , en ` bout eight er nine every skift dat went ` long wuz talkin ' ` bout how yo ' pap come over to de town en say you 's killed .
