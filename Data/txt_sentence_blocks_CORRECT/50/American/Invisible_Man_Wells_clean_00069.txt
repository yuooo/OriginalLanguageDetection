The letter will fall in as the postman comes along , then off ! 
The game begins . 
Death starts . 
Help him not , my people , lest Death fall upon you also . 
To-day Kemp is to die . '' 
Kemp read this letter twice , `` It 's no hoax , '' he said . 
`` That 's his voice ! 
And he means it . '' 
He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark Hintondean , and the prosaic detail `` 2d . 
to pay . '' 
He got up slowly , leaving his lunch unfinished -- the letter had come by the one o'clock post -- and went into his study . 
He rang for his housekeeper , and told her to go round the house at once , examine all the fastenings of the windows , and close all the shutters . 
He closed the shutters of his study himself . 
From a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver , examined it carefully , and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket . 
He wrote a number of brief notes , one to Colonel Adye , gave them to his servant to take , with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house . 
`` There is no danger , '' he said , and added a mental reservation , `` to you . '' 
He remained meditative for a space after doing this , and then returned to his cooling lunch . 
He ate with gaps of thought . 
Finally he struck the table sharply . 
`` We will have him ! '' 
he said ; `` and I am the bait . 
He will come too far . '' 
He went up to the belvedere , carefully shutting every door after him . 
`` It 's a game , '' he said , `` an odd game -- but the chances are all for me , Mr. Griffin , in spite of your invisibility . 
Griffin contra mundum ... with a vengeance . '' 
He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside . 
`` He must get food every day -- and I do n't envy him . 
Did he really sleep last night ? 
Out in the open somewhere -- secure from collisions . 
I wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat . 
`` He may be watching me now . '' 
He went close to the window . 
Something rapped smartly against the brickwork over the frame , and made him start violently back . 
`` I 'm getting nervous , '' said Kemp . 
But it was five minutes before he went to the window again . 
`` It must have been a sparrow , '' he said . 
Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing , and hurried downstairs . 
He unbolted and unlocked the door , examined the chain , put it up , and opened cautiously without showing himself . 
A familiar voice hailed him . 
It was Adye . 
`` Your servant 's been assaulted , Kemp , '' he said round the door . 
`` What ! '' 
exclaimed Kemp . 
`` Had that note of yours taken away from her . 
He 's close about here . 
Let me in . '' 
Kemp released the chain , and Adye entered through as narrow an opening as possible . 
He stood in the hall , looking with infinite relief at Kemp refastening the door . 
`` Note was snatched out of her hand . 
Scared her horribly .
