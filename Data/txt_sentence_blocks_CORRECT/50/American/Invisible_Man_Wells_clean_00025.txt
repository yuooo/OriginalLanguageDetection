`` Diary , '' repeated Cuss , sitting down , putting two volumes to support the third , and opening it . 
`` H 'm -- no name on the fly-leaf . 
Bother ! 
-- cypher . 
And figures . '' 
The vicar came round to look over his shoulder . 
Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed . 
`` I 'm -- dear me ! 
It 's all cypher , Bunting . '' 
`` There are no diagrams ? '' 
asked Mr. Bunting . 
`` No illustrations throwing light -- '' `` See for yourself , '' said Mr. Cuss . 
`` Some of it 's mathematical and some of it 's Russian or some such language -LRB- to judge by the letters -RRB- , and some of it 's Greek . 
Now the Greek I thought _ you _ -- '' `` Of course , '' said Mr. Bunting , taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable -- for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about ; `` yes -- the Greek , of course , may furnish a clue . '' 
`` I 'll find you a place . '' 
`` I 'd rather glance through the volumes first , '' said Mr. Bunting , still wiping . 
`` A general impression first , Cuss , and then , you know , we can go looking for clues . '' 
He coughed , put on his glasses , arranged them fastidiously , coughed again , and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure . 
Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner . 
And then something did happen . 
The door opened suddenly . 
Both gentlemen started violently , looked round , and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat . 
`` Tap ? '' 
asked the face , and stood staring . 
`` No , '' said both gentlemen at once . 
`` Over the other side , my man , '' said Mr. Bunting . 
And `` Please shut that door , '' said Mr. Cuss , irritably . 
`` All right , '' said the intruder , as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry . 
`` Right you are , '' said the intruder in the former voice . 
`` Stand clear ! '' 
and he vanished and closed the door . 
`` A sailor , I should judge , '' said Mr. Bunting . 
`` Amusing fellows , they are . 
Stand clear ! 
indeed . 
A nautical term , referring to his getting back out of the room , I suppose . '' 
`` I daresay so , '' said Cuss . 
`` My nerves are all loose to-day . 
It quite made me jump -- the door opening like that . '' 
Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped . 
`` And now , '' he said with a sigh , `` these books . '' 
Someone sniffed as he did so . 
`` One thing is indisputable , '' said Bunting , drawing up a chair next to that of Cuss . 
`` There certainly have been very strange things happen in Iping during the last few days -- very strange . 
I can not of course believe in this absurd invisibility story -- '' `` It 's incredible , '' said Cuss -- `` incredible . 
But the fact remains that I saw -- I certainly saw right down his sleeve -- '' `` But did you -- are you sure ? 
Suppose a mirror , for instance -- hallucinations are so easily produced . 
I do n't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror -- '' `` I wo n't argue again , '' said Cuss . 
`` We 've thrashed that out , Bunting . 
And just now there 's these books -- Ah !
