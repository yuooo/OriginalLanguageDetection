`` Why , you did . '' 
`` I DID N'T nuther . '' 
`` You did ! '' 
`` I did n't . '' 
`` You did . '' 
`` I never said nothing of the kind . '' 
`` Well , what DID you say , then ? '' 
`` Said he come to take the sea BATHS -- that 's what I said . '' 
`` Well , then , how 's he going to take the sea baths if it ai n't on the sea ? '' 
`` Looky here , '' I says ; `` did you ever see any Congress-water ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , did you have to go to Congress to get it ? '' 
`` Why , no . '' 
`` Well , neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath . '' 
`` How does he get it , then ? '' 
`` Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water -- in barrels . 
There in the palace at Sheffield they 've got furnaces , and he wants his water hot . 
They ca n't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea . 
They have n't got no conveniences for it . '' 
`` Oh , I see , now . 
You might a said that in the first place and saved time . '' 
When she said that I see I was out of the woods again , and so I was comfortable and glad . 
Next , she says : `` Do you go to church , too ? '' 
`` Yes -- regular . '' 
`` Where do you set ? '' 
`` Why , in our pew . '' 
`` WHOSE pew ? '' 
`` Why , OURN -- your Uncle Harvey 's . '' 
`` His ` n ? 
What does HE want with a pew ? '' 
`` Wants it to set in . 
What did you RECKON he wanted with it ? '' 
`` Why , I thought he 'd be in the pulpit . '' 
Rot him , I forgot he was a preacher . 
I see I was up a stump again , so I played another chicken bone and got another think . 
Then I says : `` Blame it , do you suppose there ai n't but one preacher to a church ? '' 
`` Why , what do they want with more ? '' 
`` What ! 
-- to preach before a king ? 
I never did see such a girl as you . 
They do n't have no less than seventeen . '' 
`` Seventeen ! 
My land ! 
Why , I would n't set out such a string as that , not if I NEVER got to glory . 
It must take 'em a week . '' 
`` Shucks , they do n't ALL of 'em preach the same day -- only ONE of 'em . '' 
`` Well , then , what does the rest of 'em do ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing much . 
Loll around , pass the plate -- and one thing or another . 
But mainly they do n't do nothing . ''
