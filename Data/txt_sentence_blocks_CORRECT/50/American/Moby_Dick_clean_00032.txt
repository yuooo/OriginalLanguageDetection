cried the stranger . 
`` Ye said true -- ye hav 'n' t seen Old Thunder yet , have ye ? '' 
`` Who 's Old Thunder ? '' 
said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner . 
`` Captain Ahab . '' 
`` What ! 
the captain of our ship , the Pequod ? '' 
`` Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name . 
Ye hav 'n' t seen him yet , have ye ? '' 
`` No , we hav 'n' t. He 's sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long . '' 
`` All right again before long ! '' 
laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh . 
`` Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before . '' 
`` What do you know about him ? '' 
`` What did they tell you about him ? 
Say that ! '' 
`` They did n't tell much of anything about him ; only I 've heard that he 's a good whale-hunter , and a good captain to his crew . '' 
`` That 's true , that 's true -- yes , both true enough . 
But you must jump when he gives an order . 
Step and growl ; growl and go -- that 's the word with Captain Ahab . 
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ? 
-- heard nothing about that , eh ? 
Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ? 
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy . 
Did n't ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ? 
No , I do n't think ye did ; how could ye ? 
Who knows it ? 
Not all Nantucket , I guess . 
But hows ` ever , mayhap , ye 've heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , I dare say . 
Oh , yes , that every one knows a ` most -- I mean they know he 's only one leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off . '' 
`` My friend , '' said I , `` what all this gibberish of yours is about , I do n't know , and I do n't much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head . 
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg . '' 
`` All about it , eh -- sure you do ? 
all ? 
`` Pretty sure . '' 
With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the beggar-like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said : -- `` Ye 've shipped , have ye ? 
Names down on the papers ? 
Well , well , what 's signed , is signed ; and what 's to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it wo n't be , after all . 
Any how , it 's all fixed and arranged a ` ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity 'em ! 
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I 'm sorry I stopped ye . '' 
`` Look here , friend , '' said I , `` if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that 's all I have to say . '' 
`` And it 's said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye . 
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ! 
Oh ! 
when ye get there , tell 'em I 've concluded not to make one of 'em . '' 
`` Ah , my dear fellow , you ca n't fool us that way -- you ca n't fool us . 
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him . '' 
`` Morning to ye , shipmates , morning . '' 
`` Morning it is , '' said I. `` Come along , Queequeg , let 's leave this crazy man . 
But stop , tell me your name , will you ? ''
