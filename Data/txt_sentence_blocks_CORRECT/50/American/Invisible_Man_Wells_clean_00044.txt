Kemp closed the door softly behind him , and the key was turned upon him forthwith . 
Then , as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face , the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked . 
Kemp slapped his brow with his hand . 
`` Am I dreaming ? 
Has the world gone mad -- or have I ? '' 
He laughed , and put his hand to the locked door . 
`` Barred out of my own bedroom , by a flagrant absurdity ! '' 
he said . 
He walked to the head of the staircase , turned , and stared at the locked doors . 
`` It 's fact , '' he said . 
He put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck . 
`` Undeniable fact ! 
`` But -- '' He shook his head hopelessly , turned , and went downstairs . 
He lit the dining-room lamp , got out a cigar , and began pacing the room , ejaculating . 
Now and then he would argue with himself . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
he said . 
`` Is there such a thing as an invisible animal ? 
... In the sea , yes . 
Thousands -- millions . 
All the larvae , all the little nauplii and tornarias , all the microscopic things , the jelly-fish . 
In the sea there are more things invisible than visible ! 
I never thought of that before . 
And in the ponds too ! 
All those little pond-life things -- specks of colourless translucent jelly ! 
But in air ? 
No ! 
`` It ca n't be . 
`` But after all -- why not ? 
`` If a man was made of glass he would still be visible . '' 
His meditation became profound . 
The bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again . 
Then it was merely an exclamation . 
He turned aside , walked out of the room , and went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there . 
It was a little room , because Dr. Kemp did not live by practice , and in it were the day 's newspapers . 
The morning 's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside . 
He caught it up , turned it over , and read the account of a `` Strange Story from Iping '' that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel . 
Kemp read it swiftly . 
`` Wrapped up ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Disguised ! 
Hiding it ! 
` No one seems to have been aware of his misfortune . ' 
What the devil is his game ? '' 
He dropped the paper , and his eye went seeking . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he said , and caught up the St. James ' Gazette , lying folded up as it arrived . 
`` Now we shall get at the truth , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
He rent the paper open ; a couple of columns confronted him . 
`` An Entire Village in Sussex goes Mad '' was the heading .
