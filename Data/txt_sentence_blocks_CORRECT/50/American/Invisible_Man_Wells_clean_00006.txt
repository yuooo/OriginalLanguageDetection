In the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips , that came trailing after her , at the end of interminable necks , and with vast black eyes . 
But being a sensible woman , she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again . 
THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February , at the beginning of the thaw , this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village . 
Next day his luggage arrived through the slush -- and very remarkable luggage it was . 
There were a couple of trunks indeed , such as a rational man might need , but in addition there were a box of books -- big , fat books , of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting -- and a dozen or more crates , boxes , and cases , containing objects packed in straw , as it seemed to Hall , tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw -- glass bottles . 
The stranger , muffled in hat , coat , gloves , and wrapper , came out impatiently to meet Fearenside 's cart , while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in . 
Out he came , not noticing Fearenside 's dog , who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at Hall 's legs . 
`` Come along with those boxes , '' he said . 
`` I 've been waiting long enough . '' 
And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate . 
No sooner had Fearenside 's dog caught sight of him , however , than it began to bristle and growl savagely , and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop , and then sprang straight at his hand . 
`` Whup ! '' 
cried Hall , jumping back , for he was no hero with dogs , and Fearenside howled , `` Lie down ! '' 
and snatched his whip . 
They saw the dog 's teeth had slipped the hand , heard a kick , saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger 's leg , and heard the rip of his trousering . 
Then the finer end of Fearenside 's whip reached his property , and the dog , yelping with dismay , retreated under the wheels of the waggon . 
It was all the business of a swift half-minute . 
No one spoke , everyone shouted . 
The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg , made as if he would stoop to the latter , then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn . 
They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom . 
`` You brute , you ! '' 
said Fearenside , climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand , while the dog watched him through the wheel . 
`` Come here , '' said Fearenside -- `` You 'd better . '' 
Hall had stood gaping . 
`` He wuz bit , '' said Hall . 
`` I 'd better go and see to en , '' and he trotted after the stranger . 
He met Mrs. Hall in the passage . 
`` Carrier 's darg , '' he said `` bit en . '' 
He went straight upstairs , and the stranger 's door being ajar , he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony , being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind . 
The blind was down and the room dim . 
He caught a glimpse of a most singular thing , what seemed a handless arm waving towards him , and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white , very like the face of a pale pansy . 
Then he was struck violently in the chest , hurled back , and the door slammed in his face and locked . 
It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe . 
A waving of indecipherable shapes , a blow , and a concussion . 
There he stood on the dark little landing , wondering what it might be that he had seen . 
A couple of minutes after , he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
There was Fearenside telling about it all over again for the second time ; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog did n't have no business to bite her guests ; there was Huxter , the general dealer from over the road , interrogative ; and Sandy Wadgers from the forge , judicial ; besides women and children , all of them saying fatuities : `` Would n't let en bite me , I knows '' ; '' ` Tas n't right have such dargs '' ; `` Whad _ ` e _ bite 'n for , than ? '' 
and so forth . 
Mr. Hall , staring at them from the steps and listening , found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs . 
Besides , his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions . 
`` He do n't want no help , he says , '' he said in answer to his wife 's inquiry . 
`` We 'd better be a-takin ' of his luggage in . '' 
`` He ought to have it cauterised at once , '' said Mr. Huxter ; `` especially if it 's at all inflamed . '' 
`` I 'd shoot en , that 's what I 'd do , '' said a lady in the group . 
Suddenly the dog began growling again . 
`` Come along , '' cried an angry voice in the doorway , and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up , and his hat-brim bent down . 
`` The sooner you get those things in the better I 'll be pleased . '' 
It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed . 
`` Was you hurt , sir ? '' 
said Fearenside .
