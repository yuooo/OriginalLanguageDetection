said the Voice . 
Mr. Marvel 's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches . 
`` Do n't drop those books , stupid , '' said the Voice , sharply -- overtaking him . 
`` The fact is , '' said the Voice , `` I shall have to make use of you ... . 
You 're a poor tool , but I must . '' 
`` I 'm a miserable tool , '' said Marvel . 
`` You are , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm the worst possible tool you could have , '' said Marvel . 
`` I 'm not strong , '' he said after a discouraging silence . 
`` I 'm not over strong , '' he repeated . 
`` No ? '' 
`` And my heart 's weak . 
That little business -- I pulled it through , of course -- but bless you ! 
I could have dropped . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` I have n't the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want . '' '' 
_ I 'll _ stimulate you . '' 
`` I wish you would n't . 
I would n't like to mess up your plans , you know . 
But I might -- out of sheer funk and misery . '' 
`` You 'd better not , '' said the Voice , with quiet emphasis . 
`` I wish I was dead , '' said Marvel . 
`` It ai n't justice , '' he said ; `` you must admit ... . 
It seems to me I 've a perfect right -- '' `` Get on ! '' 
said the Voice . 
Mr. Marvel mended his pace , and for a time they went in silence again . 
`` It 's devilish hard , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
This was quite ineffectual . 
He tried another tack . 
`` What do I make by it ? '' 
he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong . 
`` Oh ! 
_ shutup ! '' 
said the Voice , with sudden amazing vigour . 
`` I 'll see to you all right . 
You do what you 're told . 
You 'll do it all right . 
You 're a fool and all that , but you 'll do -- '' `` I tell you , sir , I 'm not the man for it . 
Respectfully -- but it is so -- '' `` If you do n't shut up I shall twist your wrist again , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` I want to think . '' 
Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees , and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming . 
`` I shall keep my hand on your shoulder , '' said the Voice , `` all through the village . 
Go straight through and try no foolery . 
It will be the worse for you if you do . '' 
`` I know that , '' sighed Mr. Marvel , `` I know all that . '' 
The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the little village with his burdens , and vanished into the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows . 
AT PORT STOWE Ten o'clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel , unshaven , dirty , and travel-stained , sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets , looking very weary , nervous , and uncomfortable , and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals , on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe . 
Beside him were the books , but now they were tied with string . 
The bundle had been abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst , in accordance with a charge in the plans of the Invisible Man . 
Mr. Marvel sat on the bench , and although no one took the slightest notice of him , his agitation remained at fever heat .
