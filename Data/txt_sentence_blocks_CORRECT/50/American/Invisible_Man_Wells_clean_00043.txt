`` Well , have my room -- have this room . '' 
`` But how can I sleep ? 
If I sleep -- he will get away . 
Ugh ! 
What does it matter ? '' 
`` What 's the shot wound ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
`` Nothing -- scratch and blood . 
Oh , God ! 
How I want sleep ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp . 
`` Because I 've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men , '' he said slowly . 
Kemp started . 
`` Fool that I am ! '' 
said the Invisible Man , striking the table smartly . 
`` I 've put the idea into your head . '' 
THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was , he refused to accept Kemp 's word that his freedom should be respected . 
He examined the two windows of the bedroom , drew up the blinds and opened the sashes , to confirm Kemp 's statement that a retreat by them would be possible . 
Outside the night was very quiet and still , and the new moon was setting over the down . 
Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors , to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom . 
Finally he expressed himself satisfied . 
He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the sound of a yawn . 
`` I 'm sorry , '' said the Invisible Man , `` if I can not tell you all that I have done to-night . 
But I am worn out . 
It 's grotesque , no doubt . 
It 's horrible ! 
But believe me , Kemp , in spite of your arguments of this morning , it is quit a possible thing . 
I have made a discovery . 
I meant to keep it to myself . 
I ca n't . 
I must have a partner . 
And you ... . 
We can do such things ... But to-morrow . 
Now , Kemp , I feel as though I must sleep or perish . '' 
Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment . 
`` I suppose I must leave you , '' he said . 
`` It 's -- incredible . 
Three things happening like this , overturning all my preconceptions -- would make me insane . 
But it 's real ! 
Is there anything more that I can get you ? '' 
`` Only bid me good-night , '' said Griffin . 
`` Good-night , '' said Kemp , and shook an invisible hand . 
He walked sideways to the door . 
Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him . 
`` Understand me ! '' 
said the dressing-gown . 
`` No attempts to hamper me , or capture me ! 
Or -- '' Kemp 's face changed a little . 
`` I thought I gave you my word , '' he said .
