Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone . 
He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet . 
`` This do ? '' 
he asked . 
It was taken from him . 
It hung limp for a moment in mid-air , fluttered weirdly , stood full and decorous buttoning itself , and sat down in his chair . 
`` Drawers , socks , slippers would be a comfort , '' said the Unseen , curtly . 
`` And food . '' 
`` Anything . 
But this is the insanest thing I ever was in , in my life ! '' 
He turned out his drawers for the articles , and then went downstairs to ransack his larder . 
He came back with some cold cutlets and bread , pulled up a light table , and placed them before his guest . 
`` Never mind knives , '' said his visitor , and a cutlet hung in mid-air , with a sound of gnawing . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
said Kemp , and sat down on a bedroom chair . 
`` I always like to get something about me before I eat , '' said the Invisible Man , with a full mouth , eating greedily . 
`` Queer fancy ! '' 
`` I suppose that wrist is all right , '' said Kemp . 
`` Trust me , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Of all the strange and wonderful -- '' `` Exactly . 
But it 's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging . 
My first stroke of luck ! 
Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night . 
You must stand that ! 
It 's a filthy nuisance , my blood showing , is n't it ? 
Quite a clot over there . 
Gets visible as it coagulates , I see . 
It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive ... . 
I 've been in the house three hours . '' 
`` But how 's it done ? '' 
began Kemp , in a tone of exasperation . 
`` Confound it ! 
The whole business -- it 's unreasonable from beginning to end . '' 
`` Quite reasonable , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Perfectly reasonable . '' 
He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle . 
Kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown . 
A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder , made a triangle of light under the left ribs . 
`` What were the shots ? '' 
he asked . 
`` How did the shooting begin ? '' 
`` There was a real fool of a man -- a sort of confederate of mine -- curse him ! 
-- who tried to steal my money . 
Has done so . '' 
`` Is he invisible too ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Ca n't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that ? 
I 'm hungry -- in pain . 
And you want me to tell stories ! ''
