Down towards the town , men and women were running , and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand . 
`` Spread out ! 
Spread out ! '' 
cried some one . 
Kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase . 
He stopped , and looked round , panting . 
`` He 's close here ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Form a line across -- '' He was hit hard under the ear , and went reeling , trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist . 
He just managed to keep his feet , and he struck a vain counter in the air . 
Then he was hit again under the jaw , and sprawled headlong on the ground . 
In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm , and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat , but the grip of one was weaker than the other ; he grasped the wrists , heard a cry of pain from his assailant , and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him , and struck something with a dull thud . 
He felt a drop of moisture on his face . 
The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed , and with a convulsive effort , Kemp loosed himself , grasped a limp shoulder , and rolled uppermost . 
He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground . 
`` I 've got him ! '' 
screamed Kemp . 
`` Help ! 
Help -- hold ! 
He 's down ! 
Hold his feet ! '' 
In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle , and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress . 
And there was no shouting after Kemp 's cry -- only a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing . 
Then came a mighty effort , and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees . 
Kemp clung to him in front like a hound to a stag , and a dozen hands gripped , clutched , and tore at the Unseen . 
The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back . 
Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over . 
There was , I am afraid , some savage kicking . 
Then suddenly a wild scream of `` Mercy ! 
Mercy ! '' 
that died down swiftly to a sound like choking . 
`` Get back , you fools ! '' 
cried the muffled voice of Kemp , and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms . 
`` He 's hurt , I tell you . 
Stand back ! '' 
There was a brief struggle to clear a space , and then the circle of eager faces saw the doctor kneeling , as it seemed , fifteen inches in the air , and holding invisible arms to the ground . 
Behind him a constable gripped invisible ankles . 
`` Do n't you leave go of en , '' cried the big navvy , holding a blood-stained spade ; `` he 's shamming . '' 
`` He 's not shamming , '' said the doctor , cautiously raising his knee ; `` and I 'll hold him . '' 
His face was bruised and already going red ; he spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip . 
He released one hand and seemed to be feeling at the face . 
`` The mouth 's all wet , '' he said . 
And then , `` Good God ! '' 
He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of the thing unseen . 
There was a pushing and shuffling , a sound of heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd . 
People now were coming out of the houses . 
The doors of the `` Jolly Cricketers '' stood suddenly wide open . 
Very little was said . 
Kemp felt about , his hand seeming to pass through empty air . 
`` He 's not breathing , '' he said , and then , `` I ca n't feel his heart .
