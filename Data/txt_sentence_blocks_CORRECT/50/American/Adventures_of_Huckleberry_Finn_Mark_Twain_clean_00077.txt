`` But they WILL -- and inside of two weeks -- and I KNOW it ! '' 
says I. Laws , it was out before I could think ! 
And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it AGAIN , say it AGAIN , say it AGAIN ! 
I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much , and was in a close place . 
I asked her to let me think a minute ; and she set there , very impatient and excited and handsome , but looking kind of happy and eased-up , like a person that 's had a tooth pulled out . 
So I went to studying it out . 
I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ai n't had no experience , and ca n't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here 's a case where I 'm blest if it do n't look to me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie . 
I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it 's so kind of strange and unregular . 
I never see nothing like it . 
Well , I says to myself at last , I 'm a-going to chance it ; I 'll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you 'll go to . 
Then I says : `` Miss Mary Jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days ? '' 
`` Yes ; Mr. Lothrop 's . 
Why ? '' 
`` Never mind why yet . 
If I 'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks -- here in this house -- and PROVE how I know it -- will you go to Mr. Lothrop 's and stay four days ? '' 
`` Four days ! '' 
she says ; `` I 'll stay a year ! '' 
`` All right , '' I says , `` I do n't want nothing more out of YOU than just your word -- I druther have it than another man 's kiss-the-Bible . '' 
She smiled and reddened up very sweet , and I says , `` If you do n't mind it , I 'll shut the door -- and bolt it . '' 
Then I come back and set down again , and says : `` Do n't you holler . 
Just set still and take it like a man . 
I got to tell the truth , and you want to brace up , Miss Mary , because it 's a bad kind , and going to be hard to take , but there ai n't no help for it . 
These uncles of yourn ai n't no uncles at all ; they 're a couple of frauds -- regular dead-beats . 
There , now we 're over the worst of it , you can stand the rest middling easy . '' 
It jolted her up like everything , of course ; but I was over the shoal water now , so I went right along , her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time , and told her every blame thing , from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat , clear through to where she flung herself on to the king 's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times -- and then up she jumps , with her face afire like sunset , and says : `` The brute ! 
Come , do n't waste a minute -- not a SECOND -- we 'll have them tarred and feathered , and flung in the river ! '' 
Says I : `` Cert ` nly . 
But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr. Lothrop 's , or -- '' `` Oh , '' she says , `` what am I THINKING about ! '' 
she says , and set right down again . 
`` Do n't mind what I said -- please do n't -- you WO N'T , now , WILL you ? '' 
Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first . 
`` I never thought , I was so stirred up , '' she says ; `` now go on , and I wo n't do so any more . 
You tell me what to do , and whatever you say I 'll do it . '' 
`` Well , '' I says , `` it 's a rough gang , them two frauds , and I 'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer , whether I want to or not -- I druther not tell you why ; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws , and I 'd be all right ; but there 'd be another person that you do n't know about who 'd be in big trouble . 
Well , we got to save HIM , hai n't we ? 
Of course . 
Well , then , we wo n't blow on them . '' 
Saying them words put a good idea in my head . 
I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds ; get them jailed here , and then leave . 
But I did n't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ; so I did n't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night . 
I says : `` Miss Mary Jane , I 'll tell you what we 'll do , and you wo n't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop 's so long , nuther . 
How fur is it ? '' 
`` A little short of four miles -- right out in the country , back here . '' 
`` Well , that 'll answer . 
Now you go along out there , and lay low till nine or half-past to-night , and then get them to fetch you home again -- tell them you 've thought of something . 
If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window , and if I do n't turn up wait TILL eleven , and THEN if I do n't turn up it means I 'm gone , and out of the way , and safe . 
Then you come out and spread the news around , and get these beats jailed . '' 
`` Good , '' she says , `` I 'll do it . '' 
`` And if it just happens so that I do n't get away , but get took up along with them , you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand , and you must stand by me all you can . '' 
`` Stand by you !
