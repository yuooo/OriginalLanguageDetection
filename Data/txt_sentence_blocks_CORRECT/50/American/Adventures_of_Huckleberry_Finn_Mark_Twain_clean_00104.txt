`` Clah to goodness I hai n't no notion , Miss ' Sally . 
She wuz on de clo ` sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain ' dah no mo ' now . '' 
`` I reckon the world IS coming to an end . 
I NEVER see the beat of it in all my born days . 
A shirt , and a sheet , and a spoon , and six can -- '' `` Missus , '' comes a young yaller wench , `` dey 's a brass cannelstick miss ` n. '' `` Cler out from here , you hussy , er I 'll take a skillet to ye ! '' 
Well , she was just a-biling . 
I begun to lay for a chance ; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated . 
She kept a-raging right along , running her insurrection all by herself , and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ; and at last Uncle Silas , looking kind of foolish , fishes up that spoon out of his pocket . 
She stopped , with her mouth open and her hands up ; and as for me , I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres . 
But not long , because she says : `` It 's JUST as I expected . 
So you had it in your pocket all the time ; and like as not you 've got the other things there , too . 
How 'd it get there ? '' 
`` I reely do n't know , Sally , '' he says , kind of apologizing , `` or you know I would tell . 
I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast , and I reckon I put it in there , not noticing , meaning to put my Testament in , and it must be so , because my Testament ai n't in ; but I 'll go and see ; and if the Testament is where I had it , I 'll know I did n't put it in , and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon , and -- '' `` Oh , for the land 's sake ! 
Give a body a rest ! 
Go ` long now , the whole kit and biling of ye ; and do n't come nigh me again till I 've got back my peace of mind . '' 
I 'd a heard her if she 'd a said it to herself , let alone speaking it out ; and I 'd a got up and obeyed her if I 'd a been dead . 
As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat , and the shingle - nail fell out on the floor , and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf , and never said nothing , and went out . 
Tom see him do it , and remembered about the spoon , and says : `` Well , it ai n't no use to send things by HIM no more , he ai n't reliable . '' 
Then he says : `` But he done us a good turn with the spoon , anyway , without knowing it , and so we 'll go and do him one without HIM knowing it -- stop up his rat-holes . '' 
There was a noble good lot of them down cellar , and it took us a whole hour , but we done the job tight and good and shipshape . 
Then we heard steps on the stairs , and blowed out our light and hid ; and here comes the old man , with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t ` other , looking as absent-minded as year before last . 
He went a mooning around , first to one rat-hole and then another , till he 'd been to them all . 
Then he stood about five minutes , picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking . 
Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs , saying : `` Well , for the life of me I ca n't remember when I done it . 
I could show her now that I war n't to blame on account of the rats . 
But never mind -- let it go . 
I reckon it would n't do no good . '' 
And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs , and then we left . 
He was a mighty nice old man . 
And always is . 
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we 'd got to have it ; so he took a think . 
When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming , and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and I slid one of them up my sleeve , and Tom says : `` Why , Aunt Sally , there ai n't but nine spoons YET . '' 
She says : `` Go ` long to your play , and do n't bother me . 
I know better , I counted 'm myself . '' 
`` Well , I 've counted them twice , Aunty , and I ca n't make but nine . '' 
She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count -- anybody would . 
`` I declare to gracious ther ' AI N'T but nine ! '' 
she says . 
`` Why , what in the world -- plague TAKE the things , I 'll count 'm again . '' 
So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : `` Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther 's TEN now ! '' 
and she looked huffy and bothered both . 
But Tom says : `` Why , Aunty , I do n't think there 's ten . '' 
`` You numskull , did n't you see me COUNT 'm ? '' 
`` I know , but -- '' `` Well , I 'll count 'm AGAIN . '' 
So I smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time . 
Well , she WAS in a tearing way -- just a-trembling all over , she was so mad . 
But she counted and counted till she got that addled she 'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong . 
Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west ; and she said cle ' r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she 'd skin us . 
So we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a - giving us our sailing orders , and Jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon .
