`` You must begin at once . 
You must set every available man to work ; you must prevent his leaving this district . 
Once he gets away , he may go through the countryside as he wills , killing and maiming . 
He dreams of a reign of terror ! 
A reign of terror , I tell you . 
You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping . 
The garrison must help . 
You must wire for help . 
The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value . 
I will tell you of that ! 
There is a man in your police station -- Marvel . '' 
`` I know , '' said Adye , `` I know . 
Those books -- yes . 
But the tramp ... '' `` Says he has n't them . 
But he thinks the tramp has . 
And you must prevent him from eating or sleeping ; day and night the country must be astir for him . 
Food must be locked up and secured , all food , so that he will have to break his way to it . 
The houses everywhere must be barred against him . 
Heaven send us cold nights and rain ! 
The whole country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting . 
I tell you , Adye , he is a danger , a disaster ; unless he is pinned and secured , it is frightful to think of the things that may happen . '' 
`` What else can we do ? '' 
said Adye . 
`` I must go down at once and begin organising . 
But why not come ? 
Yes -- you come too ! 
Come , and we must hold a sort of council of war -- get Hopps to help -- and the railway managers . 
By Jove ! 
it 's urgent . 
Come along -- tell me as we go . 
What else is there we can do ? 
Put that stuff down . '' 
In another moment Adye was leading the way downstairs . 
They found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air . 
`` He 's got away , sir , '' said one . 
`` We must go to the central station at once , '' said Adye . 
`` One of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us -- quickly . 
And now , Kemp , what else ? '' 
`` Dogs , '' said Kemp . 
`` Get dogs . 
They do n't see him , but they wind him . 
Get dogs . '' 
`` Good , '' said Adye . 
`` It 's not generally known , but the prison officials over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds . 
Dogs . 
What else ? '' 
`` Bear in mind , '' said Kemp , `` his food shows . 
After eating , his food shows until it is assimilated . 
So that he has to hide after eating . 
You must keep on beating .
