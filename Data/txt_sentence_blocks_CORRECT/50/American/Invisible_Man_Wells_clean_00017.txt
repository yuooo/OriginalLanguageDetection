I saw her skirts whisk , and he went after her . 
Did n't take ten seconds .

You just missed en -- '' There was a disturbance behind , and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house ; first Mr. Hall , very red and determined , then Mr. Bobby Jaffers , the village constable , and then the wary Mr. Wadgers . 
They had come now armed with a warrant . 
People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances . '' 
` Ed or no ` ed , '' said Jaffers , `` I got to ` rest en , and ` rest en I will . '' 
Mr. Hall marched up the steps , marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open . 
`` Constable , '' he said , `` do your duty . '' 
Jaffers marched in . 
Hall next , Wadgers last . 
They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them , with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other . 
`` That 's him ! '' 
said Hall . 
`` What the devil 's this ? '' 
came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure . 
`` You 're a damned rum customer , mister , '' said Mr. Jaffers . 
`` But ` ed or no ` ed , the warrant says ` body , ' and duty 's duty -- '' `` Keep off ! '' 
said the figure , starting back . 
Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese , and Mr. Hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it . 
Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers ' face . 
In another moment Jaffers , cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . 
He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . 
Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . 
A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together . 
`` Get the feet , '' said Jaffers between his teeth . 
Mr. Hall , endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and Mr. Wadgers , seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers , retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order . 
At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room . 
`` I 'll surrender , '' cried the stranger , though he had Jaffers down , and in another moment he stood up panting , a strange figure , headless and handless -- for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left . 
`` It 's no good , '' he said , as if sobbing for breath . 
It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space , but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun . 
Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs . 
Then he stared . 
`` I say ! '' 
said Jaffers , brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business , `` Darn it ! 
Ca n't use 'em as I can see . '' 
The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone . 
Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down . 
He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks . 
`` Why ! '' 
said Huxter , suddenly , `` that 's not a man at all . 
It 's just empty clothes .
