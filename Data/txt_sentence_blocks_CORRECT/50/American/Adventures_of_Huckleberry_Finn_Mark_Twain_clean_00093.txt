I says ; `` you 're joking . '' 
`` I ai n't joking , either . '' 
`` Well , then , '' I says , `` joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , do n't forget to remember that YOU do n't know nothing about him , and I do n't know nothing about him . '' 
Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and I drove mine . 
But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip . 
The old gentleman was at the door , and he says : `` Why , this is wonderful ! 
Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ? 
I wish we 'd a timed her . 
And she hai n't sweated a hair -- not a hair . 
It 's wonderful . 
Why , I would n't take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I would n't , honest ; and yet I 'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 't was all she was worth . '' 
That 's all he said . 
He was the innocentest , best old soul I ever see . 
But it war n't surprising ; because he war n't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too . 
There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that , and done the same way , down South . 
In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : `` Why , there 's somebody come ! 
I wonder who 't is ? 
Why , I do believe it 's a stranger . 
Jimmy '' -LRB- that 's one of the children -RRB- `` run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner . '' 
Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come EVERY year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come . 
Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door . 
Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer . 
In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable . 
He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram . 
When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : `` Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? '' 
`` No , my boy , '' says the old gentleman , `` I 'm sorry to say ' t your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more . 
Come in , come in . '' 
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , `` Too late -- he 's out of sight . '' 
`` Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's . '' 
`` Oh , I CA N'T make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it . 
I 'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance . '' 
`` But we wo n't LET you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it . 
Come right in . '' 
`` Oh , DO , '' says Aunt Sally ; `` it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world . 
You must stay . 
It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk . 
And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us . 
Come right in and make yourself at home . '' 
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow . 
Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : `` You owdacious puppy ! '' 
He looked kind of hurt , and says : `` I 'm surprised at you , m ` am . '' 
`` You 're s ` rp -- Why , what do you reckon I am ? 
I 've a good notion to take and -- Say , what do you mean by kissing me ? '' 
He looked kind of humble , and says : `` I did n't mean nothing , m ` am . 
I did n't mean no harm . 
I -- I -- thought you 'd like it . '' 
`` Why , you born fool ! '' 
She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it . 
`` What made you think I 'd like it ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know .
