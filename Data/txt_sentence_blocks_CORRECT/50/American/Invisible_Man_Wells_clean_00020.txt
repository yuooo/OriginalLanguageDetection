said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Lord ! 
But them boots ! 
It beats it . '' 
He turned his head over his shoulder to the right , to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons , and lo ! 
where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots . 
He was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement . 
`` Where are yer ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours . 
He saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote green-pointed furze bushes . 
`` Am I drunk ? '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Have I had visions ? 
Was I talking to myself ? 
What the -- '' `` Do n't be alarmed , '' said a Voice . 
`` None of your ventriloquising me , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rising sharply to his feet . 
`` Where are yer ? 
Alarmed , indeed ! '' 
`` Do n't be alarmed , '' repeated the Voice . '' 
_ You 'll _ be alarmed in a minute , you silly fool , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Where are yer ? 
Lem me get my mark on yer ... `` Are yer _ buried _ ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , after an interval . 
There was no answer . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed , his jacket nearly thrown off . 
`` Peewit , '' said a peewit , very remote . 
`` Peewit , indeed ! '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` This ai n't no time for foolery . '' 
The down was desolate , east and west , north and south ; the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes , ran smooth and empty north and south , and , save for that peewit , the blue sky was empty too . 
`` So help me , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again . 
`` It 's the drink ! 
I might ha ' known . '' 
`` It 's not the drink , '' said the Voice . 
`` You keep your nerves steady . '' 
`` Ow ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , and his face grew white amidst its patches . 
`` It 's the drink ! '' 
his lips repeated noiselessly . 
He remained staring about him , rotating slowly backwards . 
`` I could have swore I heard a voice , '' he whispered . 
`` Of course you did . '' 
`` It 's there again , '' said Mr. Marvel , closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture . 
He was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently , and left more dazed than ever . 
`` Do n't be a fool , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm -- off -- my -- blooming -- chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` It 's no good . 
It 's fretting about them blarsted boots . 
I 'm off my blessed blooming chump . 
Or it 's spirits . ''
