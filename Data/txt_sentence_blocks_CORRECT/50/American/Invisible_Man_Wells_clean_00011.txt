Interrogative cough . 
` How the devil , ' said I , ` can you move an empty sleeve like that ? ' 
'Em pty sleeve ? ' 
` Yes , ' said I , ` an empty sleeve . ' '' 
` It 's an empty sleeve , is it ? 
You saw it was an empty sleeve ? ' 
He stood up right away . 
I stood up too . 
He came towards me in three very slow steps , and stood quite close . 
Sniffed venomously . 
I did n't flinch , though I 'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his , and those blinkers , are n't enough to unnerve any one , coming quietly up to you . '' 
` You said it was an empty sleeve ? ' 
he said . 
` Certainly , ' I said . 
At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man , unspectacled , starts scratch . 
Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again , and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again . 
He did it very , very slowly . 
I looked at it . 
Seemed an age . 
` Well ? ' 
said I , clearing my throat , ` there 's nothing in it . ' 
`` Had to say something . 
I was beginning to feel frightened . 
I could see right down it . 
He extended it straight towards me , slowly , slowly -- just like that -- until the cuff was six inches from my face . 
Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that ! 
And then -- '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Something -- exactly like a finger and thumb it felt -- nipped my nose . '' 
Bunting began to laugh . 
`` There was n't anything there ! '' 
said Cuss , his voice running up into a shriek at the `` there . '' 
`` It 's all very well for you to laugh , but I tell you I was so startled , I hit his cuff hard , and turned around , and cut out of the room -- I left him -- '' Cuss stopped . 
There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic . 
He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar 's very inferior sherry . 
`` When I hit his cuff , '' said Cuss , `` I tell you , it felt exactly like hitting an arm . 
And there was n't an arm ! 
There was n't the ghost of an arm ! '' 
Mr. Bunting thought it over . 
He looked suspiciously at Cuss . 
`` It 's a most remarkable story , '' he said . 
He looked very wise and grave indeed . 
`` It 's really , '' said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis , `` a most remarkable story . '' 
THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife . 
It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday , the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities . 
Mrs. Bunting , it seems , woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn , with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed . 
She did not arouse her husband at first , but sat up in bed listening . 
She then distinctly heard the pad , pad , pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the staircase . 
As soon as she felt assured of this , she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible . 
He did not strike a light , but putting on his spectacles , her dressing-gown and his bath slippers , he went out on the landing to listen . 
He heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs , and then a violent sneeze .
