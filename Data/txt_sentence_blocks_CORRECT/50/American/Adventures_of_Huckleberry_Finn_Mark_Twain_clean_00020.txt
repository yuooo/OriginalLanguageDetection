Dese las ' skifts wuz full o ' ladies en genlmen a-goin ' over for to see de place . 
Sometimes dey 'd pull up at de sho ' en take a res ' b ` fo ' dey started acrost , so by de talk I got to know all ` bout de killin ' . 
I ` uz powerful sorry you 's killed , Huck , but I ai n't no mo ' now . 
`` I laid dah under de shavin 's all day . 
I ` uz hungry , but I war n't afeard ; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin ' to start to de camp-meet 'n' right arter breakfas ' en be gone all day , en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ` bout daylight , so dey wouldn ' ` spec to see me roun ' de place , en so dey wouldn ' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin ' . 
De yuther servants wouldn ' miss me , kase dey 'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ` uz out 'n de way . 
`` Well , when it come dark I tuck out up de river road , en went ` bout two mile er more to whah dey war n't no houses . 
I 'd made up my mine ` bout what I 's agwyne to do . 
You see , ef I kep ' on tryin ' to git away afoot , de dogs ` ud track me ; ef I stole a skift to cross over , dey 'd miss dat skift , you see , en dey 'd know ` bout whah I 'd lan ' on de yuther side , en whah to pick up my track . 
So I says , a raff is what I 's arter ; it doan ' MAKE no track . 
`` I see a light a-comin ' roun ' de p ` int bymeby , so I wade ' in en shove ' a log ahead o ' me en swum more 'n half way acrost de river , en got in ` mongst de drift-wood , en kep ' my head down low , en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along . 
Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a - holt . 
It clouded up en ` uz pooty dark for a little while . 
So I clumb up en laid down on de planks . 
De men ` uz all ` way yonder in de middle , whah de lantern wuz . 
De river wuz a-risin ' , en dey wuz a good current ; so I reck 'n' d ` at by fo ' in de mawnin ' I 'd be twenty-five mile down de river , en den I 'd slip in jis b ` fo ' daylight en swim asho ' , en take to de woods on de Illinois side . 
`` But I didn ' have no luck . 
When we ` uz mos ' down to de head er de islan ' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern , I see it war n't no use fer to wait , so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan ' . 
Well , I had a notion I could lan ' mos ' anywhers , but I could n't -- bank too bluff . 
I ` uz mos ' to de foot er de islan ' b ` fo ' I found ' a good place . 
I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn ' fool wid raffs no mo ' , long as dey move de lantern roun ' so . 
I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg , en some matches in my cap , en dey war n't wet , so I ` uz all right . '' 
`` And so you ai n't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ? 
Why did n't you get mud-turkles ? '' 
`` How you gwyne to git 'm ? 
You ca n't slip up on um en grab um ; en how 's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ? 
How could a body do it in de night ? 
En I war n't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime . '' 
`` Well , that 's so . 
You 've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course . 
Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon ? '' 
`` Oh , yes . 
I knowed dey was arter you . 
I see um go by heah -- watched um thoo de bushes . '' 
Some young birds come along , flying a yard or two at a time and lighting . 
Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain . 
He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it . 
I was going to catch some of them , but Jim would n't let me . 
He said it was death . 
He said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old granny said his father would die , and he did . 
And Jim said you must n't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck . 
The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown . 
And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die . 
Jim said bees would n't sting idiots ; but I did n't believe that , because I had tried them lots of times myself , and they would n't sting me . 
I had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them . 
Jim knowed all kinds of signs . 
He said he knowed most everything . 
I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so I asked him if there war n't any good-luck signs . 
He says : `` Mighty few -- an ' DEY ai n't no use to a body . 
What you want to know when good luck 's a-comin ' for ?
