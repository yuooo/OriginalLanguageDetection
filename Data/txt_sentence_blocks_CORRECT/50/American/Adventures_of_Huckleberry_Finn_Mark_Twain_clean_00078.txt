indeed I will . 
They sha 'n' t touch a hair of your head ! '' 
she says , and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it , too . 
`` If I get away I sha 'n' t be here , '' I says , `` to prove these rapscallions ai n't your uncles , and I could n't do it if I WAS here . 
I could swear they was beats and bummers , that 's all , though that 's worth something . 
Well , there 's others can do that better than what I can , and they 're people that ai n't going to be doubted as quick as I 'd be . 
I 'll tell you how to find them . 
Gim me a pencil and a piece of paper . 
There -- ` Royal Nonesuch , Bricksville . ' 
Put it away , and do n't lose it . 
When the court wants to find out something about these two , let them send up to Bricksville and say they 've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch , and ask for some witnesses -- why , you 'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink , Miss Mary . 
And they 'll come a-biling , too . '' 
I judged we had got everything fixed about right now . 
So I says : `` Just let the auction go right along , and do n't worry . 
Nobody do n't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice , and they ai n't going out of this till they get that money ; and the way we 've fixed it the sale ai n't going to count , and they ai n't going to get no money . 
It 's just like the way it was with the niggers -- it war n't no sale , and the niggers will be back before long . 
Why , they ca n't collect the money for the NIGGERS yet -- they 're in the worst kind of a fix , Miss Mary . '' 
`` Well , '' she says , `` I 'll run down to breakfast now , and then I 'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop 's . '' '' 
` Deed , THAT ai n't the ticket , Miss Mary Jane , '' I says , `` by no manner of means ; go BEFORE breakfast . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for , Miss Mary ? '' 
`` Well , I never thought -- and come to think , I do n't know . 
What was it ? '' 
`` Why , it 's because you ai n't one of these leather-face people . 
I do n't want no better book than what your face is . 
A body can set down and read it off like coarse print . 
Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning , and never -- '' `` There , there , do n't ! 
Yes , I 'll go before breakfast -- I 'll be glad to . 
And leave my sisters with them ? '' 
`` Yes ; never mind about them . 
They 've got to stand it yet a while . 
They might suspicion something if all of you was to go . 
I do n't want you to see them , nor your sisters , nor nobody in this town ; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something . 
No , you go right along , Miss Mary Jane , and I 'll fix it with all of them . 
I 'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you 've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change , or to see a friend , and you 'll be back to-night or early in the morning . '' 
`` Gone to see a friend is all right , but I wo n't have my love given to them . '' 
`` Well , then , it sha 'n' t be . '' 
It was well enough to tell HER so -- no harm in it . 
It was only a little thing to do , and no trouble ; and it 's the little things that smooths people 's roads the most , down here below ; it would make Mary Jane comfortable , and it would n't cost nothing . 
Then I says : `` There 's one more thing -- that bag of money . '' 
`` Well , they 've got that ; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it . '' 
`` No , you 're out , there . 
They hai n't got it . '' 
`` Why , who 's got it ? '' 
`` I wish I knowed , but I do n't . 
I HAD it , because I stole it from them ; and I stole it to give to you ; and I know where I hid it , but I 'm afraid it ai n't there no more . 
I 'm awful sorry , Miss Mary Jane , I 'm just as sorry as I can be ; but I done the best I could ; I did honest . 
I come nigh getting caught , and I had to shove it into the first place I come to , and run -- and it war n't a good place . '' 
`` Oh , stop blaming yourself -- it 's too bad to do it , and I wo n't allow it -- you could n't help it ; it was n't your fault . 
Where did you hide it ? ''
