Do n't cry , bub . 
What 's the trouble ? '' 
I says : `` Pap , and mam , and sis , and -- '' Then I broke down . 
He says : `` Oh , dang it now , DO N'T take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this 'n 'll come out all right . 
What 's the matter with 'em ? '' 
`` They 're -- they 're -- are you the watchman of the boat ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he says , kind of pretty-well-satisfied like . 
`` I 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand ; and sometimes I 'm the freight and passengers . 
I ai n't as rich as old Jim Hornback , and I ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to Tom , Dick , and Harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but I 've told him a many a time ' t I would n't trade places with him ; for , says I , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and I 'm derned if I 'D live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin ' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it . 
Says I -- '' I broke in and says : `` They 're in an awful peck of trouble , and -- '' `` WHO is ? '' 
`` Why , pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there -- '' `` Up where ? 
Where are they ? '' 
`` On the wreck . '' 
`` What wreck ? '' 
`` Why , there ai n't but one . '' 
`` What , you do n't mean the Walter Scott ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good land ! 
what are they doin ' THERE , for gracious sakes ? '' 
`` Well , they did n't go there a-purpose . '' 
`` I bet they did n't ! 
Why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick ! 
Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ? '' 
`` Easy enough . 
Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town -- '' `` Yes , Booth 's Landing -- go on . '' 
`` She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a - floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck . 
Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so WE saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he WAS the best cretur ! 
-- I most wish ' t it had been me , I do . '' 
`` My George ! 
It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck . 
And THEN what did you all do ? '' 
`` Well , we hollered and took on , but it 's so wide there we could n't make nobody hear . 
So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow . 
I was the only one that could swim , so I made a dash for it , and Miss Hooker she said if I did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing . 
I made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , ` What , in such a night and such a current ? 
There ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . ' 
Now if you 'll go and -- '' `` By Jackson , I 'd LIKE to , and , blame it , I do n't know but I will ; but who in the dingnation 's a-going ' to PAY for it ? 
Do you reckon your pap -- '' `` Why THAT 'S all right . 
Miss Hooker she tole me , PARTICULAR , that her uncle Hornback -- '' `` Great guns ! 
is HE her uncle ? 
Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill . 
And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news . 
Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town . 
Hump yourself , now ; I 'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer . '' 
I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start . 
But take it all around , I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it . 
I wished the widow knowed about it . 
I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in . 
Well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down ! 
A kind of cold shiver went through me , and then I struck out for her .
