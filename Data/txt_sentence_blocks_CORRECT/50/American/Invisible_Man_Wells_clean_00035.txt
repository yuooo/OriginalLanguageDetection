They were shouting in the street before Marvel was halfway there . 
They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them , with the news . 
He heard it and made one last desperate spurt . 
Fear came striding by , rushed ahead of him , and in a moment had seized the town . 
`` The Invisible Man is coming ! 
The Invisible Man ! '' 
IN THE `` JOLLY CRICKETERS '' The `` Jolly Cricketers '' is just at the bottom of the hill , where the tram-lines begin . 
The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman , while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese , drank Burton , and conversed in American with a policeman off duty . 
`` What 's the shouting about ! '' 
said the anaemic cabman , going off at a tangent , trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn . 
Somebody ran by outside . 
`` Fire , perhaps , '' said the barman . 
Footsteps approached , running heavily , the door was pushed open violently , and Marvel , weeping and dishevelled , his hat gone , the neck of his coat torn open , rushed in , made a convulsive turn , and attempted to shut the door . 
It was held half open by a strap . 
`` Coming ! '' 
he bawled , his voice shrieking with terror . 
`` He 's coming . 
The ` Visible Man ! 
After me ! 
For Gawd 's sake ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! '' 
`` Shut the doors , '' said the policeman . 
`` Who 's coming ? 
What 's the row ? '' 
He went to the door , released the strap , and it slammed . 
The American closed the other door . 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , staggering and weeping , but still clutching the books . 
`` Lem me go inside . 
Lock me in -- somewhere . 
I tell you he 's after me . 
I give him the slip . 
He said he 'd kill me and he will . '' '' 
_ You 're _ safe , '' said the man with the black beard . 
`` The door 's shut . 
What 's it all about ? '' 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside . 
`` Hullo , '' cried the policeman , `` who 's there ? '' 
Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors . 
`` He 'll kill me -- he 's got a knife or something . 
For Gawd 's sake -- ! '' 
`` Here you are , '' said the barman . 
`` Come in here . '' 
And he held up the flap of the bar . 
Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated . 
`` Do n't open the door , '' he screamed . 
`` Please do n't open the door . 
Where shall I hide ? '' 
`` This , this Invisible Man , then ? ''
