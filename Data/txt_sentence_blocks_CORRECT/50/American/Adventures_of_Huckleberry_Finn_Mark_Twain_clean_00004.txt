`` Now , '' says Ben Rogers , `` what 's the line of business of this Gang ? '' 
`` Nothing only robbery and murder , '' Tom said . 
`` But who are we going to rob ? 
-- houses , or cattle , or -- '' `` Stuff ! 
stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , '' says Tom Sawyer . 
`` We ai n't burglars . 
That ai n't no sort of style . 
We are highwaymen . 
We stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money . '' 
`` Must we always kill the people ? '' 
`` Oh , certainly . 
It 's best . 
Some authorities think different , but mostly it 's considered best to kill them -- except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they 're ransomed . '' 
`` Ransomed ? 
What 's that ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
But that 's what they do . 
I 've seen it in books ; and so of course that 's what we 've got to do . '' 
`` But how can we do it if we do n't know what it is ? '' 
`` Why , blame it all , we 've GOT to do it . 
Do n't I tell you it 's in the books ? 
Do you want to go to doing different from what 's in the books , and get things all muddled up ? '' 
`` Oh , that 's all very fine to SAY , Tom Sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we do n't know how to do it to them ? 
-- that 's the thing I want to get at . 
Now , what do you reckon it is ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't know . 
But per ` aps if we keep them till they 're ransomed , it means that we keep them till they 're dead . '' 
`` Now , that 's something LIKE . 
That 'll answer . 
Why could n't you said that before ? 
We 'll keep them till they 're ransomed to death ; and a bothersome lot they 'll be , too -- eating up everything , and always trying to get loose . '' 
`` How you talk , Ben Rogers . 
How can they get loose when there 's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ? '' 
`` A guard ! 
Well , that IS good . 
So somebody 's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them . 
I think that 's foolishness . 
Why ca n't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ? '' 
`` Because it ai n't in the books so -- that 's why . 
Now , Ben Rogers , do you want to do things regular , or do n't you ? 
-- that 's the idea . 
Do n't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what 's the correct thing to do ? 
Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything ? 
Not by a good deal . 
No , sir , we 'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way . '' 
`` All right . 
I do n't mind ; but I say it 's a fool way , anyhow . 
Say , do we kill the women , too ? '' 
`` Well , Ben Rogers , if I was as ignorant as you I would n't let on . 
Kill the women ?
