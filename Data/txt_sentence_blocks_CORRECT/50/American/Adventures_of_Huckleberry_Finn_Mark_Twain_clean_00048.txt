I heard Buck 's gun go off at my ear , and Harney 's hat tumbled off from his head . 
He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid . 
But we did n't wait . 
We started through the woods on a run . 
The woods war n't thick , so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat , I reckon , but I could n't see . 
We never stopped running till we got home . 
The old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute -- 't was pleasure , mainly , I judged -- then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : `` I do n't like that shooting from behind a bush . 
Why did n't you step into the road , my boy ? '' 
`` The Shepherdsons do n't , father . 
They always take advantage . '' 
Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped . 
The two young men looked dark , but never said nothing . 
Miss Sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt . 
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says : `` Did you want to kill him , Buck ? '' 
`` Well , I bet I did . '' 
`` What did he do to you ? '' 
`` Him ? 
He never done nothing to me . '' 
`` Well , then , what did you want to kill him for ? '' 
`` Why , nothing -- only it 's on account of the feud . '' 
`` What 's a feud ? '' 
`` Why , where was you raised ? 
Do n't you know what a feud is ? '' 
`` Never heard of it before -- tell me about it . '' 
`` Well , '' says Buck , `` a feud is this way : A man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills HIM ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the COUSINS chip in -- and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ai n't no more feud . 
But it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time . '' 
`` Has this one been going on long , Buck ? '' 
`` Well , I should RECKON ! 
It started thirty year ago , or som ` ers along there . 
There was trouble ` bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit -- which he would naturally do , of course . 
Anybody would . '' 
`` What was the trouble about , Buck ? 
-- land ? '' 
`` I reckon maybe -- I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , who done the shooting ? 
Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson ? '' 
`` Laws , how do I know ? 
It was so long ago . '' 
`` Do n't anybody know ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , pa knows , I reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they do n't know now what the row was about in the first place . '' 
`` Has there been many killed , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes ; right smart chance of funerals . 
But they do n't always kill . 
Pa 's got a few buckshot in him ; but he do n't mind it ` cuz he do n't weigh much , anyway . 
Bob 's been carved up some with a bowie , and Tom 's been hurt once or twice . '' 
`` Has anybody been killed this year , Buck ? '' 
`` Yes ; we got one and they got one . 
` Bout three months ago my cousin Bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t ` other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame ' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind ; and ` stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , Bud ` lowed he could out-run him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man a-gaining all the time ; so at last Bud seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down . 
But he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out . '' 
`` I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck . ''
