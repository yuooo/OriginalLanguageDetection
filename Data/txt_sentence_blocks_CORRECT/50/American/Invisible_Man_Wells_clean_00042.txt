Kemp got up . 
`` You did n't do any shooting ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Not me , '' said his visitor . 
`` Some fool I 'd never seen fired at random . 
A lot of them got scared . 
They all got scared at me . 
Curse them ! 
-- I say -- I want more to eat than this , Kemp . '' 
`` I 'll see what there is to eat downstairs , '' said Kemp . 
`` Not much , I 'm afraid . '' 
After he had done eating , and he made a heavy meal , the Invisible Man demanded a cigar . 
He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a knife , and cursed when the outer leaf loosened . 
It was strange to see him smoking ; his mouth , and throat , pharynx and nares , became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast . 
`` This blessed gift of smoking ! '' 
he said , and puffed vigorously . 
`` I 'm lucky to have fallen upon you , Kemp . 
You must help me . 
Fancy tumbling on you just now ! 
I 'm in a devilish scrape -- I 've been mad , I think . 
The things I have been through ! 
But we will do things yet . 
Let me tell you -- '' He helped himself to more whiskey and soda . 
Kemp got up , looked about him , and fetched a glass from his spare room . 
`` It 's wild -- but I suppose I may drink . '' 
`` You have n't changed much , Kemp , these dozen years . 
You fair men do n't . 
Cool and methodical -- after the first collapse . 
I must tell you . 
We will work together ! '' 
`` But how was it all done ? '' 
said Kemp , `` and how did you get like this ? '' 
`` For God 's sake , let me smoke in peace for a little while ! 
And then I will begin to tell you . '' 
But the story was not told that night . 
The Invisible Man 's wrist was growing painful ; he was feverish , exhausted , and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn . 
He spoke in fragments of Marvel , he smoked faster , his voice grew angry . 
Kemp tried to gather what he could . 
`` He was afraid of me , I could see that he was afraid of me , '' said the Invisible Man many times over . 
`` He meant to give me the slip -- he was always casting about ! 
What a fool I was ! '' 
`` The cur ! 
`` I should have killed him ! '' 
`` Where did you get the money ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
The Invisible Man was silent for a space . 
`` I ca n't tell you to-night , '' he said . 
He groaned suddenly and leant forward , supporting his invisible head on invisible hands . 
`` Kemp , '' he said , `` I 've had no sleep for near three days , except a couple of dozes of an hour or so . 
I must sleep soon . ''
