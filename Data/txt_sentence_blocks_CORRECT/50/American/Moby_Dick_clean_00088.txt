With not one tenth of England 's experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . 
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . 
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals . 
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager -LRB- I honor him for a veteran -RRB- , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace . 
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself `` H. Durand . '' 
One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . 
It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . 
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . 
The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove-to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel -LRB- in the act of cutting-in -RRB- hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . 
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half-erect out of the water , like a rearing horse . 
From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen . 
Of Whales in Paint ; in Teeth ; in Wood ; in Sheet-Iron ; in Stone ; in Mountains ; in Stars On Tower-hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar -LRB- or kedger , as the sailors say -RRB- holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg . 
There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats -LRB- presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity -RRB- is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale . 
Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world . 
But the time of his justification has now come . 
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings . 
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . 
Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . 
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . 
But , in general , they toil with their jack-knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner 's fancy . 
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i.e. what is called savagery . 
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois . 
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . 
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . 
An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon . 
For , with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark 's tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application . 
As with the Hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor-savage . 
With the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark 's tooth , of his one poor jack-knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles 's shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer . 
Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers . 
Some of them are done with much accuracy . 
At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door . 
When the porter is sleepy , the anvil-headed whale would be best . 
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . 
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weathercocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with `` Hands off ! '' 
you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit . 
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges . 
Then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges . 
But you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point , else so chance-like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery ; like the Solomon islands , which still remain incognita , though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them . 
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds . 
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me . 
And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis , and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish . 
With a frigate 's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight ! 
Brit Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds . 
For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat . 
On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm-Whaler like the Pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lips . 
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea . 
* * That part of the sea known among whalemen as the `` Brazil Banks '' does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased . 
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers . 
Seen from the mast-heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else . 
And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea .
