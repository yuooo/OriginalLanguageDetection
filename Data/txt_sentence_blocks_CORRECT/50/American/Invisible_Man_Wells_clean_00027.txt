`` What the dooce ? '' 
exclaimed Henfrey , sotto voce . 
`` You -- all -- right thur ? '' 
asked Mr. Hall , sharply , again . 
The Vicar 's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation : `` Quite ri-right . 
Please do n't -- interrupt . '' 
`` Odd ! '' 
said Mr. Henfrey . 
`` Odd ! '' 
said Mr. Hall . 
`` Says , ` Do n't interrupt , ' '' said Henfrey . 
`` I heerd ` n , '' said Hall . 
`` And a sniff , '' said Henfrey . 
They remained listening . 
The conversation was rapid and subdued . 
`` I ca n't , '' said Mr. Bunting , his voice rising ; `` I tell you , sir , I will not . '' 
`` What was that ? '' 
asked Henfrey . 
`` Says he wi ' nart , '' said Hall . 
`` War n't speaking to us , wuz he ? '' 
`` Disgraceful ! '' 
said Mr. Bunting , within . '' 
` Disgraceful , ' '' said Mr. Henfrey . 
`` I heard it -- distinct . '' 
`` Who 's that speaking now ? '' 
asked Henfrey . 
`` Mr. Cuss , I s ` pose , '' said Hall . 
`` Can you hear -- anything ? '' 
Silence . 
The sounds within indistinct and perplexing . 
`` Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about , '' said Hall . 
Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar . 
Hall made gestures of silence and invitation . 
This aroused Mrs. Hall 's wifely opposition . 
`` What yer listenin ' there for , Hall ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Ai n't you nothin ' better to do -- busy day like this ? '' 
Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show , but Mrs. Hall was obdurate . 
She raised her voice . 
So Hall and Henfrey , rather crestfallen , tiptoed back to the bar , gesticulating to explain to her . 
At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all . 
Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence , while Henfrey told her his story . 
She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense -- perhaps they were just moving the furniture about . 
`` I heerd 'n say ` disgraceful ' ; that I did , '' said Hall . 
`` I heerd that , Mrs. Hall , '' said Henfrey . 
`` Like as not -- '' began Mrs. Hall . 
`` Hsh ! '' 
said Mr. Teddy Henfrey . 
`` Did n't I hear the window ? '' 
`` What window ? ''
