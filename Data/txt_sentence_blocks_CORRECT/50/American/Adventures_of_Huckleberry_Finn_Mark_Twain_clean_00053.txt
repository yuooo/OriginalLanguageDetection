`` Old man , '' said the young one , `` I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think ? '' 
`` I ai n't undisposed . 
What 's your line -- mainly ? '' 
`` Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work . 
What 's your lay ? '' 
`` I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time . 
Layin ' on o ' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k 'n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me . 
Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around . '' 
Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : `` Alas ! '' 
`` What 're you alassin ' about ? '' 
says the bald-head . 
`` To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . '' 
And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag . 
`` Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? '' 
says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish . 
`` Yes , it IS good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high ? 
I did myself . 
I do n't blame YOU , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody . 
I deserve it all . 
Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me . 
The world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me -- loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that . 
Some day I 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest . '' 
He went on a-wiping . 
`` Drot your pore broken heart , '' says the baldhead ; `` what are you heaving your pore broken heart at US f ` r ? 
WE hai n't done nothing . '' 
`` No , I know you have n't . 
I ai n't blaming you , gentlemen . 
I brought myself down -- yes , I did it myself . 
It 's right I should suffer -- perfectly right -- I do n't make any moan . '' 
`` Brought you down from whar ? 
Whar was you brought down from ? '' 
`` Ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes -- let it pass -- 't is no matter . 
The secret of my birth -- '' `` The secret of your birth ! 
Do you mean to say -- '' `` Gentlemen , '' says the young man , very solemn , `` I will reveal it to you , for I feel I may have confidence in you . 
By rights I am a duke ! '' 
Jim 's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and I reckon mine did , too . 
Then the baldhead says : `` No ! 
you ca n't mean it ? '' 
`` Yes . 
My great-grandfather , eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time . 
The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored . 
I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft ! '' 
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I . 
We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how . 
He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say `` Your Grace , '' or `` My Lord , '' or `` Your Lordship '' -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain `` Bridgewater , '' which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done . 
Well , that was all easy , so we done it . 
All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him , and says , `` Will yo ' Grace have some o ' dis or some o ' dat ? '' 
and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him . 
But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke . 
He seemed to have something on his mind .
