-- then stopped . 
` Here , ' I said , ` is an outcast like myself . 
This is the man for me . ' 
So I turned back and came to you -- you . 
And -- '' `` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But I 'm all in a tizzy . 
May I ask -- How is it ? 
And what you may be requiring in the way of help ? 
-- Invisible ! '' 
`` I want you to help me get clothes -- and shelter -- and then , with other things . 
I 've left them long enough . 
If you wo n't -- well ! 
But you will -- must . '' 
`` Look here , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I 'm too flabbergasted . 
Do n't knock me about any more . 
And leave me go . 
I must get steady a bit . 
And you 've pretty near broken my toe . 
It 's all so unreasonable . 
Empty downs , empty sky . 
Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature . 
And then comes a voice . 
A voice out of heaven ! 
And stones ! 
And a fist -- Lord ! '' 
`` Pull yourself together , '' said the Voice , `` for you have to do the job I 've chosen for you . '' 
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks , and his eyes were round . 
`` I 've chosen you , '' said the Voice . 
`` You are the only man except some of those fools down there , who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man . 
You have to be my helper . 
Help me -- and I will do great things for you . 
An invisible man is a man of power . '' 
He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently . 
`` But if you betray me , '' he said , `` if you fail to do as I direct you -- '' He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel 's shoulder smartly . 
Mr. Marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch . 
`` I do n't want to betray you , '' said Mr. Marvel , edging away from the direction of the fingers . 
`` Do n't you go a-thinking that , whatever you do . 
All I want to do is to help you -- just tell me what I got to do . 
-LRB- Lord ! -RRB- 
Whatever you want done , that I 'm most willing to do . '' 
MR. MARVEL 'S VISIT TO IPING After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative . 
Scepticism suddenly reared its head -- rather nervous scepticism , not at all assured of its back , but scepticism nevertheless . 
It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man ; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air , or felt the strength of his arm , could be counted on the fingers of two hands . 
And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing , having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house , and Jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller , more tangible considerations . 
Iping was gay with bunting , and everybody was in gala dress . 
Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or more . 
By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion , on the supposition that he had quite gone away , and with the sceptics he was already a jest .
