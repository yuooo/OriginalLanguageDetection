`` Let me have a stick or something , and I 'll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on . 
That ought to settle him ! 
They 're hard by -- not ten minutes -- '' Another window went the way of its fellows . 
`` You have n't a revolver ? '' 
asked Adye . 
Kemp 's hand went to his pocket . 
Then he hesitated . 
`` I have n't one -- at least to spare . '' 
`` I 'll bring it back , '' said Adye , `` you 'll be safe here . '' 
Kemp , ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness , handed him the weapon . 
`` Now for the door , '' said Adye . 
As they stood hesitating in the hall , they heard one of the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash . 
Kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible . 
His face was a little paler than usual . 
`` You must step straight out , '' said Kemp . 
In another moment Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples . 
He hesitated for a moment , feeling more comfortable with his back against the door . 
Then he marched , upright and square , down the steps . 
He crossed the lawn and approached the gate . 
A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass . 
Something moved near him . 
`` Stop a bit , '' said a Voice , and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Adye , white and grim , and every nerve tense . 
`` Oblige me by going back to the house , '' said the Voice , as tense and grim as Adye 's . 
`` Sorry , '' said Adye a little hoarsely , and moistened his lips with his tongue . 
The Voice was on his left front , he thought . 
Suppose he were to take his luck with a shot ? 
`` What are you going for ? '' 
said the Voice , and there was a quick movement of the two , and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of Adye 's pocket . 
Adye desisted and thought . 
`` Where I go , '' he said slowly , `` is my own business . '' 
The words were still on his lips , when an arm came round his neck , his back felt a knee , and he was sprawling backward . 
He drew clumsily and fired absurdly , and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip . 
He made a vain clutch at a slippery limb , tried to struggle up and fell back . 
`` Damn ! '' 
said Adye . 
The Voice laughed . 
`` I 'd kill you now if it was n't the waste of a bullet , '' it said . 
He saw the revolver in mid-air , six feet off , covering him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Adye , sitting up . 
`` Get up , '' said the Voice . 
Adye stood up . 
`` Attention , '' said the Voice , and then fiercely , `` Do n't try any games . 
Remember I can see your face if you ca n't see mine . 
You 've got to go back to the house . '' 
`` He wo n't let me in , '' said Adye . 
`` That 's a pity , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` I 've got no quarrel with you . ''
