She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her . 
I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still . 
I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could . 
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river . 
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off . 
By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people . 
BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars . 
We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives . 
The seegars was prime . 
We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time . 
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he did n't want no more adventures . 
He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure . 
Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger . 
I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , ` stead of mister ; and Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he was interested . 
He says : `` I didn ' know dey was so many un um . 
I hai n't hearn ` bout none un um , skasely , but ole King Sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er k ` yards . 
How much do a king git ? '' 
`` Get ? '' 
I says ; `` why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them . '' 
`` AIN ' dat gay ? 
En what dey got to do , Huck ? '' 
`` THEY do n't do nothing ! 
Why , how you talk ! 
They just set around . '' 
`` No ; is dat so ? '' 
`` Of course it is . 
They just set around -- except , maybe , when there 's a war ; then they go to the war . 
But other times they just lazy around ; or go hawking -- just hawking and sp -- Sh ! 
-- d' you hear a noise ? '' 
We skipped out and looked ; but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back . 
`` Yes , '' says I , `` and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody do n't go just so he whacks their heads off . 
But mostly they hang round the harem . '' 
`` Roun ' de which ? '' 
`` Harem . '' 
`` What 's de harem ? '' 
`` The place where he keeps his wives . 
Do n't you know about the harem ? 
Solomon had one ; he had about a million wives . '' 
`` Why , yes , dat 's so ; I -- I 'd done forgot it . 
A harem 's a bo 'd ` n-house , I reck ` n. Mos ' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery . 
En I reck 'n de wives quarrels considable ; en dat ` crease de racket . 
Yit dey say Sollermun de wises ' man dat ever live ' . 
I doan ' take no stock in dat . 
Bekase why : would a wise man want to live in de mids ' er sich a blim - blammin ' all de time ? 
No -- ` deed he would n't . 
A wise man ` ud take en buil ' a biler-factry ; en den he could shet DOWN de biler-factry when he want to res ' . '' 
`` Well , but he WAS the wisest man , anyway ; because the widow she told me so , her own self . '' 
`` I doan k ` yer what de widder say , he WAR N'T no wise man nuther . 
He had some er de dad-fetchedes ' ways I ever see . 
Does you know ` bout dat chile dat he ` uz gwyne to chop in two ? ''
