`` I processed her . 
But giving drugs to a cat is no joke , Kemp ! 
And the process failed . '' 
`` Failed ! '' 
`` In two particulars . 
These were the claws and the pigment stuff , what is it ? 
-- at the back of the eye in a cat . 
You know ? '' 
`` Tapetum . '' 
`` Yes , the tapetum . 
It did n't go . 
After I 'd given the stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her , I gave the beast opium , and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on , on the apparatus . 
And after all the rest had faded and vanished , there remained two little ghosts of her eyes . '' 
`` Odd ! '' 
`` I ca n't explain it . 
She was bandaged and clamped , of course -- so I had her safe ; but she woke while she was still misty , and miaowed dismally , and someone came knocking . 
It was an old woman from downstairs , who suspected me of vivisecting -- a drink-sodden old creature , with only a white cat to care for in all the world . 
I whipped out some chloroform , applied it , and answered the door . 
` Did I hear a cat ? ' 
she asked . 
` My cat ? ' 
` Not here , ' said I , very politely . 
She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room ; strange enough to her no doubt -- bare walls , uncurtained windows , truckle-bed , with the gas engine vibrating , and the seethe of the radiant points , and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air . 
She had to be satisfied at last and went away again . '' 
`` How long did it take ? '' 
asked Kemp . 
`` Three or four hours -- the cat . 
The bones and sinews and the fat were the last to go , and the tips of the coloured hairs . 
And , as I say , the back part of the eye , tough , iridescent stuff it is , would n't go at all . 
`` It was night outside long before the business was over , and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws . 
I stopped the gas engine , felt for and stroked the beast , which was still insensible , and then , being tired , left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed . 
I found it hard to sleep . 
I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff , going over the experiment over and over again , or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me , until everything , the ground I stood on , vanished , and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets . 
About two , the cat began miaowing about the room . 
I tried to hush it by talking to it , and then I decided to turn it out . 
I remember the shock I had when striking a light -- there were just the round eyes shining green -- and nothing round them . 
I would have given it milk , but I had n't any . 
It would n't be quiet , it just sat down and miaowed at the door . 
I tried to catch it , with an idea of putting it out of the window , but it would n't be caught , it vanished . 
Then it began miaowing in different parts of the room . 
At last I opened the window and made a bustle . 
I suppose it went out at last . 
I never saw any more of it . 
`` Then -- Heaven knows why -- I fell thinking of my father 's funeral again , and the dismal windy hillside , until the day had come . 
I found sleeping was hopeless , and , locking my door after me , wandered out into the morning streets . '' 
`` You do n't mean to say there 's an invisible cat at large ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` If it has n't been killed , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Why not ? ''
