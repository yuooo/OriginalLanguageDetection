Well , he was at home , and asked the devil what he wanted . 
The devil , switching his hoofs , up and says , ' I want John . ' 
` What for ? ' 
says the old governor . 
` What business is that of yours , ' says the devil , getting mad , -- ' I want to use him . ' 
` Take him , ' says the governor -- and by the Lord , Flask , if the devil did n't give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him , I 'll eat this whale in one mouthful . 
But look sharp -- ai n't you all ready there ? 
Well , then , pull ahead , and let 's get the whale alongside . '' 
`` I think I remember some such story as you were telling , '' said Flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , `` but I ca n't remember where . '' 
`` Three Spaniards ? 
Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes ? 
Did ye read it there , Flask ? 
I guess ye did ? '' 
`` No : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though . 
But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ? '' 
`` Am I the same man that helped kill this whale ? 
Does n't the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ? 
Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ? 
And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral 's cabin , do n't you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ? 
Tell me that , Mr. Flask ? '' 
`` How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ? '' 
`` Do you see that mainmast there ? '' 
pointing to the ship ; `` well , that 's the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod 's hold , and string 'em along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that would n't begin to be Fedallah 's age . 
Nor all the coopers in creation could n't show hoops enough to make oughts enough . '' 
`` But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss , if you got a good chance . 
Now , if he 's so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ? 
`` Give him a good ducking , anyhow . '' 
`` But he 'd crawl back . '' 
`` Duck him again ; and keep ducking him . '' 
`` Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ? '' 
`` I should like to see him try it ; I 'd give him such a pair of black eyes that he would n't dare to show his face in the admiral 's cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the orlop there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much . 
Damn the devil , Flask ; do you suppose I 'm afraid of the devil ? 
Who 's afraid of him , except the old governor who dares n't catch him and put him in double-darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he 'd roast for him ? 
There 's a governor ! '' 
`` Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab ? '' 
`` Do I suppose it ? 
You 'll know it before long , Flask . 
But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him ; and if I see anything very suspicious going on , I 'll just take him by the nape of his neck , and say -- Look here , Beelzebub , you do n't do it ; and if he makes any fuss , by the Lord I 'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail , take it to the capstan , and give him such a wrenching and heaving , that his tail will come short off at the stump -- do you see ; and then , I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion , he 'll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs . '' 
`` And what will you do with the tail , Stubb ? '' 
`` Do with it ? 
Sell it for an ox whip when we get home ; -- what else ? '' 
`` Now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , Stubb ? '' 
`` Mean or not mean , here we are at the ship . '' 
The boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him . 
`` Did n't I tell you so ? '' 
said Flask ; `` yes , you 'll soon see this right whale 's head hoisted up opposite that parmacety 's . '' 
In good time , Flask 's saying proved true . 
As before , the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale 's head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her even keel ; though sorely strained , you may well believe . 
So , when on one side you hoist in Locke 's head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in Kant 's and you come back again ; but in very poor plight . 
Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat .
