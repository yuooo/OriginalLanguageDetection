Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year ? 
He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot . 
`` The weather -- '' he began . 
`` Why do n't you finish and go ? '' 
said the rigid figure , evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage . 
`` All you 've got to do is to fix the hour-hand on its axle . 
You 're simply humbugging -- '' `` Certainly , sir -- one minute more . 
I overlooked -- '' and Mr. Henfrey finished and went . 
But he went feeling excessively annoyed . 
`` Damn it ! '' 
said Mr. Henfrey to himself , trudging down the village through the thawing snow ; `` a man must do a clock at times , sure-ly . '' 
And again `` Ca n't a man look at you ? 
-- Ugly ! '' 
And yet again , `` Seemingly not . 
If the police was wanting you you could n't be more wropped and bandaged . '' 
At Gleeson 's corner he saw Hall , who had recently married the stranger 's hostess at the `` Coach and Horses , '' and who now drove the Iping conveyance , when occasional people required it , to Sidderbridge Junction , coming towards him on his return from that place . 
Hall had evidently been `` stopping a bit '' at Sidderbridge , to judge by his driving . '' 
` Ow do , Teddy ? '' 
he said , passing . 
`` You got a rum un up home ! '' 
said Teddy . 
Hall very sociably pulled up . 
`` What 's that ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Rum-looking customer stopping at the ` Coach and Horses , ' '' said Teddy . 
`` My sakes ! '' 
And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest . 
`` Looks a bit like a disguise , do n't it ? 
I 'd like to see a man 's face if I had him stopping in my place , '' said Henfrey . 
`` But women are that trustful -- where strangers are concerned . 
He 's took your rooms and he ai n't even given a name , Hall . '' 
`` You do n't say so ! '' 
said Hall , who was a man of sluggish apprehension . 
`` Yes , '' said Teddy . 
`` By the week . 
Whatever he is , you ca n't get rid of him under the week . 
And he 's got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow , so he says . 
Let 's hope it wo n't be stones in boxes , Hall . '' 
He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux . 
Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious . 
`` Get up , old girl , '' said Hall . 
`` I s ` pose I must see ` bout this . '' 
Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved . 
Instead of `` seeing ` bout it , '' however , Hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge , and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point . 
But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements . 
`` You wim ' do n't know everything , '' said Mr. Hall , resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity . 
And after the stranger had gone to bed , which he did about half-past nine , Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife 's furniture , just to show that the stranger was n't master there , and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left . 
When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger 's luggage when it came next day . 
`` You mind you own business , Hall , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` and I 'll mind mine . '' 
She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger , and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind .
