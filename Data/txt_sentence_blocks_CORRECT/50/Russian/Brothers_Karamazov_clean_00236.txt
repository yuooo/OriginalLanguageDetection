He waited two minutes . 
His heart was beating violently , and , at moments , he could scarcely breathe . 
`` No , this throbbing at my heart wo n't stop , '' he thought . 
`` I ca n't wait any longer . '' 
He was standing behind a bush in the shadow . 
The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush . 
`` How red the whitebeam berries are ! '' 
he murmured , not knowing why . 
Softly and noiselessly , step by step , he approached the window , and raised himself on tiptoe . 
All Fyodor Pavlovitch 's bedroom lay open before him . 
It was not a large room , and was divided in two parts by a red screen , `` Chinese , '' as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it . 
The word `` Chinese '' flashed into Mitya 's mind , `` and behind the screen , is Grushenka , '' thought Mitya . 
He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch who was wearing his new striped-silk dressing-gown , which Mitya had never seen , and a silk cord with tassels round the waist . 
A clean , dandified shirt of fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown . 
On his head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen . 
`` He has got himself up , '' thought Mitya . 
His father was standing near the window , apparently lost in thought . 
Suddenly he jerked up his head , listened a moment , and hearing nothing went up to the table , poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter and drank it off . 
Then he uttered a deep sigh , again stood still a moment , walked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall , with his right hand raised the red bandage on his forehead a little , and began examining his bruises and scars , which had not yet disappeared . 
`` He 's alone , '' thought Mitya , `` in all probability he 's alone . '' 
Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass , turned suddenly to the window and looked out . 
Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow . 
`` She may be there behind the screen . 
Perhaps she 's asleep by now , '' he thought , with a pang at his heart . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the window . 
`` He 's looking for her out of the window , so she 's not there . 
Why should he stare out into the dark ? 
He 's wild with impatience . '' 
... Mitya slipped back at once , and fell to gazing in at the window again . 
The old man was sitting down at the table , apparently disappointed . 
At last he put his elbow on the table , and laid his right cheek against his hand . 
Mitya watched him eagerly . 
`` He 's alone , he 's alone ! '' 
he repeated again . 
`` If she were here , his face would be different . '' 
Strange to say , a queer , irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she was not here . 
`` It 's not that she 's not here , '' he explained to himself , immediately , `` but that I ca n't tell for certain whether she is or not . '' 
Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally clear , that he took in everything to the slightest detail , and missed no point . 
But a feeling of misery , the misery of uncertainty and indecision , was growing in his heart with every instant . 
`` Is she here or not ? '' 
The angry doubt filled his heart , and suddenly , making up his mind , he put out his hand and softly knocked on the window frame . 
He knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov , twice slowly and then three times more quickly , the signal that meant `` Grushenka is here ! '' 
The old man started , jerked up his head , and , jumping up quickly , ran to the window . 
Mitya slipped away into the shadow . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch opened the window and thrust his whole head out . 
`` Grushenka , is it you ? 
Is it you ? '' 
he said , in a sort of trembling half-whisper . 
`` Where are you , my angel , where are you ? '' 
He was fearfully agitated and breathless .
