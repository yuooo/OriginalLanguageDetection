This question suddenly presented itself to her , and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief . 
And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he , but something mysterious and horrible , seized her again . 
She tried to think of something else and to pray , but could do neither . 
With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows , expecting every moment to see his dead face , and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast . 
`` Dunyasha , '' she whispered . 
`` Dunyasha ! '' 
she screamed wildly , and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants ' quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her . 
On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin , accompanied by Lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly , left their quarters at Yankovo , ten miles from Bogucharovo , and went for a ride -- to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages . 
For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies , so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as for the French vanguard ; Rostov , as a careful squadron commander , wished to take such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo before the French could get them . 
Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods . 
On the way to Bogucharovo , a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls , they questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories , and raced one another to try Ilyin 's horse . 
Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister . 
Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching Bogucharovo , and Rostov , outstripping Ilyin , was the first to gallop into the village street . 
`` You 're first ! '' 
cried Ilyin , flushed . 
`` Yes , always first both on the grassland and here , '' answered Rostov , stroking his heated Donets horse . 
`` And I 'd have won on my Frenchy , your excellency , '' said Lavrushka from behind , alluding to his shabby cart horse , `` only I did n't wish to mortify you . '' 
They rode at a footpace to the barn , where a large crowd of peasants was standing . 
Some of the men bared their heads , others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps . 
Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern , smiling , staggering , and singing some incoherent song , and approached the officers . 
`` Fine fellows ! '' 
said Rostov laughing . 
`` Is there any hay here ? '' 
`` And how like one another , '' said Ilyin . 
`` A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa ... ! '' 
sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile . 
One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov . 
`` Who do you belong to ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The French , '' replied Ilyin jestingly , `` and here is Napoleon himself '' -- and he pointed to Lavrushka . 
`` Then you are Russians ? '' 
the peasant asked again . 
`` And is there a large force of you here ? '' 
said another , a short man , coming up . 
`` Very large , '' answered Rostov . 
`` But why have you collected here ? '' 
he added . 
`` Is it a holiday ? '' 
`` The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune , '' replied the peasant , moving away . 
At that moment , on the road leading from the big house , two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers . 
`` The one in pink is mine , so keep off ! '' 
said Ilyin on seeing Dunyasha running resolutely toward him . 
`` She 'll be ours ! '' 
said Lavrushka to Ilyin , winking . 
`` What do you want , my pretty ? '' 
said Ilyin with a smile . 
`` The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name . '' 
`` This is Count Rostov , squadron commander , and I am your humble servant . '' 
`` Co-o-om-pa-ny ! '' 
roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl .
