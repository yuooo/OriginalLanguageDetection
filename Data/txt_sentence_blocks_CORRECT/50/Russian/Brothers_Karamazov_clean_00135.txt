`` Sure ? 
Upon my word ! 
She put aside his hand , but did not leave go of it , blushing hotly , and laughing a little happy laugh . 
`` I kiss his hand and he says , ` What a good thing ! ' '' 
But her reproach was undeserved . 
Alyosha , too , was greatly overcome . 
`` I should like to please you always , Lise , but do n't know how to do it . '' 
he muttered , blushing too . 
`` Alyosha , dear , you are cold and rude . 
Do you see ? 
He has chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it . 
He is sure I was in earnest . 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , that 's impertinence - that 's what it is . '' 
`` Why , was it wrong of me to feel sure ? '' 
Alyosha asked , laughing suddenly . 
`` Ah , Alyosha , on the contrary , it was delightfully right , '' cried Lise , looking tenderly and happily at him . 
Alyosha stood still , holding her hand in his . 
Suddenly he stooped down and kissed her on her lips . 
`` Oh , what are you doing ? '' 
cried Lise . 
Alyosha was terribly abashed . 
`` Oh , forgive me if I should n't ... . 
Perhaps I 'm awfully stupid ... . 
You said I was cold , so I kissed you ... . 
But I see it was stupid . '' 
Lise laughed , and hid her face in her hands . 
`` And in that dress ! '' 
she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth . 
But she suddenly ceased laughing and became serious , almost stern . 
`` Alyosha , we must put off kissing . 
We are not ready for that yet , and we shall have a long time to wait , '' she ended suddenly . 
`` Tell me rather why you who are so clever , so intellectual , so observant , choose a little idiot , an invalid like me ? 
Ah , Alyosha , I am awfully happy , for I do n't deserve you a bit . '' 
`` You do , Lise . 
I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days . 
If I go into the world , I must marry . 
I know that . 
He told me to marry , too . 
Whom could I marry better than you - and who would have me except you ? 
I have been thinking it over . 
In the first place , you 've known me from a child and you 've a great many qualities I have n't . 
You are more light-hearted than I am ; above all , you are more innocent than I am . 
I have been brought into contact with many , many things already ... . 
Ah , you do n't know , but I , too , am a Karamazov . 
What does it matter if you do laugh and make jokes , and at me , too ? 
Go on laughing . 
I am so glad you do . 
You laugh like a little child , but you think like a martyr . '' 
`` Like a martyr ?
