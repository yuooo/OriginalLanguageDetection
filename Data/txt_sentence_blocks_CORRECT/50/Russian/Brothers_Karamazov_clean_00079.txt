Ivan , do you love Alyosha ? '' 
`` You must love him '' -LRB- Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk -RRB- . 
`` Listen , Alyosha , I was rude to your elder this morning . 
But I was excited . 
But there 's wit in that elder , do n't you think , Ivan ? '' 
`` Very likely . '' 
`` There is , there is . 
Il y a du Piron la-dedans . 
* He 's a Jesuit , a Russian one , that is . 
As he 's an honourable person there 's a hidden indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness . '' 
* There 's something of Piron inside of him . 
`` But , of course , he believes in God . '' 
`` Not a bit of it . 
Did n't you know ? 
Why , he tells everyone so , himself . 
That is , not everyone , but all the clever people who come to him . 
He said straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago : ` Credo , but I do n't know in what . ' '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` He really did . 
But I respect him . 
There 's something of Mephistopheles about him , or rather of ` The hero of our time ' ... Arbenin , or what 's his name ? 
... You see , he 's a sensualist . 
He 's such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him . 
You know , when he begins telling stories ... The year before last he invited us to tea , tea with liqueur -LRB- the ladies send him liqueur -RRB- , and began telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides ... . 
Especially how he once cured a paralysed woman . 
` If my legs were not bad I know a dance I could dance you , ' he said . 
What do you say to that ? 
` I 've plenty of tricks in my time , ' said he . 
He did Demidov , the merchant , out of sixty thousand . '' 
`` What , he stole it ? '' 
`` He brought him the money as a man he could trust , saying , ` Take care of it for me , friend , there 'll be a police search at my place to-morrow . ' 
And he kept it . 
` You have given it to the Church , ' he declared . 
I said to him : ` You 're a scoundrel , ' I said . 
` No , ' said he , ` I 'm not a scoundrel , but I 'm broadminded . ' 
But that was n't he , that was someone else . 
I 've muddled him with someone else ... without noticing it . 
Come , another glass and that 's enough . 
Take away the bottle , Ivan . 
I 've been telling lies . 
Why did n't you stop me , Ivan , and tell me I was lying ? '' 
`` I knew you 'd stop of yourself . '' 
`` That 's a lie . 
You did it from spite , from simple spite against me . 
You despise me . 
You have come to me and despised me in my own house . '' 
`` Well , I 'm going away . 
You 've had too much brandy . '' 
`` I 've begged you for Christ 's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two , and you do n't go . '' 
`` I 'll go to-morrow if you 're so set upon it . ''
