`` That is perfectly true . 
And I am sorry I went to see him and took her , '' said the old count . 
`` No , why be sorry ? 
Being here , you had to pay your respects . 
But if he wo n't -- that 's his affair , '' said Marya Dmitrievna , looking for something in her reticule . 
`` Besides , the trousseau is ready , so there is nothing to wait for ; and what is not ready I 'll send after you . 
Though I do n't like letting you go , it is the best way . 
So go , with God 's blessing ! '' 
Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to Natasha . 
It was a letter from Princess Mary . 
`` She has written to you . 
How she torments herself , poor thing ! 
She 's afraid you might think that she does not like you . '' 
`` But she does n't like me , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense ! '' 
cried Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` I sha n't believe anyone , I know she does n't like me , '' replied Natasha boldly as she took the letter , and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown . 
`` Do n't answer like that , my good girl ! '' 
she said . 
`` What I say is true ! 
Write an answer ! '' 
Natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary 's letter . 
Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them . 
Whatever her father 's feelings might be , she begged Natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother , for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything . 
`` Do not think , however , '' she wrote , `` that my father is ill-disposed toward you . 
He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven ; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy . '' 
Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time when she could see her again . 
After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it . 
`` Dear Princess , '' she wrote in French quickly and mechanically , and then paused . 
What more could she write after all that had happened the evening before ? 
`` Yes , yes ! 
All that has happened , and now all is changed , '' she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her . 
`` Must I break off with him ? 
Must I really ? 
That 's awful ... '' and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her . 
After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary 's letter . 
`` Can it be that it is all over ? '' 
she thought . 
`` Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before ? '' 
She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength , and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin . 
She vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew 's wife , and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination , and at the same time , aglow with excitement , recalled every detail of yesterday 's interview with Anatole . 
`` Why could that not be as well ? '' 
she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment . 
`` Only so could I be completely happy ; but now I have to choose , and I ca n't be happy without either of them . 
Only , '' she thought , `` to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible . 
But with that one nothing is spoiled . 
But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew 's love , in which I have lived so long ? '' 
`` Please , Miss ! '' 
whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air . 
`` A man told me to give you this - '' and she handed Natasha a letter .
