Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery . 
Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Natasha , her father 's pet , having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room , ran to her father unobserved by her mother . 
The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door , went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs , and having examined the position of her father , who was asleep with his back to her , rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head . 
Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face . 
`` Natasha , Natasha ! '' 
came Countess Mary 's frightened whisper from the door . 
`` Papa wants to sleep . '' 
`` No , Mamma , he does n't want to sleep , '' said little Natasha with conviction . 
`` He 's laughing . '' 
Nicholas lowered his legs , rose , and took his daughter in his arms . 
`` Come in , Mary , '' he said to his wife . 
She went in and sat down by her husband . 
`` I did not notice him following me , '' she said timidly . 
`` I just looked in . '' 
Holding his little girl with one arm , Nicholas glanced at his wife and , seeing her guilty expression , put his other arm around her and kissed her hair . 
`` May I kiss Mamma ? '' 
he asked Natasha . 
Natasha smiled bashfully . 
`` Again ! '' 
she commanded , pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where Nicholas had placed the kiss . 
`` I do n't know why you think I am cross , '' said Nicholas , replying to the question he knew was in his wife 's mind . 
`` You have no idea how unhappy , how lonely , I feel when you are like that . 
It always seems to me ... '' `` Mary , do n't talk nonsense . 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! '' 
he said gaily . 
`` It seems to be that you ca n't love me , that I am so plain ... always ... and now ... in this cond ... '' `` Oh , how absurd you are ! 
It is not beauty that endears , it 's love that makes us see beauty . 
It is only Malvinas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty . 
But do I love my wife ? 
I do n't love her , but ... I do n't know how to put it . 
Without you , or when something comes between us like this , I seem lost and ca n't do anything . 
Now do I love my finger ? 
I do n't love it , but just try to cut it off ! '' 
`` I 'm not like that myself , but I understand . 
So you 're not angry with me ? '' 
`` Awfully angry ! '' 
he said , smiling and getting up . 
And smoothing his hair he began to pace the room . 
`` Do you know , Mary , what I 've been thinking ? '' 
he began , immediately thinking aloud in his wife 's presence now that they had made it up . 
He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him . 
He did not care . 
A thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also . 
And he told her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring . 
Countess Mary listened till he had finished , made some remark , and in her turn began thinking aloud . 
Her thoughts were about the children . 
`` You can see the woman in her already , '' she said in French , pointing to little Natasha . 
`` You reproach us women with being illogical . 
Here is our logic . 
I say : ` Papa wants to sleep ! '
