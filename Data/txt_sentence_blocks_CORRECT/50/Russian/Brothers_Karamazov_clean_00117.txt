She rushed impulsively at Ivan , and seizing both his hands , pressed them warmly . 
`` But what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position . 
You can speak with complete openness to Agafya , but spare dear auntie . 
You will know how to do that . 
You ca n't think how wretched I was yesterday and this morning , wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter - for one can never tell such things in a letter ... Now it will be easy for me to write , for you will see them and explain everything . 
Oh , how glad I am ! 
But I am only glad of that , believe me . 
Of course , no one can take your place ... . 
I will run at once to write the letter , '' she finished suddenly , and took a step as though to go out of the room . 
`` And what about Alyosha and his opinion , which you were so desperately anxious to hear ? '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
There was a sarcastic , angry note in her voice . 
`` I had not forgotten that , '' cried Katerina Ivanovna , coming to a sudden standstill , `` and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment ? '' 
she added , with warm and bitter reproachfulness . 
`` What I said , I repeat . 
I must have his opinion . 
More than that , I must have his decision ! 
As he says , so it shall be . 
You see how anxious I am for your words , Alexey Fyodorovitch ... But what 's the matter ? '' 
`` I could n't have believed it . 
I ca n't understand it ! '' 
Alyosha cried suddenly in distress . 
`` He is going to Moscow , and you cry out that you are glad . 
You said that on purpose ! 
And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but sorry to be - losing a friend . 
But that was acting , too - you were playing a part as in a theatre ! '' 
`` In a theatre ? 
What ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna , profoundly astonished , flushing crimson , and frowning . 
`` Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him , you persist in telling him to his face that it 's fortunate he is going , '' said Alyosha breathlessly . 
He was standing at the table and did not sit down . 
`` What are you talking about ? 
I do n't understand . '' 
`` I do n't understand myself ... . 
I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I am not saying it properly , but I 'll say it all the same , '' Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice . 
`` What I see is that perhaps you do n't love Dmitri at all ... and never have , from the beginning ... . 
And Dmitri , too , has never loved you ... and only esteems you ... . 
I really do n't know how I dare to say all this , but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody here will tell the truth . '' 
`` What truth ? '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , and there was an hysterical ring in her voice . 
`` I 'll tell you , '' Alyosha went on with desperate haste , as though he were jumping from the top of a house . 
`` Call Dmitri ; I will fetch him and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan 's and join your hands . 
For you 're torturing Ivan , simply because you love him - and torturing him , because you love Dmitri through ` self-laceration ' - with an unreal love - because you 've persuaded yourself . '' 
Alyosha broke off and was silent . 
`` You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot - that 's what you are ! '' 
Katerina Ivanovna snapped . 
Her face was white and her lips were moving with anger . 
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up . 
His hat was in his hand .
