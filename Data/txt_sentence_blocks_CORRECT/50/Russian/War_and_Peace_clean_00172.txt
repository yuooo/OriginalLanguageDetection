I must have singers too . 
I shall have my own orchestra , but should n't we get the gypsy singers as well ? 
You military men like that sort of thing . '' 
`` Really , Papa , I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less before the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now , '' said his son with a smile . 
The old count pretended to be angry . 
`` Yes , you talk , but try it yourself ! '' 
And the count turned to the cook , who , with a shrewd and respectful expression , looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son . 
`` What have the young people come to nowadays , eh , Feoktist ? '' 
said he . 
`` Laughing at us old fellows ! '' 
`` That 's so , your excellency , all they have to do is to eat a good dinner , but providing it and serving it all up , that 's not their business ! '' 
`` That 's it , that 's it ! '' 
exclaimed the count , and gaily seizing his son by both hands , he cried , `` Now I 've got you , so take the sleigh and pair at once , and go to Bezukhob 's , and tell him ` Count Ilya has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples . ' 
We ca n't get them from anyone else . 
He 's not there himself , so you 'll have to go in and ask the princesses ; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay -- the coachman Ipatka knows -- and look up the gypsy Ilyushka , the one who danced at Count Orlov 's , you remember , in a white Cossack coat , and bring him along to me . '' 
`` And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him ? '' 
asked Nicholas , laughing . 
`` Dear , dear ! 
... '' At that moment , with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike , preoccupied , yet meekly Christian look which never left her face , Anna Mikhaylovna entered the hall . 
Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day , he invariably became confused and begged her to excuse his costume . 
`` No matter at all , my dear count , '' she said , meekly closing her eyes . 
`` But I 'll go to Bezukhov 's myself . 
Pierre has arrived , and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses . 
I have to see him in any case . 
He has forwarded me a letter from Boris . 
Thank God , Boris is now on the staff . '' 
The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna 's taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her . 
`` Tell Bezukhov to come . 
I 'll put his name down . 
Is his wife with him ? '' 
he asked . 
Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes , and profound sadness was depicted on her face . 
`` Ah , my dear friend , he is very unfortunate , '' she said . 
`` If what we hear is true , it is dreadful . 
How little we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness ! 
And such a lofty angelic soul as young Bezukhov ! 
Yes , I pity him from my heart , and shall try to give him what consolation I can . '' 
`` Wh-what is the matter ? '' 
asked both the young and old Rostov . 
Anna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply . 
`` Dolokhov , Mary Ivanovna 's son , '' she said in a mysterious whisper , `` has compromised her completely , they say . 
Pierre took him up , invited him to his house in Petersburg , and now ... she has come here and that daredevil after her ! '' 
said Anna Mikhaylovna , wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre , but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the `` daredevil , '' as she called Dolokhov . 
`` They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune . '' 
`` Dear , dear ! 
But still tell him to come to the Club -- it will all blow over . 
It will be a tremendous banquet . '' 
Next day , the third of March , soon after one o'clock , two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign , Prince Bagration , to dinner . 
On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz , Moscow had been bewildered . 
At that time , the Russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it , while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event .
