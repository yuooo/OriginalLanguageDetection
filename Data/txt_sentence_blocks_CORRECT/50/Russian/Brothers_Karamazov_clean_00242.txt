Mitya , in desperate haste , scarcely soaped his hands -LRB- they were trembling , and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards -RRB- . 
But the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more . 
He seemed to exercise more and more sway over Mitya , as time went on . 
It may be noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character . 
`` Look , you have n't got your nails clean . 
Now rub your face ; here , on your temples , by your ear ... . 
Will you go in that shirt ? 
Where are you going ? 
Look , all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood . '' 
`` Yes , it 's all bloody , '' observed Mitya , looking at the cuff of his shirt . 
`` Then change your shirt . '' 
`` I have n't time . 
You see I 'll ... '' Mitya went on with the same confiding ingenuousness , drying his face and hands on the towel , and putting on his coat . 
`` I 'll turn it up at the wrist . 
It wo n't be seen under the coat ... . 
You see ! '' 
`` Tell me now , what game have you been up to ? 
Have you been fighting with someone ? 
In the tavern again , as before ? 
Have you been beating that captain again ? '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully . 
`` Whom have you been beating now ... or killing , perhaps ? '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
said Mitya . 
`` Do n't worry , '' said Mitya , and he suddenly laughed . 
`` I smashed an old woman in the market-place just now . '' 
`` Smashed ? 
An old woman ? '' 
`` An old man ! '' 
cried Mitya , looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face , laughing , and shouting at him as though he were deaf . 
`` Confound it ! 
An old woman , an old man ... . 
Have you killed someone ? '' 
`` We made it up . 
We had a row - and made it up . 
In a place I know of . 
We parted friends . 
A fool ... . 
He 's forgiven me ... . 
He 's sure to have forgiven me by now ... if he had got up , he would n't have forgiven me '' - Mitya suddenly winked - `` only damn him , you know , I say , Pyotr Ilyitch , damn him ! 
Do n't worry about him ! 
I do n't want to just now ! '' 
Mitya snapped out , resolutely . 
`` Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with everyone for ? 
... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense ... . 
You 've been fighting and now you 're rushing off on the spree - that 's you all over ! 
Three dozen champagne - what do you want all that for ? '' 
`` Bravo ! 
Now give me the pistols . 
Upon my honour I 've no time now .
