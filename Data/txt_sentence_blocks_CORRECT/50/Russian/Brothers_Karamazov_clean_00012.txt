It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected , and that they were not received with special honour , though one of them had recently made a donation of a thousand roubles , while another was a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner , upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense dependent , as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands . 
Yet no official personage met them . 
Miusov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church , and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this `` holy place , '' but refrained . 
His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger . 
`` Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place ? 
We must find out , for time is passing , '' he observed suddenly , as though speaking to himself . 
All at once there came up a bald-headed , elderly man with ingratiating little eyes , wearing a full , summer overcoat . 
Lifting his hat , he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov , a landowner of Tula . 
He at once entered into our visitors ' difficulty . 
`` Father Zossima lives in the hermitage , apart , four hundred paces from the monastery , the other side of the copse . '' 
`` I know it 's the other side of the copse , '' observed Fyodor Pavlovitch , `` but we do n't remember the way . 
It is a long time since we 've been here . '' 
`` This way , by this gate , and straight across the copse ... the copse . 
Come with me , wo n't you ? 
I 'll show you . 
I have to go ... . 
I am going myself . 
This way , this way . '' 
They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse . 
Maximov , a man of sixty , ran rather than walked , turning sideways to stare at them all , with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity . 
His eyes looked starting out of his head . 
`` You see , we have come to the elder upon business of our own , '' observed Miusov severely . 
`` That personage has granted us an audience , so to speak , and so , though we thank you for showing us the way , we can not ask you to accompany us . '' 
`` I 've been there . 
I 've been already ; un chevalier parfait , '' and Maximov snapped his fingers in the air . 
`` Who is a chevalier ? '' 
asked Miusov . 
`` The elder , the splendid elder , the elder ! 
The honour and glory of the monastery , Zossima . 
Such an elder ! '' 
But his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale , wan-looking monk of medium height wearing a monk 's cap , who overtook them . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch and Miusov stopped . 
The monk , with an extremely courteous , profound bow , announced : `` The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after your visit to the hermitage . 
At one o'clock , not later . 
And you also , '' he added , addressing Maximov . 
`` That I certainly will , without fail , '' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , hugely delighted at the invitation . 
`` And , believe me , we 've all given our word to behave properly here ... . 
And you , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , will you go , too ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . 
What have I come for but to study all the customs here ? 
The only obstacle to me is your company ... '' `` Yes , Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet . '' 
`` It would be a capital thing if he did n't turn up . 
Do you suppose I like all this business , and in your company , too ? 
So we will come to dinner . 
Thank the Father Superior , '' he said to the monk . 
`` No , it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder , '' answered the monk . 
`` If so I 'll go straight to the Father Superior - to the Father Superior , '' babbled Maximov . 
`` The Father Superior is engaged just now . 
But as you please - '' the monk hesitated . 
`` Impertinent old man ! ''
