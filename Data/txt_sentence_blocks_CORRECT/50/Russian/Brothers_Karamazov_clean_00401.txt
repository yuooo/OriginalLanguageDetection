Where can one sit down ? '' 
He went to the other end of the table , moved up a chair and sat down on it . 
`` Why do you look at me without speaking ? 
We only come with one question , and I swear I wo n't go without an answer . 
Has the young lady , Katerina Ivanovna , been with you ? '' 
Smerdyakov still remained silent , looking quietly at Ivan as before . 
Suddenly , with a motion of his hand , he turned his face away . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` What do you mean by ` nothing ' ? '' 
`` Yes , she has . 
It 's no matter to you . 
Let me alone . '' 
`` No , I wo n't let you alone . 
Tell me , when was she here ? '' 
`` Why , I 'd quite forgotten about her , '' said Smerdyakov , with a scornful smile , and turning his face to Ivan again , he stared at him with a look of frenzied hatred , the same look that he had fixed on him at their last interview , a month before . 
`` You seem very ill yourself , your face is sunken ; you do n't look like yourself , '' he said to Ivan . 
`` Never mind my health , tell me what I ask you. , `` But why are your eyes so yellow ? 
The whites are quite yellow . 
Are you so worried ? '' 
He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright . 
`` Listen ; I 've told you I wo n't go away without an answer ! '' 
Ivan cried , intensely irritated . 
`` Why do you keep pestering me ? 
Why do you torment me ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with a look of suffering . 
`` Damn it ! 
I 've nothing to do with you . 
Just answer my question and I 'll go away . '' 
`` I 've no answer to give you , '' said Smerdyakov , looking down again . 
`` You may be sure I 'll make you answer ! '' 
`` Why are you so uneasy ? '' 
Smerdyakov stared at him , not simply with contempt , but almost with repulsion . 
`` Is this because the trial begins to-morrow ? 
Nothing will happen to you ; ca n't you believe that at last ? 
Go home , go to bed and sleep in peace , do n't be afraid of anything . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ... . 
What have I to be afraid of to-morrow ? '' 
Ivan articulated in astonishment , and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul . 
Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes . 
`` You do n't understand ? '' 
he drawled reproachfully . 
`` It 's a strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce ! '' 
Ivan looked at him speechless . 
The startling , incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his valet , was extraordinary in itself . 
He had not taken such a tone even at their last interview . 
`` I tell you , you 've nothing to be afraid of . 
I wo n't say anything about you ; there 's no proof against you . 
I say , how your hands are trembling !
