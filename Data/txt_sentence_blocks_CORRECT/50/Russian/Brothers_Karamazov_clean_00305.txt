Luckily he had them all in his trunk . 
You can keep your own socks and underclothes . '' 
Mitya flew into a passion . 
`` I wo n't have other people 's clothes ! '' 
he shouted menacingly , `` give me my own ! '' 
`` It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Give me my own . 
Damn Kalganov and his clothes , too ! '' 
It was a long time before they could persuade him . 
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down . 
They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled . 
`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before . 
He had an absurd nightmarish feeling , as though he were out of his mind . 
`` Well , what now ? 
Are you going to flog me ? 
That 's all that 's left for you , '' he said , clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor . 
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though he disdained to speak to him . 
`` He looked too closely at my socks , and turned them inside out on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were - the scoundrel ! '' 
`` Well , now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though in reply to Mitya 's question . 
`` Yes , '' said the prosecutor thoughtfully , as though reflecting on something . 
`` We 've done what we could in your interest , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on , `` but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you , we are , at the present moment - '' `` What is the stone in your ring ? '' 
Mitya interrupted suddenly , as though awakening from a reverie . 
He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it !
