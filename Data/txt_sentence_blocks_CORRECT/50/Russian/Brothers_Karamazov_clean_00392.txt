He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation , and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself . 
`` What have I to be afraid of ? 
Let them write down the whole truth , '' Smerdyakov pronounced firmly . 
`` And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate ? '' 
`` No , not to say every word . '' 
`` And did you tell them that you can sham fits , as you boasted then ? '' 
`` No , I did n't tell them that either . '' 
`` Tell me now , why did you send me then to Tchermashnya ? '' 
`` I was afraid you 'd go away to Moscow ; Tchermashnya is nearer , anyway . '' 
`` You are lying ; you suggested my going away yourself ; you told me to get out of the way of trouble . '' 
`` That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you , foreseeing trouble in the house , to spare you . 
Only I wanted to spare myself even more . 
That 's why I told you to get out of harm 's way , that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house , and would remain at home to protect your father . '' 
`` You might have said it more directly , you blockhead ! '' 
Ivan suddenly fired up . 
`` How could I have said it more directly then ? 
It was simply my fear that made me speak , and you might have been angry , too . 
I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money , for he considered it as good as his own ; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this ? 
I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master 's mattress in the envelope , and you see , he 's murdered him . 
How could you guess it either , sir ? '' 
`` But if you say yourself that it could n't be guessed , how could I have guessed and stayed at home ? 
You contradict yourself ! '' 
said Ivan , pondering . 
`` You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow . '' 
`` How could I guess it from that ? '' 
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted , and again he was silent for a minute . 
`` You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya , that I wanted to have you nearer , for Moscow 's a long way off , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch , knowing you are not far off , would not be so bold . 
And if anything had happened , you might have come to protect me , too , for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch 's illness , and that I was afraid of having a fit . 
And when I explained those knocks to you , by means of which one could go in to the deceased , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me , I thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do something , and so would n't go to Tchermashnya even , but would stay . '' 
`` He talks very coherently , '' thought Ivan , `` though he does mumble ; what 's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of ? '' 
`` You are cunning with me , damn you ! '' 
he exclaimed , getting angry . 
`` But I thought at the time that you quite guessed , '' Smerdyakov parried with the simplest air . 
`` If I 'd guessed , I should have stayed , '' cried Ivan . 
`` Why , I thought that it was because you guessed , that you went away in such a hurry , only to get out of trouble , only to run away and save yourself in your fright . '' 
`` You think that everyone is as great a coward as yourself ? '' 
`` Forgive me , I thought you were like me . '' 
`` Of course , I ought to have guessed , '' Ivan said in agitation ; `` and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying , you are lying again , '' he cried , suddenly recollecting . 
`` Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me , ` It 's always worth while speaking to a clever man ' ? 
So you were glad I went away , since you praised me ? '' 
Smerdyakov sighed again and again . 
A trace of colour came into his face . 
`` If I was pleased , '' he articulated rather breathlessly , `` it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya . 
For it was nearer , anyway . 
Only when I said these words to you , it was not by way of praise , but of reproach . 
You did n't understand it . '' 
`` What reproach ? '' 
`` Why , that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father , and would not protect us , for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand . '' 
`` Damn you ! '' 
Ivan swore again .
