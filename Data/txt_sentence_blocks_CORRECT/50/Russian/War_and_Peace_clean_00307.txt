At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to -- you or Mademoiselle Julie Karagina . 
He is very attentive to her . '' 
`` He visits them ? '' 
`` Yes , very often . 
And do you know the new way of courting ? '' 
said Pierre with an amused smile , evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary . 
`` No , '' replied Princess Mary . 
`` To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy . 
He is very melancholy with Mademoiselle Karagina , '' said Pierre . 
`` Really ? '' 
asked Princess Mary , looking into Pierre 's kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow . 
`` It would be a relief , '' thought she , `` if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone . 
I should like to tell everything to Pierre . 
He is kind and generous . 
It would be a relief . 
He would give me advice . '' 
`` Would you marry him ? '' 
`` Oh , my God , Count , there are moments when I would marry anybody ! '' 
she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice . 
`` Ah , how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that ... '' she went on in a trembling voice , `` that you can do nothing for him but grieve him , and to know that you can not alter this . 
Then there is only one thing left -- to go away , but where could I go ? '' 
`` What is wrong ? 
What is it , Princess ? '' 
But without finishing what she was saying , Princess Mary burst into tears . 
`` I do n't know what is the matter with me today . 
Do n't take any notice -- forget what I have said ! '' 
Pierre 's gaiety vanished completely . 
He anxiously questioned the princess , asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him ; but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said , that she did not remember what she had said , and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of -- that Prince Andrew 's marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son . 
`` Have you any news of the Rostovs ? '' 
she asked , to change the subject . 
`` I was told they are coming soon . 
I am also expecting Andrew any day . 
I should like them to meet here . '' 
`` And how does he now regard the matter ? '' 
asked Pierre , referring to the old prince . 
Princess Mary shook her head . 
`` What is to be done ? 
In a few months the year will be up . 
The thing is impossible . 
I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments . 
I wish they would come sooner . 
I hope to be friends with her . 
You have known them a long time , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Tell me honestly the whole truth : what sort of girl is she , and what do you think of her ? 
-- The real truth , because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his father 's will that I should like to know ... '' An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations , and repeated requests to be told the whole truth , expressed ill-will on the princess ' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should disapprove of Andrew 's choice ; but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought . 
`` I do n't know how to answer your question , '' he said , blushing without knowing why . 
`` I really do n't know what sort of girl she is ; I ca n't analyze her at all . 
She is enchanting , but what makes her so I do n't know . 
That is all one can say about her . '' 
Princess Mary sighed , and the expression on her face said : `` Yes , that 's what I expected and feared . ''
