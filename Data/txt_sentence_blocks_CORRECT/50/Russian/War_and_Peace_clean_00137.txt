said Rostov , throwing the letter under the table . 
`` Why have you thrown that away ? '' 
asked Boris . 
`` It is some letter of recommendation ... what the devil do I want it for ! '' 
`` Why ` What the devil ' ? '' 
said Boris , picking it up and reading the address . 
`` This letter would be of great use to you . '' 
`` I want nothing , and I wo n't be anyone 's adjutant . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
inquired Boris . 
`` It 's a lackey 's job ! '' 
`` You are still the same dreamer , I see , '' remarked Boris , shaking his head . 
`` And you 're still the same diplomatist ! 
But that 's not the point ... Come , how are you ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Well , as you see . 
So far everything 's all right , but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because when once a man starts on military service , he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible . '' 
`` Oh , that 's it ! '' 
said Rostov , evidently thinking of something else . 
He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend 's eyes , evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question . 
Old Gabriel brought in the wine . 
`` Should n't we now send for Berg ? '' 
asked Boris . 
`` He would drink with you . 
I ca n't . '' 
`` Well , send for him ... and how do you get on with that German ? '' 
asked Rostov , with a contemptuous smile . 
`` He is a very , very nice , honest , and pleasant fellow , '' answered Boris . 
Again Rostov looked intently into Boris ' eyes and sighed . 
Berg returned , and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated . 
The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia , Poland , and abroad . 
They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander , the Grand Duke , and told stories of his kindness and irascibility . 
Berg , as usual , kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself , but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke 's quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement . 
With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion , shouting : `` Arnauts ! '' 
-LRB- `` Arnauts '' was the Tsarevich 's favorite expression when he was in a rage -RRB- and called for the company commander . 
`` Would you believe it , Count , I was not at all alarmed , because I knew I was right . 
Without boasting , you know , I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord 's Prayer . 
So , Count , there never is any negligence in my company , and so my conscience was at ease . 
I came forward ... '' -LRB- Berg stood up and showed how he presented himself , with his hand to his cap , and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency than his did . -RRB- 
`` Well , he stormed at me , as the saying is , stormed and stormed and stormed ! 
It was not a matter of life but rather of death , as the saying is . 
` Albanians ! ' 
and ` devils ! ' 
and ` To Siberia ! ' '' 
said Berg with a sagacious smile . 
`` I knew I was in the right so I kept silent ; was not that best , Count ? 
... ` Hey , are you dumb ? ' 
he shouted .
