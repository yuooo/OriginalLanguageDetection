`` Now , Alyosha , take a glass , show what you can do ! 
What shall we drink to ? 
The gates of paradise ? 
Take a glass , Grushenka , you drink to the gates of paradise , too . '' 
`` What gates of paradise ? '' 
She took a glass , Alyosha took his , tasted it and put it back . 
`` No , I 'd better not , '' he smiled gently . 
`` And you bragged ! '' 
cried Rakitin . 
`` Well , if so , I wo n't either , '' chimed in Grushenka , `` I really do n't want any . 
You can drink the whole bottle alone , Rakitin . 
If Alyosha has some , I will . '' 
`` What touching sentimentality ! '' 
said Rakitin tauntingly ; `` and she 's sitting on his knee , too ! 
He 's got something to grieve over , but what 's the matter with you ? 
He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat sausage ... '' `` How so ? '' 
`` His elder died to-day , Father Zossima , the saint . '' 
`` So Father Zossima is dead , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` Good God , I did not know ! '' 
She crossed herself devoutly . 
`` Goodness , what have I been doing , sitting on his knee like this at such a moment ! 
She started up as though in dismay , instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa . 
Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in his face . 
`` Rakitin , '' he said suddenly , in a firm and loud voice ; `` do n't taunt me with having rebelled against God . 
I do n't want to feel angry with you , so you must be kinder , too ; I 've lost a treasure such as you have never had , and you can not judge me now . 
You had much better look at her - do you see how she has pity on me ? 
I came here to find a wicked soul - I felt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself , and I 've found a true sister ; I have found a treasure - a loving heart . 
She had pity on me just now ... . 
Agrafena Alexandrovna , I am speaking of you . 
You 've raised my soul from the depths . '' 
Alyosha 's lips were quivering and he caught his breath . 
`` She has saved you , it seems , '' laughed Rakitin spitefully . 
`` And she meant to get you in her clutches , do your realise that ? '' 
`` Stay , Rakitin . '' 
Grushenka jumped up . 
`` Hush , both of you . 
Now I 'll tell you all about it . 
Hush , Alyosha , your words make me ashamed , for I am bad and not good - that 's what I am . 
And you hush , Rakitin , because you are telling lies . 
I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches , but now you are lying , now it 's all different . 
And do n't let me hear anything more from you , Rakitin . '' 
All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion . 
`` They are both crazy , '' said Rakitin , looking at them with amazement . 
`` I feel as though I were in a madhouse . 
They 're both getting so feeble they 'll begin crying in a minute . '' 
`` I shall begin to cry , I shall , '' repeated Grushenka . 
`` He called me his sister and I shall never forget that . 
Only let me tell you , Rakitin , though I am bad , I did give away an onion . '' 
`` An onion ? 
Hang it all , you really are crazy . ''
