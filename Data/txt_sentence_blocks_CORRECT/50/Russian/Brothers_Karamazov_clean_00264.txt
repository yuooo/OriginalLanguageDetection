`` No , I 'm not going to play any more , '' observed Kalganov , `` I 've lost fifty roubles to them just now . '' 
`` The pan had no luck , perhaps he 'll be lucky this time , '' the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction . 
`` How much in the bank ? 
To correspond ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` That 's according , panie , maybe a hundred , maybe two hundred , as much as you will stake . '' 
`` A million ! '' 
laughed Mitya . 
`` The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky , perhaps ? '' 
`` What Podvysotsky ? '' 
`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . ' 
The banker throws the dice . 
Podvysotsky wins . 
` Take it , panie , ' says the banker , and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million . 
` Take it , panie , this is your gain . ' 
There was a million in the bank . ' 
I did n't know that , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` Panie Podvysotsky , ' said the banker , ` you pledged your honour and we pledged ours . ' 
Podvysotsky took the million . '' 
`` That 's not true , '' said Kalganov . 
`` Panie Kalganov , in gentlemanly society one does n't say such things . '' 
`` As if a Polish gambler would give away a million ! '' 
cried Mitya , but checked himself at once . 
`` Forgive me , panie , it 's my fault again ; he would , he would give away a million , for honour , for Polish honour . 
You see how I talk Polish , ha ha ! 
Here , I stake ten roubles , the knave leads . '' 
`` And I put a rouble on the queen , the queen of hearts , the pretty little panienotchka * he ! 
he ! '' 
laughed Maximov , pulling out his queen , and , as though trying to conceal it from everyone , he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table . 
Mitya won . 
The rouble won , too . 
* Little miss . 
`` A corner ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I 'll bet another rouble , a ` single ' stake , '' Maximov muttered gleefully , hugely delighted at having won a rouble . 
`` Lost ! '' 
shouted Mitya . 
`` A ` double ' on the seven ! '' 
The seven too was trumped . 
`` Stop ! '' 
cried Kalganov suddenly . 
`` Double ! 
Double ! '' 
Mitya doubled his stakes , and each time he doubled the stake , the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles . 
The rouble stakes kept winning . 
`` On the double ! ''
