`` The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead , spikes the guns , and the bridge is taken ! 
But what is best of all , '' he went on , his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story , `` is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge , this sergeant , seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge , was about to fire , but Lannes stayed his hand . 
The sergeant , who was evidently wiser than his general , goes up to Auersperg and says : ` Prince , you are being deceived , here are the French ! ' 
Murat , seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak , turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment -LRB- he is a true Gascon -RRB- and says : ' I do n't recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline , if you allow a subordinate to address you like that ! ' 
It was a stroke of genius . 
Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested . 
Come , you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful ! 
It is not exactly stupidity , nor rascality ... '' * Bridgehead . 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy . 
`` It may be treachery , '' said Prince Andrew , vividly imagining the gray overcoats , wounds , the smoke of gunpowder , the sounds of firing , and the glory that awaited him . 
`` Not that either . 
That puts the court in too bad a light , '' replied Bilibin . 
`` It 's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity : it is just as at Ulm ... it is ... '' -- he seemed to be trying to find the right expression . 
`` C'est ... c'est du Mack . 
Nous sommes mackes -LSB- It is ... it is a bit of Mack . 
We are Macked -RSB- , '' he concluded , feeling that he had produced a good epigram , a fresh one that would be repeated . 
His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure , and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails . 
`` Where are you off to ? '' 
he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room . 
`` I am going away . '' 
`` Where to ? '' 
`` To the army . '' 
`` But you meant to stay another two days ? '' 
`` But now I am off at once . '' 
And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room . 
`` Do you know , mon cher , '' said Bilibin following him , `` I have been thinking about you . 
Why are you going ? '' 
And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face . 
Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply . 
`` Why are you going ? 
I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger . 
I understand that . 
Mon cher , it is heroism ! '' 
`` Not at all , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` But as you are a philosopher , be a consistent one , look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty , on the contrary , is to take care of yourself . 
Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else ... . 
You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here ; therefore , you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us . 
They say we are going to Olmutz , and Olmutz is a very decent town . 
You and I will travel comfortably in my caleche . '' 
`` Do stop joking , Bilibin , '' cried Bolkonski . 
`` I am speaking sincerely as a friend ! 
Consider ! 
Where and why are you going , when you might remain here ? 
You are faced by one of two things , '' and the skin over his left temple puckered , `` either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded , or you will share defeat and disgrace with Kutuzov 's whole army . '' 
And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple , feeling that the dilemma was insoluble . 
`` I can not argue about it , '' replied Prince Andrew coldly , but he thought : `` I am going to save the army . '' 
`` My dear fellow , you are a hero ! '' 
said Bilibin . 
That same night , having taken leave of the Minister of War , Bolkonski set off to rejoin the army , not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems . 
In Brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up , and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olmutz .
