`` You have only lately arrived ? '' 
the countess asked him . 
`` Oui , madame , '' replied he , looking around him . 
`` You have not yet seen my husband ? '' 
`` Non , madame . '' 
He smiled quite inappropriately . 
`` You have been in Paris recently , I believe ? 
I suppose it 's very interesting . '' 
`` Very interesting . '' 
The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna . 
The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man , and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father ; but he answered her , as he had the countess , only in monosyllables . 
The other guests were all conversing with one another . 
`` The Razumovskis ... It was charming ... You are very kind ... Countess Apraksina ... '' was heard on all sides . 
The countess rose and went into the ballroom . 
`` Marya Dmitrievna ? '' 
came her voice from there . 
`` Herself , '' came the answer in a rough voice , and Marya Dmitrievna entered the room . 
All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose . 
Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door . 
Tall and stout , holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls , she stood surveying the guests , and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up . 
Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian . 
`` Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children , '' she said , in her loud , full-toned voice which drowned all others . 
`` Well , you old sinner , '' she went on , turning to the count who was kissing her hand , `` you 're feeling dull in Moscow , I daresay ? 
Nowhere to hunt with your dogs ? 
But what is to be done , old man ? 
Just see how these nestlings are growing up , '' and she pointed to the girls . 
`` You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not ... '' `` Well , '' said she , `` how 's my Cossack ? '' 
-LRB- Marya Dmitrievna always called Natasha a Cossack -RRB- and she stroked the child 's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand . 
`` I know she 's a scamp of a girl , but I like her . '' 
She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and , having given them to the rosy Natasha , who beamed with the pleasure of her saint 's - day fete , turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre . 
`` Eh , eh , friend ! 
Come here a bit , '' said she , assuming a soft high tone of voice . 
`` Come here , my friend ... '' and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher . 
Pierre approached , looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles . 
`` Come nearer , come nearer , friend ! 
I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor , and in your case it 's my evident duty . '' 
She paused . 
All were silent , expectant of what was to follow , for this was dearly only a prelude . 
`` A fine lad ! 
My word ! 
A fine lad ! 
... His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear ! 
For shame , sir , for shame ! 
It would be better if you went to the war . '' 
She turned away and gave her hand to the count , who could hardly keep from laughing . 
`` Well , I suppose it is time we were at table ? '' 
said Marya Dmitrievna . 
The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna , the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars , a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment ; then came Anna Mikhaylovna with Shinshin . 
Berg gave his arm to Vera . 
The smiling Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas .
