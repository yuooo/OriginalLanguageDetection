Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair , bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face . 
Jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches , diffusing an odor of perfume , and admiring his partner , himself , and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots , Nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in Voronezh . 
`` Which lady ? '' 
`` A charming lady , a divine one . 
Her eyes '' -LRB- Nicholas looked at his partner -RRB- `` are blue , her mouth coral and ivory ; her figure '' -LRB- he glanced at her shoulders -RRB- `` like Diana 's ... '' The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about . 
`` Ah , Nikita Ivanych ! '' 
cried Nicholas , rising politely , and as if wishing Nikita Ivanych to share his joke , he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady . 
The husband smiled gloomily , the wife gaily . 
The governor 's good-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval . 
`` Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you , Nicholas , '' said she , pronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignatyevna was a very important person . 
`` Come , Nicholas ! 
You know you let me call you so ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , Aunt . 
Who is she ? '' 
`` Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva . 
She has heard from her niece how you rescued her ... Can you guess ? '' 
`` I rescued such a lot of them ! '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` Her niece , Princess Bolkonskaya . 
She is here in Voronezh with her aunt . 
Oho ! 
How you blush . 
Why , are ... ? '' 
`` Not a bit ! 
Please do n't , Aunt ! '' 
`` Very well , very well ! 
... Oh , what a fellow you are ! '' 
The governor 's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress , who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town . 
This was Malvintseva , Princess Mary 's aunt on her mother 's side , a rich , childless widow who always lived in Voronezh . 
When Rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game . 
She looked at him and , screwing up her eyes sternly , continued to upbraid the general who had won from her . 
`` Very pleased , mon cher , '' she then said , holding out her hand to Nicholas . 
`` Pray come and see me . '' 
After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father , whom Malvintseva had evidently not liked , and having asked what Nicholas knew of Prince Andrew , who also was evidently no favorite of hers , the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her . 
Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed . 
At the mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear , which he himself did not understand . 
When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing , but the governor 's little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and , saying that she wanted to have a talk with him , led him to her sitting room , from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way . 
`` Do you know , dear boy , '' began the governor 's wife with a serious expression on her kind little face , `` that really would be the match for you : would you like me to arrange it ? '' 
`` Whom do you mean , Aunt ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` I will make a match for you with the princess . 
Catherine Petrovna speaks of Lily , but I say , no -- the princess ! 
Do you want me to do it ? 
I am sure your mother will be grateful to me . 
What a charming girl she is , really ! 
And she is not at all so plain , either . '' 
`` Not at all , '' replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea . 
`` As befits a soldier , Aunt , I do n't force myself on anyone or refuse anything , '' he said before he had time to consider what he was saying . 
`` Well then , remember , this is not a joke ! '' 
`` Of course not ! ''
