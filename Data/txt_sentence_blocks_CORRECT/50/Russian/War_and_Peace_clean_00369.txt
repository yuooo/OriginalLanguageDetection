`` I think ... '' Pierre replied , `` that he has nothing to forgive ... . 
If I were in his place ... '' By association of ideas , Pierre was at once carried back to the day when , trying to comfort her , he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free , he would ask on his knees for her hand ; and the same feeling of pity , tenderness , and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips . 
But she did not give him time to say them . 
`` Yes , you ... you ... '' she said , uttering the word you rapturously - `` that 's a different thing . 
I know no one kinder , more generous , or better than you ; nobody could be ! 
Had you not been there then , and now too , I do n't know what would have become of me , because ... '' Tears suddenly rose in her eyes , she turned away , lifted her music before her eyes , began singing again , and again began walking up and down the room . 
Just then Petya came running in from the drawing room . 
Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled Natasha . 
He was preparing to enter the university , but he and his friend Obolenski had lately , in secret , agreed to join the hussars . 
Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair . 
He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars . 
Pierre walked up and down the drawing room , not listening to what Petya was saying . 
Petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention . 
`` Well , what about my plan ? 
Peter Kirilych , for heaven 's sake ! 
You are my only hope , '' said Petya . 
`` Oh yes , your plan . 
To join the hussars ? 
I 'll mention it , I 'll bring it all up today . '' 
`` Well , mon cher , have you got the manifesto ? '' 
asked the old count . 
`` The countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis ' and heard the new prayer . 
She says it 's very fine . '' 
`` Yes , I 've got it , '' said Pierre . 
`` The Emperor is to be here tomorrow ... there 's to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility , and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand . 
Oh yes , let me congratulate you ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , thank God ! 
Well , and what news from the army ? '' 
`` We are again retreating . 
They say we 're already near Smolensk , '' replied Pierre . 
`` O Lord , O Lord ! '' 
exclaimed the count . 
`` Where is the manifesto ? '' 
`` The Emperor 's appeal ? 
Oh yes ! '' 
Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers , but could not find them . 
Still slapping his pockets , he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around , evidently expecting Natasha , who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room . 
`` On my word , I do n't know what I 've done with it , '' he said . 
`` There he is , always losing everything ! '' 
remarked the countess . 
Natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at Pierre . 
As soon as she entered , Pierre 's features , which had been gloomy , suddenly lighted up , and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times . 
`` No , really ! 
I 'll drive home , I must have left them there . 
I 'll certainly ... '' `` But you 'll be late for dinner . '' 
`` Oh ! 
And my coachman has gone . '' 
But Sonya , who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom , had found them in Pierre 's hat , where he had carefully tucked them under the lining . 
Pierre was about to begin reading . 
`` No , after dinner , '' said the old count , evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading .
