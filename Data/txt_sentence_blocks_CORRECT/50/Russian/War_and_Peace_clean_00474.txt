said Natasha , putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall , stout man in a coachman 's long coat , who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise , and who was passing under the arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small , sallow-faced , beardless old man in a frieze coat . 
`` Yes , it really is Bezukhov in a coachman 's coat , with a queer-looking old boy . 
Really , '' said Natasha , `` look , look ! '' 
`` No , it 's not he . 
How can you talk such nonsense ? '' 
`` Mamma , '' screamed Natasha , `` I 'll stake my head it 's he ! 
I assure you ! 
Stop , stop ! '' 
she cried to the coachman . 
But the coachman could not stop , for from the Meshchanski Street came more carts and carriages , and the Rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way . 
In fact , however , though now much farther off than before , the Rostovs all saw Pierre -- or someone extraordinarily like him -- in a coachman 's coat , going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small , beardless old man who looked like a footman . 
That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them , and respectfully touching Pierre 's elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage . 
Pierre , evidently engrossed in thought , could not at first understand him . 
At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated , he recognized Natasha , and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach . 
But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped . 
Natasha 's face , leaning out of the window , beamed with quizzical kindliness . 
`` Peter Kirilovich , come here ! 
We have recognized you ! 
This is wonderful ! '' 
she cried , holding out her hand to him . 
`` What are you doing ? 
Why are you like this ? '' 
Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on . 
`` What is the matter , Count ? '' 
asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone . 
`` What ? 
What ? 
Why ? 
Do n't ask me , '' said Pierre , and looked round at Natasha whose radiant , happy expression -- of which he was conscious without looking at her -- filled him with enchantment . 
`` Are you remaining in Moscow , then ? '' 
Pierre hesitated . 
`` In Moscow ? '' 
he said in a questioning tone . 
`` Yes , in Moscow . 
Goodby ! '' 
`` Ah , if only I were a man ? 
I 'd certainly stay with you . 
How splendid ! '' 
said Natasha . 
`` Mamma , if you 'll let me , I 'll stay ! '' 
Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something , but the countess interrupted him . 
`` You were at the battle , we heard . '' 
`` Yes , I was , '' Pierre answered . 
`` There will be another battle tomorrow ... '' he began , but Natasha interrupted him . 
`` But what is the matter with you , Count ? 
You are not like yourself ... '' `` Oh , do n't ask me , do n't ask me ! 
I do n't know myself . 
Tomorrow ... But no ! 
Good-by , good-by ! '' 
he muttered .
