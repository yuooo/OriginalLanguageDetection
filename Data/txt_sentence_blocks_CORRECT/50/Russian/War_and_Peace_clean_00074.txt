`` There was no one else in the room except myself . 
So that if it is not so , then ... '' He could not finish , and ran out of the room . 
`` Ah , may the devil take you and evewybody , '' were the last words Rostov heard . 
Rostov went to Telyanin 's quarters . 
`` The master is not in , he 's gone to headquarters , '' said Telyanin 's orderly . 
`` Has something happened ? '' 
he added , surprised at the cadet 's troubled face . 
`` No , nothing . '' 
`` You 've only just missed him , '' said the orderly . 
The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck , and Rostov , without returning home , took a horse and rode there . 
There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented . 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin 's horse at the porch . 
In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine . 
`` Ah , you 've come here too , young man ! '' 
he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows . 
`` Yes , '' said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word ; and he sat down at the nearest table . 
Both were silent . 
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room . 
No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant . 
When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and , drawing its rings aside with his small , white , turned-up fingers , drew out a gold imperial , and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter . 
`` Please be quick , '' he said . 
The coin was a new one . 
Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin . 
`` Allow me to look at your purse , '' he said in a low , almost inaudible , voice . 
With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised , Telyanin handed him the purse . 
`` Yes , it 's a nice purse . 
Yes , yes , '' he said , growing suddenly pale , and added , `` Look at it , young man . '' 
Rostov took the purse in his hand , examined it and the money in it , and looked at Telyanin . 
The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry . 
`` If we get to Vienna I 'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there 's nowhere to spend it , '' said he . 
`` Well , let me have it , young man , I 'm going . '' 
Rostov did not speak . 
`` And you ? 
Are you going to have lunch too ? 
They feed you quite decently here , '' continued Telyanin . 
`` Now then , let me have it . '' 
He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse . 
Rostov let go of it . 
Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches , with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open , as if to say , `` Yes , yes , I am putting my purse in my pocket and that 's quite simple and is no else 's business . '' 
`` Well , young man ? '' 
he said with a sigh , and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostov 's eyes . 
Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin 's eyes to Rostov 's and back , and back again and again in an instant . 
`` Come here , '' said Rostov , catching hold of Telyanin 's arm and almost dragging him to the window . 
`` That money is Denisov 's ; you took it ... '' he whispered just above Telyanin 's ear . 
`` What ? 
What ? 
How dare you ? 
What ? '' 
said Telyanin . 
But these words came like a piteous , despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon .
