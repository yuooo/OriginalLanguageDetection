It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying , but could not . 
The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms , dreams , and hopes of happiness or goodness , in Prince Andrew 's presence . 
He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views , which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour . 
He checked himself , fearing to seem naive , yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different , and better , Pierre than he had been in Petersburg . 
`` I ca n't tell you how much I have lived through since then . 
I hardly know myself again . '' 
`` Yes , we have altered much , very much , since then , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you ? 
What are your plans ? '' 
`` Plans ! '' 
repeated Prince Andrew ironically . 
`` My plans ? '' 
he said , as if astonished at the word . 
`` Well , you see , I 'm building . 
I mean to settle here altogether next year ... '' Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew 's face , which had grown much older . 
`` No , I meant to ask ... '' Pierre began , but Prince Andrew interrupted him . 
`` But why talk of me ? 
... Talk to me , yes , tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates . '' 
Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates , trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made . 
Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre 's story of what he had been doing , as though it were all an old-time story , and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him . 
Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend 's company and at last became silent . 
`` I 'll tell you what , my dear fellow , '' said Prince Andrew , who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor , `` I am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round . 
I am going back to my sister today . 
I will introduce you to her . 
But of course you know her already , '' he said , evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common . 
`` We will go after dinner . 
And would you now like to look round my place ? '' 
They went out and walked about till dinnertime , talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately . 
Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings , but even here , while on the scaffolding , in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house , he interrupted himself : `` However , this is not at all interesting . 
Let us have dinner , and then we 'll set off . '' 
At dinner , conversation turned on Pierre 's marriage . 
`` I was very much surprised when I heard of it , '' said Prince Andrew . 
Pierre blushed , as he always did when it was mentioned , and said hurriedly : `` I will tell you some time how it all happened . 
But you know it is all over , and forever . '' 
`` Forever ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` Nothing 's forever . '' 
`` But you know how it all ended , do n't you ? 
You heard of the duel ? '' 
`` And so you had to go through that too ! '' 
`` One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man , '' said Pierre . 
`` Why so ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` To kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really . '' 
`` No , to kill a man is bad -- wrong . '' 
`` Why is it wrong ? '' 
urged Prince Andrew . 
`` It is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong . 
Men always did and always will err , and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong . '' 
`` What does harm to another is wrong , '' said Pierre , feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused , had begun to talk , and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state .
