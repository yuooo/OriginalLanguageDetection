`` Who was that ? 
The Military Governor himself ? '' 
was being asked at the other side of the room . 
`` How young-looking he is ! '' 
`` Yes , and he is over sixty . 
I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone . 
They wished to administer the sacrament of unction . '' 
`` I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times . '' 
The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain , who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine , leaning his elbow on a table . 
`` Beautiful , '' said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather . 
`` The weather is beautiful , Princess ; and besides , in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country . '' 
`` Yes , indeed , '' replied the princess with a sigh . 
`` So he may have something to drink ? '' 
Lorrain considered . 
`` Has he taken his medicine ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
The doctor glanced at his watch . 
`` Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar , '' and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch . 
`` Dere has neffer been a gase , '' a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp , `` dat one liffs after de sird stroke . '' 
`` And what a well-preserved man he was ! '' 
remarked the aide-de-camp . 
`` And who will inherit his wealth ? '' 
he added in a whisper . 
`` It vo n't go begging , '' replied the German with a smile . 
Everyone again looked toward the door , which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain 's instructions . 
The German doctor went up to Lorrain . 
`` Do you think he can last till morning ? '' 
asked the German , addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly . 
Lorrain , pursing up his lips , waved a severely negative finger before his nose . 
`` Tonight , not later , '' said he in a low voice , and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient 's condition . 
Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess ' room . 
In this room it was almost dark ; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles . 
The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture , whatnots , cupboards , and little tables . 
The quilt of a high , white feather bed was just visible behind a screen . 
A small dog began to bark . 
`` Ah , is it you , cousin ? '' 
She rose and smoothed her hair , which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish . 
`` Has anything happened ? '' 
she asked . 
`` I am so terrified . '' 
`` No , there is no change . 
I only came to have a talk about business , Catiche , '' * muttered the prince , seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated . 
`` You have made the place warm , I must say , '' he remarked . 
`` Well , sit down : let 's have a talk . '' 
* Catherine . 
`` I thought perhaps something had happened , '' she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression ; and , sitting down opposite the prince , she prepared to listen . 
`` I wished to get a nap , mon cousin , but I ca n't . '' 
`` Well , my dear ? '' 
said Prince Vasili , taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit . 
It was plain that this `` well ? ''
