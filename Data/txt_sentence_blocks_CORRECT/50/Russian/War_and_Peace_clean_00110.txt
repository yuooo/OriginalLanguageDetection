Among the limbers lay several dead men . 
One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine . 
But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again . 
`` I can not be afraid , '' thought he , and dismounted slowly among the guns . 
He delivered the order and did not leave the battery . 
He decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence . 
Together with Tushin , stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French , he attended to the removal of the guns . 
`` A staff officer was here a minute ago , but skipped off , '' said an artilleryman to Prince Andrew . 
`` Not like your honor ! '' 
Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin . 
They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another . 
When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four , they began moving down the hill -LRB- one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind -RRB- , Prince Andrew rode up to Tushin . 
`` Well , till we meet again ... '' he said , holding out his hand to Tushin . 
`` Good-by , my dear fellow , '' said Tushin . 
`` Dear soul ! 
Good-by , my dear fellow ! '' 
and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes . 
The wind had fallen and black clouds , merging with the powder smoke , hung low over the field of battle on the horizon . 
It was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous . 
The cannonade was dying down , but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer . 
As soon as Tushin with his guns , continually driving round or coming upon wounded men , was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip , he was met by some of the staff , among them the staff officer and Zherkov , who had been twice sent to Tushin 's battery but had never reached it . 
Interrupting one another , they all gave , and transmitted , orders as to how to proceed , reprimanding and reproaching him . 
Tushin gave no orders , and , silently -- fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why -- rode behind on his artillery nag . 
Though the orders were to abandon the wounded , many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages . 
The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin 's wattle shed was laid , with a bullet in his stomach , on `` Matvevna 's '' carriage . 
At the foot of the hill , a pale hussar cadet , supporting one hand with the other , came up to Tushin and asked for a seat . 
`` Captain , for God 's sake ! 
I 've hurt my arm , '' he said timidly . 
`` For God 's sake ... I ca n't walk . 
For God 's sake ! '' 
It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused . 
He asked in a hesitating , piteous voice . 
`` Tell them to give me a seat , for God 's sake ! '' 
`` Give him a seat , '' said Tushin . 
`` Lay a cloak for him to sit on , lad , '' he said , addressing his favorite soldier . 
`` And where is the wounded officer ? '' 
`` He has been set down . 
He died , '' replied someone . 
`` Help him up . 
Sit down , dear fellow , sit down ! 
Spread out the cloak , Antonov . '' 
The cadet was Rostov . 
With one hand he supported the other ; he was pale and his jaw trembled , shivering feverishly . 
He was placed on `` Matvevna , '' the gun from which they had removed the dead officer . 
The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm . 
`` What , are you wounded , my lad ? '' 
said Tushin , approaching the gun on which Rostov sat . 
`` No , it 's a sprain . '' 
`` Then what is this blood on the gun carriage ? '' 
inquired Tushin .
