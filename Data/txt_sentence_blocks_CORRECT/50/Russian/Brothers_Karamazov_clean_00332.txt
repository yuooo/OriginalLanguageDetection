`` Tchizhov . '' 
`` The devil take Tchizhov and you with him . 
I 'll give him a hiding , that I will . 
He was laughing at me ! '' 
`` Will give Tchizhov a hiding ! 
More likely he will give you one . 
You are a fool , that 's what you are ! '' 
`` Not Tchizhov , not Tchizhov , you spiteful , mischievous woman . 
I 'll give the boy a hiding . 
Catch him , catch him , he was laughing at me The woman guffawed . 
But Kolya was by now a long way off , marching along with a triumphant air . 
Smurov walked beside him , looking round at the shouting group far behind . 
He too was in high spirits , though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya 's company . 
`` What Sabaneyev did you mean ? '' 
he asked Kolya , foreseeing what his answer would be . 
`` How do I know ? 
Now there 'll be a hubbub among them all day . 
I like to stir up fools in every class of society . 
There 's another blockhead , that peasant there . 
You know , they say ` there 's no one stupider than a stupid Frenchman , ' but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much . 
Ca n't you see it all over his face that he is a fool , that peasant , eh ? '' 
`` Let him alone , Kolya . 
Let 's go on . '' 
`` Nothing could stop me , now I am once off . 
Hey , good morning , peasant ! '' 
A sturdy-looking peasant , with a round , simple face and grizzled beard , who was walking by , raised his head and looked at the boy . 
He seemed not quite sober . 
`` Good morning , if you are not laughing at me , '' he said deliberately in reply . 
`` And if I am ? '' 
laughed Kolya . 
`` Well , a joke 's a joke . 
Laugh away . 
I do n't mind . 
There 's no harm in a joke . '' 
`` I beg your pardon , brother , it was a joke . '' 
`` Well , God forgive you ! '' 
`` Do you forgive me , too ? '' 
`` I quite forgive you . 
Go along . '' 
`` I say , you seem a clever peasant . '' 
`` Cleverer than you , '' the peasant answered unexpectedly , with the same gravity . 
`` I doubt it , '' said Kolya , somewhat taken aback . 
`` It 's true , though . '' 
`` Perhaps it is . '' 
`` It is , brother . '' 
`` Good-bye , peasant ! '' 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` There are all sorts of peasants , '' Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence . 
`` How could I tell I had hit on a clever one ? 
I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry . ''
