`` They say the ball will be very good , '' replied the princess , drawing up her downy little lip . 
`` All the pretty women in society will be there . '' 
`` Not all , for you will not be there ; not all , '' said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully ; and snatching the shawl from the footman , whom he even pushed aside , he began wrapping it round the princess . 
Either from awkwardness or intentionally -LRB- no one could have said which -RRB- after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time , as though embracing her . 
Still smiling , she gracefully moved away , turning and glancing at her husband . 
Prince Andrew 's eyes were closed , so weary and sleepy did he seem . 
`` Are you ready ? '' 
he asked his wife , looking past her . 
Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak , which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels , and , stumbling in it , ran out into the porch following the princess , whom a footman was helping into the carriage . 
`` Princesse , au revoir , '' cried he , stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet . 
The princess , picking up her dress , was taking her seat in the dark carriage , her husband was adjusting his saber ; Prince Hippolyte , under pretense of helping , was in everyone 's way . 
`` Allow me , sir , '' said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold , disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path . 
`` I am expecting you , Pierre , '' said the same voice , but gently and affectionately . 
The postilion started , the carriage wheels rattled . 
Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home . 
`` Well , mon cher , '' said the vicomte , having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage , `` your little princess is very nice , very nice indeed , quite French , '' and he kissed the tips of his fingers . 
Hippolyte burst out laughing . 
`` Do you know , you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs , '' continued the vicomte . 
`` I pity the poor husband , that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch . '' 
Hippolyte spluttered again , and amid his laughter said , `` And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French ? 
One has to know how to deal with them . '' 
Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew 's study like one quite at home , and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa , took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand -LRB- it was Caesar 's Commentaries -RRB- , and resting on his elbow , began reading it in the middle . 
`` What have you done to Mlle Scherer ? 
She will be quite ill now , '' said Prince Andrew , as he entered the study , rubbing his small white hands . 
Pierre turned his whole body , making the sofa creak . 
He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew , smiled , and waved his hand . 
`` That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light ... . 
In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but -- I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power ... '' It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation . 
`` One ca n't everywhere say all one thinks , mon cher . 
Well , have you at last decided on anything ? 
Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence . 
Pierre sat up on the sofa , with his legs tucked under him . 
`` Really , I do n't yet know . 
I do n't like either the one or the other . '' 
`` But you must decide on something ! 
Your father expects it . '' 
Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor , and had remained away till he was twenty . 
When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man , `` Now go to Petersburg , look round , and choose your profession . 
I will agree to anything . 
Here is a letter to Prince Vasili , and here is money . 
Write to me all about it , and I will help you in everything . '' 
Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months , and had not decided on anything . 
It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking . 
Pierre rubbed his forehead . 
`` But he must be a Freemason , '' said he , referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening . 
`` That is all nonsense . '' 
Prince Andrew again interrupted him , `` let us talk business . 
Have you been to the Horse Guards ? '' 
`` No , I have not ; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you .
