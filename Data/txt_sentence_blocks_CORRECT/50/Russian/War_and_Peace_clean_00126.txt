Life without Princess Mary , little as he seemed to value her , was unthinkable to him . 
`` And why should she marry ? '' 
he thought . 
`` To be unhappy for certain . 
There 's Lise , married to Andrew -- a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays -- but is she contented with her lot ? 
And who would marry Marie for love ? 
Plain and awkward ! 
They 'll take her for her connections and wealth . 
Are there no women living unmarried , and even the happier for it ? '' 
So thought Prince Bolkonski while dressing , and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer . 
Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing , and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer . 
His birth and position in society were not bad . 
`` Well , I 've nothing against it , '' the prince said to himself , `` but he must be worthy of her . 
And that is what we shall see . '' 
`` That is what we shall see ! 
That is what we shall see ! '' 
he added aloud . 
He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step , glancing rapidly round the company . 
He noticed the change in the little princess ' dress , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's ribbon , Princess Mary 's unbecoming coiffure , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's and Anatole 's smiles , and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation . 
`` Got herself up like a fool ! '' 
he thought , looking irritably at her . 
`` She is shameless , and he ignores her ! '' 
He went straight up to Prince Vasili . 
`` Well ! 
How d'ye do ? 
How d'ye do ? 
Glad to see you ! '' 
`` Friendship laughs at distance , '' began Prince Vasili in his usual rapid , self-confident , familiar tone . 
`` Here is my second son ; please love and befriend him . '' 
Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole . 
`` Fine young fellow ! 
Fine young fellow ! '' 
he said . 
`` Well , come and kiss me , '' and he offered his cheek . 
Anatole kissed the old man , and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure , waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect . 
Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and , drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasili , pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news . 
He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasili said , but kept glancing at Princess Mary . 
`` And so they are writing from Potsdam already ? '' 
he said , repeating Prince Vasili 's last words . 
Then rising , he suddenly went up to his daughter . 
`` Is it for visitors you 've got yourself up like that , eh ? '' 
said he . 
`` Fine , very fine ! 
You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors , and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent . '' 
`` It was my fault , mon pere , '' interceded the little princess , with a blush . 
`` You must do as you please , '' said Prince Bolkonski , bowing to his daughter-in-law , `` but she need not make a fool of herself , she 's plain enough as it is . '' 
And he sat down again , paying no more attention to his daughter , who was reduced to tears . 
`` On the contrary , that coiffure suits the princess very well , '' said Prince Vasili . 
`` Now you , young prince , what 's your name ? '' 
said Prince Bolkonski , turning to Anatole , `` come here , let us talk and get acquainted . ''
