Chemist or what ? '' 
`` He must be a savant , '' answered Alyosha ; `` but I confess I ca n't tell you much about him , either . 
I 've heard of him as a savant , but what sort I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , damn him , then ! 
I do n't know either , '' swore Mitya . 
`` A scoundrel of some sort , most likely . 
They are all scoundrels . 
And Rakitin will make his way . 
Rakitin will get on anywhere ; he is another Bernard . 
Ugh , these Bernards ! 
They are all over the place . '' 
`` But what is the matter ? '' 
Alyosha asked insistently . 
`` He wants to write an article about me , about my case , and so begin his literary career . 
That 's what he comes for ; he said so himself . 
He wants to prove some theory . 
He wants to say ` he could n't help murdering his father , he was corrupted by his environment , ' and so on . 
He explained it all to me . 
He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism , he says . 
But there , damn the fellow , he can put in a tinge if he likes , I do n't care . 
He ca n't bear Ivan , he hates him . 
He 's not fond of you , either . 
But I do n't turn him out , for he is a clever fellow . 
Awfully conceited , though . 
I said to him just now , ' The Karamazovs are not blackguards , but philosophers ; for all true Russians are philosophers , and though you 've studied , you are not a philosopher - you are a low fellow . ' 
He laughed , so maliciously . 
And I said to him , ` De ideabus non est disputandum . ' 
* Is n't that rather good ? 
I can set up for being a classic , you see ! '' 
Mitya laughed suddenly . 
* There 's no disputing ideas . 
`` Why is it all over with you ? 
You said so just now , '' Alyosha interposed . 
`` Why is it all over with me ? 
H 'm ! 
... The fact of it is ... if you take it as a whole , I am sorry to lose God - that 's why it is . '' 
`` What do you mean by ` sorry to lose God ' ? '' 
`` Imagine : inside , in the nerves , in the head - that is , these nerves are there in the brain ... -LRB- damn them ! -RRB- 
there are sort of little tails , the little tails of those nerves , and as soon as they begin quivering ... that is , you see , I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering , those little tails ... and when they quiver , then an image appears ... it does n't appear at once , but an instant , a second , passes ... and then something like a moment appears ; that is , not a moment - devil take the moment ! 
- but an image ; that is , an object , or an action , damn it ! 
That 's why I see and then think , because of those tails , not at all because I 've got a soul , and that I am some sort of image and likeness . 
All that is nonsense ! 
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday , brother , and it simply bowled me over . 
It 's magnificent , Alyosha , this science ! 
A new man 's arising - that I understand ... . 
And yet I am sorry to lose God ! '' 
`` Well , that 's a good thing , anyway , '' said Alyosha . 
`` That I am sorry to lose God ? 
It 's chemistry , brother , chemistry ! 
There 's no help for it , your reverence , you must make way for chemistry .
