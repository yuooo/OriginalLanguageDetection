Among these folk , too , there are good men as well as bad , '' said he , and still speaking , he turned on his knees with a supple movement , got up , coughed , and went off to another part of the shed . 
`` Eh , you rascal ! '' 
Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed . 
`` So you 've come , you rascal ? 
She remembers ... Now , now , that 'll do ! '' 
And the soldier , pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him , returned to his place and sat down . 
In his hands he had something wrapped in a rag . 
`` Here , eat a bit , sir , '' said he , resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes . 
`` We had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand ! '' 
Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him . 
He thanked the soldier and began to eat . 
`` Well , are they all right ? '' 
said the soldier with a smile . 
`` You should do like this . '' 
He took a potato , drew out his clasp knife , cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand , sprinkled some salt on it from the rag , and handed it to Pierre . 
`` The potatoes are grand ! '' 
he said once more . 
`` Eat some like that ! '' 
Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better . 
`` Oh , I 'm all right , '' said he , `` but why did they shoot those poor fellows ? 
The last one was hardly twenty . '' 
`` Tss , tt ... ! '' 
said the little man . 
`` Ah , what a sin ... what a sin ! '' 
he added quickly , and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on : `` How was it , sir , that you stayed in Moscow ? '' 
`` I did n't think they would come so soon . 
I stayed accidentally , '' replied Pierre . 
`` And how did they arrest you , dear lad ? 
At your house ? '' 
`` No , I went to look at the fire , and they arrested me there , and tried me as an incendiary . '' 
`` Where there 's law there 's injustice , '' put in the little man . 
`` And have you been here long ? '' 
Pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato . 
`` I ? 
It was last Sunday they took me , out of a hospital in Moscow . '' 
`` Why , are you a soldier then ? '' 
`` Yes , we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment . 
I was dying of fever . 
We were n't told anything . 
There were some twenty of us lying there . 
We had no idea , never guessed at all . '' 
`` And do you feel sad here ? '' 
Pierre inquired . 
`` How can one help it , lad ? 
My name is Platon , and the surname is Karataev , '' he added , evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to address him . 
`` They call me ` little falcon ' in the regiment . 
How is one to help feeling sad ? 
Moscow -- she 's the mother of cities . 
How can one see all this and not feel sad ? 
But ` the maggot gnaws the cabbage , yet dies first ' ; that 's what the old folks used to tell us , '' he added rapidly .
