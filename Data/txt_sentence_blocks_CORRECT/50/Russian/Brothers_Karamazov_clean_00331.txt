Kolya scanned him gravely . 
`` Have you been to the Church of the Ascension ? '' 
he suddenly asked him , with stern emphasis . 
`` What Church of Ascension ? 
What for ? 
No , I have n't , '' said the young man , somewhat taken aback . 
`` Do you know Sabaneyev ? '' 
Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely . 
`` What Sabaneyev ? 
No , I do n't know him . '' 
`` Well then you can go to the devil , '' said Kolya , cutting short the conversation ; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev . 
`` Stop , heigh ! 
What Sabaneyev ? '' 
the young man recovered from his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before . 
`` What did he say ? '' 
He turned to the market women with a silly stare . 
The women laughed . 
`` You can never tell what he 's after , '' said one of them . 
`` What Sabaneyev is it he 's talking about ? '' 
the young man repeated , still furious and brandishing his right arm . 
`` It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs , that 's who it must be , '' one of the women suggested . 
The young man stared at her wildly . 
`` For the Kuzmitchovs ? '' 
repeated another woman . 
`` But his name was n't Trifon . 
His name 's Kuzma , not Trifon ; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch , so it ca n't be the same . '' 
`` His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev , it 's Tchizhov , '' put in suddenly a third woman , who had hitherto been silent , listening gravely . 
`` Alexey Ivanitch is his name . 
Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch . '' 
`` Not a doubt about it , it 's Tchizhov , '' a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement . 
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another . 
`` But what did he ask for , what did he ask for , good people ? '' 
he cried almost in desperation . '' 
` Do you know Sabaneyev ? ' 
says he . 
And who the devil 's to know who is Sabaneyev ? '' 
`` You 're a senseless fellow . 
I tell you it 's not Sabaneyev , but Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov , that 's who it is ! '' 
one of the women shouted at him impressively . 
`` What Tchizhov ? 
Who is he ? 
Tell me , if you know . '' 
`` That tall , snivelling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer . '' 
`` And what 's your Tchizhov to do with me , good people , eh ? '' 
`` How can I tell what he 's to do with you ? '' 
put in another . 
`` You ought to know yourself what you want with him , if you make such a clamour about him . 
He spoke to you , he did not speak to us , you stupid . 
Do n't you really know him ? '' 
`` Know whom ? ''
