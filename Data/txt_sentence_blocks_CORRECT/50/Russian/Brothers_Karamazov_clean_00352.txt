`` Oh , well , I am a little , goodness knows why , I do n't know ... '' he muttered , almost embarrassed . 
`` Oh , how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed ! 
Because you are just like me , '' cried Kolya , in positive ecstasy . 
His cheeks glowed , his eyes beamed . 
`` You know , Kolya , you will be very unhappy in your life , '' something made Alyosha say suddenly . 
`` I know , I know . 
How you know it all before hand ! '' 
Kolya agreed at once . 
`` But you will bless life on the whole , all the same . '' 
`` Just so , hurrah ! 
You are a prophet . 
Oh , we shall get on together , Karamazov ! 
Do you know , what delights me most , is that you treat me quite like an equal . 
But we are not equals , no , we are not , you are better ! 
But we shall get on . 
Do you know , all this last month , I 've been saying to myself , ` Either we shall be friends at once , for ever , or we shall part enemies to the grave ! ' '' 
`` And saying that , of course , you loved me , '' Alyosha laughed gaily . 
`` I did . 
I loved you awfully . 
I 've been loving and dreaming of you . 
And how do you know it all beforehand ? 
Ah , here 's the doctor . 
Goodness ! 
What will he tell us ? 
Look at his face ! '' 
Ilusha THE doctor came out of the room again , muffled in his fur coat and with his cap on his head . 
His face looked almost angry and disgusted , as though he were afraid of getting dirty . 
He cast a cursory glance round the passage , looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so . 
Alyosha waved from the door to the coachman , and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up . 
The captain darted out after the doctor , and , bowing apologetically , stopped him to get the last word . 
The poor fellow looked utterly crushed ; there was a scared look in his eyes . 
`` Your Excellency , your Excellency ... is it possible ? '' 
he began , but could not go on and clasped his hands in despair . 
Yet he still gazed imploringly at the doctor , as though a word from him might still change the poor boy 's fate . 
`` I ca n't help it , I am not God ! '' 
the doctor answered offhand , though with the customary impressiveness . 
`` Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon , soon ? '' 
`` You must be prepared for anything , '' said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones , and dropping his eyes , he was about to step out to the coach . 
`` Your Excellency , for Christ 's sake ! '' 
the terror-stricken captain stopped him again . 
`` Your Excellency ! 
But can nothing , absolutely nothing save him now ? '' 
`` It 's not in my hands now , '' said the doctor impatiently , `` but h 'm ! 
... '' he stopped suddenly . 
`` If you could , for instance ... send ... your patient ... at once , without delay '' -LRB- the words `` at once , without delay , '' the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start -RRB- `` to Syracuse , the change to the new be-ne-ficial `` To Syracuse ! '' 
cried the captain , unable to grasp what was said . 
`` Syracuse is in Sicily , '' Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation . 
The doctor looked at him . 
`` Sicily ! 
Your Excellency , '' faltered the captain , `` but you 've seen '' - he spread out his hands , indicating his surroundings - `` mamma and my family ? ''
