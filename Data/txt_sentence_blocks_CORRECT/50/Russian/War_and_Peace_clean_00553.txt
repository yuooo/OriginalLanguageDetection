On Konovnitsyn 's handsome , resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever , there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs , but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance . 
`` Well , what is it ? 
From whom ? '' 
he asked immediately but without hurry , blinking at the light . 
While listening to the officer 's report Konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch . 
Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots . 
Then he took off his nightcap , combed his hair over his temples , and donned his cap . 
`` Did you get here quickly ? 
Let us go to his Highness . '' 
Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost . 
He did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad . 
That did not interest him . 
He regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else . 
There was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well , but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it , but must only attend to one 's own work . 
And he did his work , giving his whole strength to the task . 
Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn , like Dokhturov , seems to have been included merely for propriety 's sake in the list of the so-called heroes of 1812 -- the Barclays , Raevskis , Ermolovs , Platovs , and Miloradoviches . 
Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information , and like Dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult . 
Since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open , giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up . 
In battle he was always under fire , so that Kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front , and like Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that , without clatter or noise , constitute the most essential part of the machine . 
Coming out of the hut into the damp , dark night Konovnitsyn frowned - partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him , of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news , especially Bennigsen , who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers drawn with Kutuzov ; and how they would make suggestions , quarrel , issue orders , and rescind them . 
And this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped . 
And in fact Toll , to whom he went to communicate the news , immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters , until Konovnitsyn , who listened in weary silence , reminded him that they must go to see his Highness . 
Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night . 
He often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime , but at night , lying on his bed without undressing , he generally remained awake thinking . 
So he lay now on his bed , supporting his large , heavy , scarred head on his plump hand , with his one eye open , meditating and peering into the darkness . 
Since Bennigsen , who corresponded with the Emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff , had begun to avoid him , Kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements . 
The lesson of the Tarutino battle and of the day before it , which Kutuzov remembered with pain , must , he thought , have some effect on others too . 
`` They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive . 
Patience and time are my warriors , my champions , '' thought Kutuzov . 
He knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green . 
It will fall of itself when ripe , but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled , the tree is harmed , and your teeth are set on edge . 
Like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded , and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it , but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question . 
Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthelemi having been sent , and by the reports of the guerrillas , Kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal . 
But he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait . 
`` They want to run to see how they have wounded it . 
Wait and we shall see ! 
Continual maneuvers , continual advances ! '' 
thought he . 
`` What for ? 
Only to distinguish themselves ! 
As if fighting were fun . 
They are like children from whom one ca n't get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight . 
But that 's not what is needed now . 
`` And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me ! 
It seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies '' -LRB- he remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg -RRB- `` they have foreseen everything . 
But the contingencies are endless . '' 
The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodino was mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov 's head for a whole month . 
On the one hand the French had occupied Moscow . 
On the other Kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal . 
But in any case proofs were needed ; he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited .
