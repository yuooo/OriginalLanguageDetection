muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper . 
`` What , Monsieur Pierre ... Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul ? '' 
said the little princess , smiling and drawing her work nearer to her . 
`` Oh ! 
Oh ! '' 
exclaimed several voices . 
`` Capital ! '' 
said Prince Hippolyte in English , and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand . 
The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders . 
Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued . 
`` I say so , '' he continued desperately , `` because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy , and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it , and so for the general good , he could not stop short for the sake of one man 's life . '' 
`` Wo n't you come over to the other table ? '' 
suggested Anna Pavlovna . 
But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her . 
`` No , '' cried he , becoming more and more eager , `` Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution , suppressed its abuses , preserved all that was good in it -- equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press -- and only for that reason did he obtain power . '' 
`` Yes , if having obtained power , without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king , I should have called him a great man , '' remarked the vicomte . 
`` He could not do that . 
The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man . 
The Revolution was a grand thing ! '' 
continued Monsieur Pierre , betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind . 
`` What ? 
Revolution and regicide a grand thing ? 
... Well , after that ... But wo n't you come to this other table ? '' 
repeated Anna Pavlovna . 
`` Rousseau 's Contrat social , '' said the vicomte with a tolerant smile . 
`` I am not speaking of regicide , I am speaking about ideas . '' 
`` Yes : ideas of robbery , murder , and regicide , '' again interjected an ironical voice . 
`` Those were extremes , no doubt , but they are not what is most important . 
What is important are the rights of man , emancipation from prejudices , and equality of citizenship , and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force . '' 
`` Liberty and equality , '' said the vicomte contemptuously , as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were , `` high-sounding words which have long been discredited . 
Who does not love liberty and equality ? 
Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality . 
Have people since the Revolution become happier ? 
On the contrary . 
We wanted liberty , but Buonaparte has destroyed it . '' 
Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess . 
In the first moment of Pierre 's outburst Anna Pavlovna , despite her social experience , was horror-struck . 
But when she saw that Pierre 's sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte , and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him , she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator . 
`` But , my dear Monsieur Pierre , '' said she , `` how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc -- or even an ordinary man who -- is innocent and untried ? '' 
`` I should like , '' said the vicomte , `` to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire ; was not that an imposture ? 
It was a swindle , and not at all like the conduct of a great man ! '' 
`` And the prisoners he killed in Africa ? 
That was horrible ! '' 
said the little princess , shrugging her shoulders . 
`` He 's a low fellow , say what you will , '' remarked Prince Hippolyte . 
Pierre , not knowing whom to answer , looked at them all and smiled . 
His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people . 
When he smiled , his grave , even rather gloomy , look was instantaneously replaced by another -- a childlike , kindly , even rather silly look , which seemed to ask forgiveness . 
The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested . 
All were silent .
