`` Is it possible ? '' 
exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna . 
`` Oh , how awful ! 
It is terrible to think ... . 
This is my son , '' she added , indicating Boris . 
`` He wanted to thank you himself . '' 
Boris bowed again politely . 
`` Believe me , Prince , a mother 's heart will never forget what you have done for us . '' 
`` I am glad I was able to do you a service , my dear Anna Mikhaylovna , '' said Prince Vasili , arranging his lace frill , and in tone and manner , here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation , assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer 's reception . 
`` Try to serve well and show yourself worthy , '' added he , addressing Boris with severity . 
`` I am glad ... . 
Are you here on leave ? '' 
he went on in his usual tone of indifference . 
`` I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment , your excellency , '' replied Boris , betraying neither annoyance at the prince 's brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation , but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance . 
`` Are you living with your mother ? '' 
`` I am living at Countess Rostova 's , '' replied Boris , again adding , `` your excellency . '' 
`` That is , with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna . 
`` I know , I know , '' answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice . 
`` I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear ! 
A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow , and a gambler too , I am told . '' 
`` But a very kind man , Prince , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile , as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure , but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man . 
`` What do the doctors say ? '' 
asked the princess after a pause , her worn face again expressing deep sorrow . 
`` They give little hope , '' replied the prince . 
`` And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Boris . 
He is his godson , '' she added , her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction . 
Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned . 
Anna Mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov 's fortune , and hastened to reassure him . 
`` If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle , '' said she , uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern , `` I know his character : noble , upright ... but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses ... . 
They are still young ... '' She bent her head and continued in a whisper : `` Has he performed his final duty , Prince ? 
How priceless are those last moments ! 
It can make things no worse , and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill . 
We women , Prince , '' and she smiled tenderly , `` always know how to say these things . 
I absolutely must see him , however painful it may be for me . 
I am used to suffering . '' 
Evidently the prince understood her , and also understood , as he had done at Anna Pavlovna 's , that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikhaylovna . 
`` Would not such a meeting be too trying for him , dear Anna Mikhaylovna ? '' 
said he . 
`` Let us wait until evening . 
The doctors are expecting a crisis . '' 
`` But one can not delay , Prince , at such a moment ! 
Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake . 
Ah , it is awful : the duties of a Christian ... '' A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses , the count 's niece , entered with a cold , stern face . 
The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs . 
Prince Vasili turned to her . 
`` Well , how is he ? '' 
`` Still the same ; but what can you expect , this noise ... '' said the princess , looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger . 
`` Ah , my dear , I hardly knew you , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy smile , ambling lightly up to the count 's niece . 
`` I have come , and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle . 
I imagine what you have gone through , '' and she sympathetically turned up her eyes .
