Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running . 
He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan 's left foot was still resting , and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in . 
`` I am going with you ! '' 
he kept shouting , laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face . 
`` Take me , too . '' 
`` There ! '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , delighted . 
`` Did I not say he was von Sohn . 
It is von Sohn himself , risen from the dead . 
Why , how did you tear yourself away ? 
What did you von Sohn there ? 
And how could you get away from the dinner ? 
You must be a brazen-faced fellow ! 
I am that myself , but I am surprised at you , brother ! 
Jump in , jump in ! 
Let him pass , Ivan . 
It will be fun . 
He can lie somewhere at our feet . 
Will you lie at our feet , von Sohn ? 
Or perch on the box with the coachman . 
Skip on to the box , von Sohn ! '' 
But Ivan , who had by now taken his seat , without a word gave Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying . 
It was quite by chance he did not fall . 
`` Drive on ! '' 
Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman . 
`` Why , what are you doing , what are you about ? 
Why did you do that ? '' 
Fyodor Pavlovitch protested . 
But the carriage had already driven away . 
Ivan made no reply . 
`` Well , you are a fellow , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch said again . 
After a pause of two minutes , looking askance at his son , `` Why , it was you got up all this monastery business . 
You urged it , you approved of it . 
Why are you angry now ? '' 
`` You 've talked rot enough . 
You might rest a bit now , '' Ivan snapped sullenly . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes . 
`` A drop of brandy would be nice now , '' he observed sententiously , but Ivan made no response . 
`` You shall have some , too , when we get home . '' 
Ivan was still silent . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes . 
`` But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery , though you will dislike it so much , most honoured Karl von Moor . '' 
Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously , and turning away stared at the road . 
And they did not speak again all the way home . 
The Sensualists In the Servants ' Quarters THE Karamazovs ' house was far from being in the centre of the town , but it was not quite outside it . 
It was a pleasant-looking old house of two stories , painted grey , with a red iron roof . 
It was roomy and snug , and might still last many years . 
There were all sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases . 
There were rats in it , but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them . 
`` One does n't feel so solitary when one 's left alone in the evening , '' he used to say .
