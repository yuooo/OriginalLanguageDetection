`` Do n't trouble ; it is cold , but I do n't often catch cold . 
Let us go in , though , and , by the way , what is your name ? 
I know you are called Kolya , but what else ? '' 
`` Nikolay - Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin , or , as they say in official documents , ` Krassotkin son . ' '' 
Kolya laughed for some reason , but added suddenly , `` Of course I hate my name Nikolay . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` It 's so trivial , so ordinary . '' 
`` You are thirteen ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` No , fourteen - that is , I shall be fourteen very soon , in a fortnight . 
I 'll confess one weakness of mine , Karamazov , just to you , since it 's our first meeting , so that you may understand my character at once . 
I hate being asked my age , more than that ... and in fact ... there 's a libellous story going about me , that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys . 
It 's a fact that I did play with them , but it 's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own amusement . 
I have reasons for believing that you 've heard the story ; but I was n't playing for my own amusement , it was for the sake of the children , because they could n't think of anything to do by themselves . 
But they 've always got some silly tale . 
This is an awful town for gossip , I can tell you . '' 
`` But what if you had been playing for your own amusement , what 's the harm ? '' 
`` Come , I say , for my own amusement ! 
You do n't play horses , do you ? '' 
`` But you must look at it like this , '' said Alyosha , smiling . 
`` Grown-up people go to the theatre and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes are represented - sometimes there are robbers and battles , too - and is n't that just the same thing , in a different form , of course ? 
And young people 's games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in its first stage . 
You know , they spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young . 
And sometimes these games are much better than performances in the theatre ; the only difference is that people go there to look at the actors , while in these games the young people are the actors themselves . 
But that 's only natural . '' 
`` You think so ? 
Is that your idea ? '' 
Kolya looked at him intently . 
`` Oh , you know , that 's rather an interesting view . 
When I go home , I 'll think it over . 
I 'll admit I thought I might learn something from you . 
I 've come to learn of you , Karamazov , '' Kolya concluded , in a voice full of spontaneous feeling . 
`` And I of you , '' said Alyosha , smiling and pressing his hand . 
Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha . 
What struck him most was that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he were `` quite grown up . '' 
`` I 'll show you something directly , Karamazov ; it 's a theatrical performance , too , '' he said , laughing nervously . 
`` That 's why I 've come . '' 
`` Let us go first to the people of the house , on the left . 
All the boys leave their coats in there , because the room is small and hot . '' 
`` Oh , I 'm only coming in for a minute . 
I 'll keep on my overcoat . 
Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead . 
Ici , Perezvon , lie down and be dead ! 
You see how he 's dead . 
I 'll go in first and explore , then I 'll whistle to him when I think fit , and you 'll see , he 'll dash in like mad . 
Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment . 
I 'll arrange it all and you 'll see something . '' 
By Ilusha 's Bedside THE room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is already familiar to the reader . 
It was close and crowded at that moment with a number of visitors . 
Several boys were sitting with Ilusha , and though all of them , like Smurov , were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha , it was really the fact .
