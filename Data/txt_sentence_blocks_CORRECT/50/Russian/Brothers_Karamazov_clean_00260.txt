Kalgonov went off into the most childish laughter , almost falling on the sofa . 
Grushenka , too , laughed . 
Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness . 
`` Do you know , that 's the truth , he 's not lying now , '' exclaimed Kalganov , turning to Mitya ; `` and do you know , he 's been married twice ; it 's his first wife he 's talking about . 
But his second wife , do you know , ran away , and is alive now . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
said Mitya , turning quickly to Maximov with an expression of the utmost astonishment . 
`` Yes . 
She did run away . 
I 've had that unpleasant experience , '' Maximov modestly assented , `` with a monsieur . 
And what was worse , she 'd had all my little property transferred to her beforehand . 
` You 're an educated man , ' she said to me . 
` You can always get your living . ' 
She settled my business with that . 
A venerable bishop once said to me : ` One of your wives was lame , but the other was too light-footed . ' 
He he ! 
`` Listen , listen ! '' 
cried Kalganov , bubbling over , `` if he 's telling lies - and he often is - he 's only doing it to amuse us all . 
There 's no harm in that , is there ? 
You know , I sometimes like him . 
He 's awfully low , but it 's natural to him , eh ? 
Do n't you think so ? 
Some people are low from self-interest , but he 's simply so , from nature . 
Only fancy , he claims -LRB- he was arguing about it all the way yesterday -RRB- that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him . 
Do you remember , there 's a landowner called Maximov in it , whom Nozdryov thrashed . 
He was charged , do you remember , ` for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition . ' 
Would you believe it , he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten ! 
Now can it be so ? 
Tchitchikov made his journey , at the very latest , at the beginning of the twenties , so that the dates do n't fit . 
He could n't have been thrashed then , he could n't , could he ? '' 
It was diffcult to imagine what Kalgonov was excited about , but his excitement was genuine . 
Mitya followed his lead without protest . 
`` Well , but if they did thrash him ! '' 
he cried , laughing . 
`` It 's not that they thrashed me exactly , but what I mean is - '' put in Maximov . 
`` What do you mean ? 
Either they thrashed you or they did n't . '' 
`` What o'clock is it , panie ? '' 
the Pole , with the pipe , asked his tall friend , with a bored expression . 
The other shrugged his shoulders in reply . 
Neither of them had a watch . 
`` Why not talk ? 
Let other people talk . 
Must n't other people talk because you 're bored ? '' 
Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding fault . 
Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya 's mind . 
This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability . 
`` Pani , I did n't oppose it . 
I did n't say anything . '' 
`` All right then .
