Where did you get your wig from ? 
He was a falcon , but this is a gander . 
He used to laugh and sing to me ... . 
And I 've been crying for five years , damned fool , abject , shameless I was ! 
She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands . 
At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left - a rollicking dance song . 
`` A regular Sodom ! '' 
Vrublevsky roared suddenly . 
`` Landlord , send the shameless hussies away ! '' 
The landlord , who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door , hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarrelling , at once entered the room . 
`` What are you shouting for ? 
D'you want to split your throat ? '' 
he said , addressing Vrublevsky , with surprising rudeness . 
`` Animal ! '' 
bellowed Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Animal ? 
And what sort of cards were you playing with just now ? 
I gave you a pack and you hid it . 
You played with marked cards ! 
I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards , d'you know that , for it 's just the same as false banknotes ... And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion , and pulled out an unopened pack of cards . 
`` Here 's my pack unopened ! '' 
He held it up and showed it to all in the room . 
`` From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away , and put his in place of it - you 're a cheat and not a gentleman ! '' 
`` And I twice saw the pan change a card ! '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` How shameful ! 
How shameful ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , clasping her hands , and blushing for genuine shame . 
`` Good Lord , he 's come to that ! '' 
`` I thought so , too ! '' 
said Mitya . 
But before he had uttered the words , Vrublevsky , with a confused and infuriated face , shook his fist at Grushenka , shouting : `` You low harlot ! '' 
Mitya flew at him at once , clutched him in both hands , lifted him in the air , and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right , from which they had just come . 
`` I 've laid him on the floor , there , '' he announced , returning at once , gasping with excitement . 
`` He 's struggling , the scoundrel ! 
But he wo n't come back , no fear of that ! 
... '' He closed one half of the folding doors , and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole : `` Most illustrious , will you please to retire as well ? '' 
`` My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' said Trifon Borissovitch , `` make them give you back the money you lost . 
It 's as good as stolen from you . '' 
`` I do n't want my fifty roubles back , '' Kalgonov declared suddenly . 
`` I do n't want my two hundred , either , '' cried Mitya , `` I would n't take it for anything ! 
Let him keep it as a consolation . '' 
`` Bravo , Mitya ! 
You 're a trump , Mitya ! '' 
cried Grushenka , and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation . 
The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity , was making for the door , but he stopped short and said suddenly , addressing Grushenka : `` Pani , if you want to come with me , come . 
If not , good-bye . '' 
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door . 
This was a man of character : he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed , he still expected that she would marry him . 
Mitya slammed the door after him .
