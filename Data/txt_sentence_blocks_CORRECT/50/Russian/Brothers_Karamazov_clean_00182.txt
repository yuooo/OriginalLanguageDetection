It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through . 
I stood as if I were struck dumb , while the sun was shining , the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the praise of God ... . 
I hid my face in my hands , fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears . 
And then I remembered by brother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants : `` My dear ones , why do you wait on me , why do you love me , am I worth your waiting on me ? '' 
`` Yes , am I worth it ? '' 
flashed through my mind . 
`` After all what am I worth , that another man , a fellow creature , made in the likeness and image of God , should serve me ? '' 
For the first time in my life this question forced itself upon me . 
He had said , `` Mother , my little heart , in truth we are each responsible to all for all , it 's only that men do n't know this . 
If they knew it , the world would be a paradise at once . '' 
`` God , can that too be false ? '' 
I thought as I wept . 
`` In truth , perhaps , I am more than all others responsible for all , a greater sinner than all men in the world . '' 
And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared to me : what was I going to do ? 
I was going to kill a good , clever , noble man , who had done me no wrong , and by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life , I should be torturing and killing her too . 
I lay thus in my bed with my face in the pillow , heedless how the time was passing . 
Suddenly my second , the ensign , came in with the pistols to fetch me . 
`` Ah , '' said he , `` it 's a good thing you are up already , it 's time we were off , come along ! '' 
I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided ; we went out to the carriage , however . 
`` Wait here a minute , '' I said to him . 
`` I 'll be back directly , I have forgotten my purse . '' 
And I ran back alone , to Afanasy 's little room . 
`` Afanasy , '' I said , `` I gave you two blows on the face yesterday , forgive me , '' I said . 
He started as though he were frightened , and looked at me ; and I saw that it was not enough , and on the spot , in my full officer 's uniform , I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground . 
`` Forgive me , '' I said . 
Then he was completely aghast . 
`` Your honour ... sir , what are you doing ? 
Am I worth it ? '' 
And he burst out crying as I had done before , hid his face in his hands , turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs . 
I flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage . 
`` Ready , '' I cried . 
`` Have you ever seen a conqueror ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` Here is one before you . '' 
I was in ecstasy , laughing and talking all the way , I do n't remember what about . 
He looked at me . 
`` Well , brother , you are a plucky fellow , you 'll keep up the honour of the uniform , I can see . '' 
So we reached the place and found them there , waiting us . 
We were placed twelve paces apart ; he had the first shot . 
I stood gaily , looking him full in the face ; I did not twitch an eyelash , I looked lovingly at him , for I knew what I would do . 
His shot just grazed my cheek and ear . 
`` Thank God , '' I cried , `` no man has been killed , '' and I seized my pistol , turned back and flung it far away into the wood . 
`` That 's the place for you , '' I cried . 
I turned to my adversary . 
`` Forgive me , young fool that I am , sir , '' I said , `` for my unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me . 
I am ten times worse than you and more , maybe . 
Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the world . '' 
I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me . 
`` Upon my word , '' cried my adversary , annoyed , `` if you did not want to fight , why did not you let me alone ? '' 
`` Yesterday I was a fool , to-day I know better , '' I answered him gaily .
