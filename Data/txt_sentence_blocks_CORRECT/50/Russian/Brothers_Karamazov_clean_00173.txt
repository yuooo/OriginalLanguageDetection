Mind you do come . 
I shall always be glad to see you . 
Well , Christ be with you ! '' 
Ivan got into the carriage . 
`` Good-bye , Ivan ! 
Do n't be too hard on me ! '' 
the father called for the last time . 
The whole household came out to take leave - Smerdyakov , Marfa and Grigory . 
Ivan gave them ten roubles each . 
When he had seated himself in the carriage , Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug . 
`` You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya , '' broke suddenly from Ivan . 
Again , as the day before , the words seemed to drop of themselves , and he laughed , too , a peculiar , nervous laugh . 
He remembered it long after . 
`` It 's a true saying then , that ` it 's always worth while speaking to a clever man , ' '' answered Smerdyakov firmly , looking significantly at Ivan . 
The carriage rolled away . 
Nothing was clear in Ivan 's soul , but he looked eagerly around him at the fields , at the hills , at the trees , at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky . 
And all of a sudden he felt very happy . 
He tried to talk to the driver , and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him ; but a minute later he realised that he was not catching anything , and that he had not really even taken in the peasant 's answer . 
He was silent , and it was pleasant even so . 
The air was pure and cool , sky bright . 
The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind . 
But he softly smiled , blew softly on the friendly phantoms , and they flew away . 
`` There 's plenty of time for them , '' he thought . 
They reached the station quickly , changed horses , and galloped to Volovya `` Why is it worth while speaking to a clever man ? 
What did he mean by that ? '' 
The thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing . 
`` And why did I tell him I was going to Tchermashnya ? '' 
They reached Volovya station . 
Ivan got out of the carriage , and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya . 
He told them to harness the horses . 
He went into the station house , looked round , glanced at the overseer 's wife , and suddenly went back to the entrance . 
`` I wo n't go to Tchermashnya . 
Am I too late to reach the railway by seven , brothers ? '' 
`` We shall just do it . 
Shall we get the carriage out ? '' 
`` At once . 
Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow ? '' 
`` To be sure . 
Mitri here will . '' 
`` Can you do me a service , Mitri ? 
Go to my father 's , to Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov , and tell him I have n't gone to Tchermashnya . 
Can you ? '' 
`` Of course I can . 
I 've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time . '' 
`` And here 's something for you , for I dare say he wo n't give you anything , '' said Ivan , laughing gaily . 
`` You may depend on it he wo n't . '' 
Mitri laughed too . 
`` Thank you , sir . 
I 'll be sure to do it . '' 
At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow .
