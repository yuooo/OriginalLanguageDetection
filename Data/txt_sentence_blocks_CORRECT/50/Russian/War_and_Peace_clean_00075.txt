As soon as Rostov heard them , an enormous load of doubt fell from him . 
He was glad , and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him , but the task he had begun had to be completed . 
`` Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine , '' muttered Telyanin , taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room . 
`` We must have an explanation ... '' `` I know it and shall prove it , '' said Rostov . 
`` I. . . '' 
Every muscle of Telyanin 's pale , terrified face began to quiver , his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rostov 's face , and his sobs were audible . 
`` Count ! 
... Do n't ruin a young fellow ... here is this wretched money , take it ... '' He threw it on the table . 
`` I have an old father and mother ! 
... '' Rostov took the money , avoiding Telyanin 's eyes , and went out of the room without a word . 
But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps . 
`` O God , '' he said with tears in his eyes , `` how could you do it ? '' 
`` Count ... '' said Telyanin drawing nearer to him . 
`` Do n't touch me , '' said Rostov , drawing back . 
`` If you need it , take the money , '' and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn . 
That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron 's officers in Denisov 's quarters . 
`` And I tell you , Rostov , that you must apologize to the colonel ! '' 
said a tall , grizzly-haired staff captain , with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features , to Rostov who was crimson with excitement . 
The staff captain , Kirsten , had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission . 
`` I will allow no one to call me a liar ! '' 
cried Rostov . 
`` He told me I lied , and I told him he lied . 
And there it rests . 
He may keep me on duty every day , or may place me under arrest , but no one can make me apologize , because if he , as commander of this regiment , thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction , then ... '' `` You just wait a moment , my dear fellow , and listen , '' interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass , calmly stroking his long mustache . 
`` You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen ... '' `` I 'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers . 
Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them , but I am not a diplomatist . 
That 's why I joined the hussars , thinking that here one would not need finesse ; and he tells me that I am lying -- so let him give me satisfaction ... '' `` That 's all right . 
No one thinks you a coward , but that 's not the point . 
Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander ? '' 
Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation , evidently with no wish to take part in it . 
He answered the staff captain 's question by a disapproving shake of his head . 
`` You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers , '' continued the staff captain , `` and Bogdanich '' -LRB- the colonel was called Bogdanich -RRB- `` shuts you up . '' 
`` He did not shut me up , he said I was telling an untruth . '' 
`` Well , have it so , and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize . '' 
`` Not on any account ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov . 
`` I did not expect this of you , '' said the staff captain seriously and severely . 
`` You do n't wish to apologize , but , man , it 's not only to him but to the whole regiment -- all of us -- you 're to blame all round . 
The case is this : you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice ; but no , you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers . 
Now what was the colonel to do ? 
Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment ? 
Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel ? 
Is that how you look at it ? 
We do n't see it like that . 
And Bogdanich was a brick : he told you you were saying what was not true . 
It 's not pleasant , but what 's to be done , my dear fellow ? 
You landed yourself in it . 
And now , when one wants to smooth the thing over , some conceit prevents your apologizing , and you wish to make the whole affair public . 
You are offended at being put on duty a bit , but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer ? 
Whatever Bogdanich may be , anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel !
