The children 's faces instantly brightened . 
`` Show us the cannon , '' said Kostya , beaming all over . 
Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel , and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table . 
`` Ah , you are bound to ask that ! 
Look , it 's on wheels . '' 
He rolled the toy on along the table . 
`` And it can be fired off , too . 
It can be loaded with shot and fired off . '' 
`` And it could kill anyone ? '' 
`` It can kill anyone ; you 've only got to aim at anybody , '' and Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put , where the shot should be rolled in , showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole , and told them that it kicked when it was fired . 
The children listened with intense interest . 
What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked . 
`` And have you got any powder ? '' 
Nastya inquired . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Show us the powder , too , '' she drawled with a smile of entreaty . 
Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder . 
He had some shot , too , in a screw of paper . 
He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his hand . 
`` One has to be careful there 's no fire about , or it would blow up and kill us all , '' Krassotkin warned them sensationally . 
The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment . 
But Kostya liked the shot better . 
`` And does the shot burn ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` No , it does n't . '' 
`` Give me a little shot , '' he asked in an imploring voice . 
`` I 'll give you a little shot ; here , take it , but do n't show it to your mother till I come back , or she 'll be sure to think it 's gunpowder , and will die of fright and give you a thrashing . '' 
`` Mother never does whip us , '' Nastya observed at once . 
`` I know , I only said it to finish the sentence . 
And do n't you ever deceive your mother except just this once , until I come back . 
And so , kiddies , can I go out ? 
You wo n't be frightened and cry when I 'm gone ? '' 
`` We sha-all cry , '' drawled Kostya , on the verge of tears already . 
`` We shall cry , we shall be sure to cry , '' Nastya chimed in with timid haste . 
`` Oh , children , children , how fraught with peril are your years ! 
There 's no help for it , chickens ; I shall have to stay with you I do n't know how long . 
And time is passing , time is passing , oogh ! '' 
`` Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead ! '' 
Kostya begged . 
`` There 's no help for it , we must have recourse to Perezvon . 
Ici , Perezvon . '' 
And Kolya began giving orders to the dog , who performed all his tricks . 
He was a rough-haired dog , of medium size , with a coat of a sort of lilac-grey colour . 
He was blind in his right eye , and his left ear was torn . 
He whined and jumped , stood and walked on his hind legs , lay on his back with his paws in the air , rigid as though he were dead . 
While this last performance was going on , the door opened and Agafya , Madame Krassotkin 's servant , a stout woman of forty , marked with small-pox , appeared in the doorway . 
She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand . 
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog . 
Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return , he did not cut short the performance , and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time , at last he whistled to him . 
The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty .
