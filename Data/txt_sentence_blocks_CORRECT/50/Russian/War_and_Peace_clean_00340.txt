Prince Andrew , greatly changed and plainly in better health , but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows , stood in civilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshcherski , warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating . 
The conversation was about Speranski -- the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow . 
`` Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago , '' Prince Andrew was saying , `` and by those who were unable to understand his aims . 
To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other men 's mistakes is very easy , but I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him , by him alone . '' 
He paused at the sight of Pierre . 
His face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression . 
`` Posterity will do him justice , '' he concluded , and at once turned to Pierre . 
`` Well , how are you ? 
Still getting stouter ? '' 
he said with animation , but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened . 
`` Yes , I am well , '' he said in answer to Pierre 's question , and smiled . 
To Pierre that smile said plainly : `` I am well , but my health is now of no use to anyone . '' 
After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish frontier , about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre , and about M. Dessalles , whom he had brought from abroad to be his son 's tutor , Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Speranski which was still going on between the two old men . 
`` If there were treason , or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon , they would have been made public , '' he said with warmth and haste . 
`` I do not , and never did , like Speranski personally , but I like justice ! '' 
Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar , to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate . 
When Prince Meshcherski had left , Prince Andrew took Pierre 's arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him . 
A bed had been made up there , and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about . 
Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket , from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper . 
He did it all silently and very quickly . 
He stood up and coughed . 
His face was gloomy and his lips compressed . 
`` Forgive me for troubling you ... '' Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha , and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy . 
This expression irritated Prince Andrew , and in a determined , ringing , and unpleasant tone he continued : `` I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand , or something of that kind . 
Is that true ? '' 
`` Both true and untrue , '' Pierre began ; but Prince Andrew interrupted him . 
`` Here are her letters and her portrait , '' said he . 
He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre . 
`` Give this to the countess ... if you see her . '' 
`` She is very ill , '' said Pierre . 
`` Then she is here still ? '' 
said Prince Andrew . 
`` And Prince Kuragin ? '' 
he added quickly . 
`` He left long ago . 
She has been at death 's door . '' 
`` I much regret her illness , '' said Prince Andrew ; and he smiled like his father , coldly , maliciously , and unpleasantly . 
`` So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his hand ? '' 
said Prince Andrew , and he snorted several times . 
`` He could not marry , for he was married already , '' said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably , again reminding one of his father . 
`` And where is your brother-in-law now , if I may ask ? '' 
he said . 
`` He has gone to Peters ... But I do n't know , '' said Pierre . 
`` Well , it does n't matter , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Tell Countess Rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good . '' 
Pierre took the packet . 
Prince Andrew , as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say , or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything , looked fixedly at him . 
`` I say , do you remember our discussion in Petersburg ? '' 
asked Pierre , `` about ... '' `` Yes , '' returned Prince Andrew hastily .
