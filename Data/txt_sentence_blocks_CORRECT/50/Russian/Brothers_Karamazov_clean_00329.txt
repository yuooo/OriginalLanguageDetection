`` Have you noticed , Smurov , that in the middle of winter we do n't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now , in the beginning of winter , when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees , especially when there is not much snow . 
It 's because people are not used to it . 
Everything is habit with men , everything even in their social and political relations . 
Habit is the great motive-power . 
What a funny-looking peasant ! '' 
Kolya pointed to a tall peasant , with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat , who was standing by his wagon , clapping together his hands , in their shapeless leather gloves , to warm them . 
His long fair beard was all white with frost . 
`` That peasant 's beard 's frozen , '' Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him . 
`` Lots of people 's beards are frozen , '' the peasant replied , calmly and sententiously . 
`` Do n't provoke him , '' observed Smurov . 
`` It 's all right ; he wo n't be cross ; he 's a nice fellow . 
Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . '' 
`` Is your name Matvey ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Did n't you know ? '' 
`` No , I did n't . 
It was a guess . '' 
`` You do n't say so ! 
You are a schoolboy , I suppose ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You get whipped , I expect ? '' 
`` Nothing to speak of - sometimes . '' 
`` Does it hurt ? '' 
`` Well , yes , it does . '' 
`` Ech , what a life ! '' 
The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his heart . 
`` Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . 
You are a nice chap , that you are . '' 
The boys went on . 
`` That was a nice peasant , '' Kolya observed to Smurov . 
`` I like talking to the peasants , and am always glad to do them justice . '' 
`` Why did you tell a lie , pretending we are thrashed ? '' 
asked Smurov . 
`` I had to say that to please him . '' 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
`` You know , Smurov , I do n't like being asked the same thing twice . 
I like people to understand at the first word . 
Some things ca n't be explained . 
According to a peasant 's notions , schoolboys are whipped , and must be whipped . 
What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped ? 
And if I were to tell him we are not , he 'd be disappointed . 
But you do n't understand that . 
One has to know how to talk to the peasants . '' 
`` Only do n't tease them , please , or you 'll get into another scrape as you did about that goose . '' 
`` So you 're afraid ? '' 
`` Do n't laugh , Kolya . 
Of course I 'm afraid . 
My father would be awfully cross .
