We 'll make up for it now . '' 
`` Why does he come here so often ? 
Surely you are not such great friends ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
He , too , nodded at the door through which Rakitin had disappeared . 
`` Great friends with Rakitin ? 
No , not as much as that . 
Is it likely - a pig like that ? 
He considers I am ... a blackguard . 
They ca n't understand a joke either , that 's the worst of such people . 
They never understand a joke , and their souls are dry , dry and flat ; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here . 
But he is a clever fellow , very clever . 
Well , Alexey , it 's all over with me now . '' 
He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him . 
`` Yes , the trial 's to-morrow . 
Are you so hopeless , brother ? '' 
Alyosha said , with an apprehensive feeling . 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
said Mitya , looking at him rather uncertainly . 
`` Oh , you mean the trial ! 
Damn it all ! 
Till now we 've been talking of things that do n't matter , about this trial , but I have n't said a word to you about the chief thing . 
Yes , the trial is to-morrow ; but it was n't the trial I meant , when I said it was all over with me . 
Why do you look at me so critically ? '' 
`` What do you mean , Mitya ? '' 
`` Ideas , ideas , that 's all ! 
Ethics ! 
What is ethics ? '' 
`` Ethics ? '' 
asked Alyosha , wondering . 
`` Yes ; is it a science ? '' 
`` Yes , there is such a science ... but ... I confess I ca n't explain to you what sort of science it is . '' 
`` Rakitin knows . 
Rakitin knows a lot , damn him ! 
He 's not going to be a monk . 
He means to go to Petersburg . 
There he 'll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency . 
Who knows , he may be of use and make his own career , too . 
Ough ! 
they are first-rate , these people , at making a career ! 
Damn ethics , I am done for , Alexey , I am , you man of God ! 
I love you more than anyone . 
It makes my heart yearn to look at you . 
Who was Karl Bernard ? '' 
`` Karl Bernard ? '' 
Alyosha was surprised again . 
`` No , not Karl . 
Stay , I made a mistake . 
Claude Bernard . 
What was he ?
