He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy . 
` For now ' -LRB- he is speaking of the Inquisition , of course -RRB- ` for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men . 
Man was created a rebel ; and how can rebels be happy ? 
Thou wast warned , ' he says to Him . 
` Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings , but Thou didst not listen to those warnings ; Thou didst reject the only way by which men might be made happy . 
But , fortunately , departing Thou didst hand on the work to us . 
Thou hast promised , Thou hast established by Thy word , Thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind , and now , of course , Thou canst not think of taking it away . 
Why , then , hast Thou come to hinder us ? ' '' 
`` And what 's the meaning of ` no lack of admonitions and warnings ' ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` Why , that 's the chief part of what the old man must say . '' 
` The wise and dread spirit , the spirit of self-destruction and non-existence , ' the old man goes on , great spirit talked with Thee in the wilderness , and we are told in the books that he `` tempted '' Thee . 
Is that so ? 
And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject , and what in the books is called `` the temptation '' ? 
And yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle , it took place on that day , on the day of the three temptations . 
The statement of those three questions was itself the miracle . 
If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books , and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew , and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth - rulers , chief priests , learned men , philosophers , poets - and had set them the task to invent three questions , such as would not only fit the occasion , but express in three words , three human phrases , the whole future history of the world and of humanity - dost Thou believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness ? 
From those questions alone , from the miracle of their statement , we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence , but with the absolute and eternal . 
For in those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is , as it were , brought together into one whole , and foretold , and in them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature . 
At the time it could not be so clear , since the future was unknown ; but now that fifteen hundred years have passed , we see that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and foretold , and has been so truly fulfilled , that nothing can be added to them or taken from them . 
`` Judge Thyself who was right - Thou or he who questioned Thee then ? 
Remember the first question ; its meaning , in other words , was this : `` Thou wouldst go into the world , and art going with empty hands , with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness can not even understand , which they fear and dread - for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom . 
But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness ? 
Turn them into bread , and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep , grateful and obedient , though for ever trembling , lest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread . '' 
But Thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer , thinking , what is that freedom worth if obedience is bought with bread ? 
Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone . 
But dost Thou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome Thee , and all will follow him , crying , `` Who can compare with this beast ? 
He has given us fire from heaven ! '' 
Dost Thou know that the ages will pass , and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime , and therefore no sin ; there is only hunger ? 
`` Feed men , and then ask of them virtue ! '' 
that 's what they 'll write on the banner , which they will raise against Thee , and with which they will destroy Thy temple . 
Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building ; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again , and though , like the one of old , it will not be finished , yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years ; for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower . 
They will seek us again , hidden underground in the catacombs , for we shall be again persecuted and tortured . 
They will find us and cry to us , `` Feed us , for those who have promised us fire from heaven have n't given it ! '' 
And then we shall finish building their tower , for he finishes the building who feeds them . 
And we alone shall feed them in Thy name , declaring falsely that it is in Thy name . 
Oh , never , never can they feed themselves without us ! 
No science will give them bread so long as they remain free . 
In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet , and say to us , `` Make us your slaves , but feed us . '' 
They will understand themselves , at last , that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together , for never , never will they be able to share between them ! 
They will be convinced , too , that they can never be free , for they are weak , vicious , worthless , and rebellious . 
Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven , but , I repeat again , can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak , ever sinful and ignoble race of man ? 
And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee , what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly ? 
Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong , while the millions , numerous as the sands of the sea , who are weak but love Thee , must exist only for the sake of the great and strong ? 
No , we care for the weak too . 
They are sinful and rebellious , but in the end they too will become obedient . 
They will marvel at us and look on us as gods , because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them - so awful it will seem to them to be free . 
But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name . 
We shall deceive them again , for we will not let Thee come to us again . 
That deception will be our suffering , for we shall be forced to lie . ''
