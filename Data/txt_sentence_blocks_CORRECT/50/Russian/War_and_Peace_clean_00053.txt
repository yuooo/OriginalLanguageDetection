she said . 
The face of the little princess changed . 
She sighed and said : `` Yes , quite certain . 
Ah ! 
it is very dreadful ... '' Her lip descended . 
She brought her face close to her sister-in-law 's and unexpectedly again began to cry . 
`` She needs rest , '' said Prince Andrew with a frown . 
`` Do n't you , Lise ? 
Take her to your room and I 'll go to Father . 
How is he ? 
Just the same ? '' 
`` Yes , just the same . 
Though I do n't know what your opinion will be , '' answered the princess joyfully . 
`` And are the hours the same ? 
And the walks in the avenues ? 
And the lathe ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that , in spite of all his love and respect for his father , he was aware of his weaknesses . 
`` The hours are the same , and the lathe , and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons , '' said Princess Mary gleefully , as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life . 
When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up , Tikhon came to call the young prince to his father . 
The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son 's arrival : he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner . 
The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style , wearing an antique coat and powdered hair ; and when Prince Andrew entered his father 's dressing room -LRB- not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms , but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre -RRB- , the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair , wrapped in a powdering mantle , entrusting his head to Tikhon . 
`` Ah ! 
here 's the warrior ! 
Wants to vanquish Buonaparte ? '' 
said the old man , shaking his powdered head as much as the tail , which Tikhon was holding fast to plait , would allow . 
`` You at least must tackle him properly , or else if he goes on like this he 'll soon have us , too , for his subjects ! 
How are you ? '' 
And he held out his cheek . 
The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner . 
-LRB- He used to say that a nap `` after dinner was silver -- before dinner , golden . '' -RRB- 
He cast happy , sidelong glances at his son from under his thick , bushy eyebrows . 
Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him . 
He made no reply on his father 's favorite topic -- making fun of the military men of the day , and more particularly of Bonaparte . 
`` Yes , Father , I have come come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant , '' said Prince Andrew , following every movement of his father 's face with an eager and respectful look . 
`` How is your health ? '' 
`` Only fools and rakes fall ill , my boy . 
You know me : I am busy from morning till night and abstemious , so of course I am well . '' 
`` Thank God , '' said his son smiling . 
`` God has nothing to do with it ! 
Well , go on , '' he continued , returning to his hobby ; `` tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ` strategy . ' '' 
Prince Andrew smiled . 
`` Give me time to collect my wits , Father , '' said he , with a smile that showed that his father 's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him . 
`` Why , I have not yet had time to settle down ! '' 
`` Nonsense , nonsense ! '' 
cried the old man , shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited , and grasping his by the hand . 
`` The house for your wife is ready . 
Princess Mary will take her there and show her over , and they 'll talk nineteen to the dozen . 
That 's their woman 's way ! 
I am glad to have her . 
Sit down and talk .
