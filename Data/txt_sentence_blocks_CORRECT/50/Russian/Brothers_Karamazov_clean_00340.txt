`` Of course he will , '' `` a mastiff , '' `` large , '' `` like this , '' `` as big as a calf , '' shouted several voices . 
`` As big as a calf , as a real calf , '' chimed in the captain . 
`` I got one like that on purpose , one of the fiercest breed , and his parents are huge and very fierce , they stand as high as this from the floor ... . 
Sit down here , on Ilusha 's bed , or here on the bench . 
You are welcome , we 've been hoping to see you a long time ... . 
You were so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed , at Ilusha 's feet . 
Though he had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way , now he completely lost the thread of it . 
`` No ... I came with Perezvon . 
I 've got a dog now , called Perezvon . 
A Slavonic name . 
He 's out there ... if I whistle , he 'll run in . 
I 've brought a dog , too , '' he said , addressing Ilusha all at once . 
`` Do you remember Zhutchka , old man ? '' 
he suddenly fired the question at him . 
Ilusha 's little face quivered . 
He looked with an agonised expression at Kolya . 
Alyosha , standing at the door , frowned and signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka , but he did not or would not notice . 
`` Where ... is Zhutchka ? '' 
Ilusha asked in a broken voice . 
`` Oh well , my boy , your Zhutchka 's lost and done for ! '' 
Ilusha did not speak , but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya . 
Alyosha , catching Kolya 's eye , signed to him vigourously again , but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed . 
`` It must have run away and died somewhere . 
It must have died after a meal like that , '' Kolya pronounced pitilessly , though he seemed a little breathless . 
`` But I 've got a dog , Perezvon ... A Slavonic name ... I 've brought him to show you . '' 
`` I do n't want him ! '' 
said Ilusha suddenly . 
`` No , no , you really must see him ... it will amuse you . 
I brought him on purpose ... . 
He 's the same sort of shaggy dog ... . 
You allow me to call in my dog , madam ? '' 
He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov , with inexplicable excitement in his manner . 
`` I do n't want him , I do n't want him ! '' 
cried Ilusha , with a mournful break in his voice . 
There was a reproachful light in his eyes . 
`` You 'd better , '' the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he had just sat down , `` you 'd better ... another time , '' he muttered , but Kolya could not be restrained . 
He hurriedly shouted to Smurov , `` Open the door , '' and as soon as it was open , he blew his whistle . 
Perezvon dashed headlong into the room . 
`` Jump , Perezvon , beg ! 
Beg ! '' 
shouted Kolya , jumping up , and the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha 's bedside . 
What followed was a surprise to everyone : Ilusha started , lurched violently forward , bent over Perezvon and gazed at him , faint with suspense . 
`` It 's ... Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried suddenly , in a voice breaking with joy and suffering . 
`` And who did you think it was ? '' 
Krassotkin shouted with all his might , in a ringing , happy voice , and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to Ilusha . 
`` Look , old man , you see , blind of one eye and the left ear is torn , just the marks you described to me . 
It was by that I found him . 
I found him directly .
