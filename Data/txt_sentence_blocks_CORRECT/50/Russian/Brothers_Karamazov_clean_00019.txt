Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this ? 
Believe me , I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you . 
I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on with you . 
Is there room for my humility beside your pride ? 
I am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you ! 
But now , I 'll be quiet ; I will keep quiet all the time . 
I 'll sit in a chair and hold my tongue . 
Now it is for you to speak , Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
You are the principal person left now - for ten minutes . '' 
Peasant Women Who Have Faith NEAR the wooden portico below , built on to the outer wall of the precinct , there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women . 
They had been told that the elder was at last coming out , and they had gathered together in anticipation . 
Two ladies , Madame Hohlakov and her daughter , had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder , but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank . 
Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady , still young and attractive , and always dressed with taste . 
She was rather pale , and had lively black eyes . 
She was not more than thirty-three , and had been five years a widow . 
Her daughter , a girl of fourteen , was partially paralysed . 
The poor child had not been able to walk for the last six months , and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair . 
She had a charming little face , rather thin from illness , but full of gaiety . 
There was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eyes with their long lashes . 
Her mother had been intending to take her abroad ever since the spring , but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate . 
They had been staying a week in our town , where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion , but had visited Father Zossima once already , three days before . 
Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw anyone , they had now suddenly turned up again , and urgently entreated `` the happiness of looking once again on the great healer . '' 
The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter 's invalid carriage , and two paces from her stood an old monk , not one of our monastery , but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north . 
He too sought the elder 's blessing . 
But Father Zossima , on entering the portico , went first straight to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into the portico . 
Father Zossima stood on the top step , put on his stole , and began blessing the women who thronged about him . 
One crazy woman was led up to him . 
As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth . 
Laying the stole on her forehead , he read a short prayer over her , and she was at once soothed and quieted . 
I do not know how it may be now , but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these `` possessed '' women in the villages and monasteries . 
They used to be brought to mass ; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church . 
But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it , at once the `` possession '' ceased , and the sick women were always soothed for a time . 
I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child ; but then I heard from country neighbours and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work , and that it could always be cured by suitable severity ; various anecdotes were told to confirm this . 
But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretence about it , that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject , especially prevalent among us in Russia , and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women . 
It is a disease , I was told , arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard , abnormal and unassisted labour in childbirth , and from the hopeless misery , from beatings , and so on , which some women were not able to endure like others . 
The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament , which had been explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the `` clericals , '' arose probably in the most natural manner . 
Both the women who supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it . 
And so , with a nervous and psychically deranged woman , a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place , and was bound to take place , at the moment of bowing down to the sacrament , aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass ; and it did come to pass , though only for a moment . 
It was exactly the same now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole . 
Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the effect of the moment : some strove to kiss the hem of his garment , others cried out in sing-song voices . 
He blessed them all and talked with some of them . 
The `` possessed '' woman he knew already . 
She came from a village only six versts from the monastery , and had been brought to him before . 
`` But here is one from afar . '' 
He pointed to a woman by no means old but very thin and wasted , with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened by exposure . 
She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder ; there was something almost frenzied in her eyes . 
`` From afar off , Father , from afar off ! 
From two hundred miles from here . 
From afar off , Father , from afar off ! '' 
the woman began in a sing-song voice as though she were chanting a dirge , swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her hand .
