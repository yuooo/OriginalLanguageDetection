She was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap . 
She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired , without any idea of what she had been asked . 
Kolya showed the powder and the shot . 
The captain , as a military man , undertook to load it , putting in a minute quantity of powder . 
He asked that the shot might be put off till another time . 
The cannon was put on the floor , aiming towards an empty part of the room , three grains of powder were thrust into the touchhole and a match was put to it . 
A magnificent explosion followed . 
Mamma was startled , but at once laughed with delight . 
The boys gazed in speechless triumph . 
But the captain , looking at Ilusha , was more enchanted than any of them . 
Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha , together with the powder and the shot . 
`` I got it for you , for you ! 
I 've been keeping it for you a long time , '' he repeated once more in his delight . 
`` Oh , give it to me ! 
No , give me the cannon ! '' 
mamma began begging like a little child . 
Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it . 
Kolya was disconcerted . 
The captain fidgeted uneasily . 
`` Mamma , mamma , '' he ran to her , `` the cannon 's yours , of course , but let Ilusha have it , because it 's a present to him , but it 's just as good as yours . 
Ilusha will always let you play with it ; it shall belong to both of you , both of you . '' 
`` No , I do n't want it to belong to both of us ; I want it to be mine altogether , not Ilusha 's , '' persisted mamma , on the point of tears . 
`` Take it , mother , here , keep it ! '' 
Ilusha cried . 
`` Krassotkin , may I give it to my mother ? '' 
he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face , as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to someone else . 
`` Of course you may , '' Krassotkin assented heartily , and , taking the cannon from Ilusha , he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow . 
She was so touched that she cried . 
`` Ilusha , darling , he 's the one who loves his mammal '' she said tenderly , and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again . 
`` Mamma , let me kiss your hand . '' 
The captain darted up to her at once and did so . 
`` And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy , '' said the grateful lady , pointing to Krassotkin . 
`` And I 'll bring you as much powder as you like , Ilusha . 
We make the powder ourselves now . 
Borovikov found out how it 's made - twenty-four parts of saltpetre , ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal . 
It 's all pounded together , mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve-that 's how it 's done . '' 
`` Smurov told me about your powder , only father says it 's not real gunpowder , '' responded Ilusha . 
`` Not real ? '' 
Kolya flushed . 
`` It burns . 
I do n't know , of course . '' 
`` No , I did n't mean that , '' put in the captain with a guilty face . 
`` I only said that real powder is not made like that , but that 's nothing , it can be made so . '' 
`` I do n't know , you know best . 
We lighted some in a pomatum pot , it burned splendidly , it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash . 
But that was only the paste , and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best , I do n't know ... And Bulkin 's father thrashed him on account of our powder , did you hear ? '' 
he turned to Ilusha . 
`` We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his bed . 
His father saw it . 
He said it might explode , and thrashed him on the spot .
