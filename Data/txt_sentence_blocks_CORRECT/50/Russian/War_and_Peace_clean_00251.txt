-- But I have to tell you ... '' Natasha put her hand on her mother 's mouth . 
`` About Boris ... I know , '' she said seriously ; `` that 's what I have come about . 
Do n't say it -- I know . 
No , do tell me ! '' 
and she removed her hand . 
`` Tell me , Mamma ! 
He 's nice ? '' 
`` Natasha , you are sixteen . 
At your age I was married . 
You say Boris is nice . 
He is very nice , and I love him like a son . 
But what then ? 
... What are you thinking about ? 
You have quite turned his head , I can see that ... '' As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter . 
Natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead , so that the countess only saw her daughter 's face in profile . 
That face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression . 
Natasha was listening and considering . 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
said she . 
`` You have quite turned his head , and why ? 
What do you want of him ? 
You know you ca n't marry him . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
said Natasha , without changing her position . 
`` Because he is young , because he is poor , because he is a relation ... and because you yourself do n't love him . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` I know . 
It is not right , darling ! '' 
`` But if I want to ... '' said Natasha . 
`` Leave off talking nonsense , '' said the countess . 
`` But if I want to ... '' `` Natasha , I am in earnest ... '' Natasha did not let her finish . 
She drew the countess ' large hand to her , kissed it on the back and then on the palm , then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle , then the space between the knuckles , then the next knuckle , whispering , `` January , February , March , April , May . 
Speak , Mamma , why do n't you say anything ? 
Speak ! '' 
said she , turning to her mother , who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say . 
`` It wo n't do , my love ! 
Not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days , and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us , and above all it torments him for nothing . 
He may already have found a suitable and wealthy match , and now he 's half crazy . '' 
`` Crazy ? '' 
repeated Natasha . 
`` I 'll tell you some things about myself . 
I had a cousin ... '' `` I know ! 
Cyril Matveich ... but he is old . '' 
`` He was not always old . 
But this is what I 'll do , Natasha , I 'll have a talk with Boris . 
He need not come so often ... '' `` Why not , if he likes to ? '' 
`` Because I know it will end in nothing ... '' `` How can you know ? 
No , Mamma , do n't speak to him ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
said Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property .
