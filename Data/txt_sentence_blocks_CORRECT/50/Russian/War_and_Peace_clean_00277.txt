Come on ! 
... I was sure of it , '' began `` Uncle . '' 
-LRB- He was a distant relative of the Rostovs ' , a man of small means , and their neighbor . -RRB- 
`` I knew you would n't be able to resist it and it 's a good thing you 're going . 
That 's it ! 
Come on ! 
-LRB- This was `` Uncle 's '' favorite expression . -RRB- 
`` Take the covert at once , for my Girchik says the Ilagins are at Korniki with their hounds . 
That 's it . 
Come on ! 
... They 'll take the cubs from under your very nose . '' 
`` That 's where I 'm going . 
Shall we join up our packs ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
The hounds were joined into one pack , and `` Uncle '' and Nicholas rode on side by side . 
Natasha , muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes , galloped up to them . 
She was followed by Petya who always kept close to her , by Michael , a huntsman , and by a groom appointed to look after her . 
Petya , who was laughing , whipped and pulled at his horse . 
Natasha sat easily and confidently on her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand . 
`` Uncle '' looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha . 
He did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting . 
`` Good morning , Uncle ! 
We are going too ! '' 
shouted Petya . 
`` Good morning , good morning ! 
But do n't go overriding the hounds , '' said `` Uncle '' sternly . 
`` Nicholas , what a fine dog Trunila is ! 
He knew me , '' said Natasha , referring to her favorite hound . 
`` In the first place , Trunila is not a ` dog , ' but a harrier , '' thought Nicholas , and looked sternly at his sister , trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment . 
Natasha understood it . 
`` You must n't think we 'll be in anyone 's way , Uncle , '' she said . 
`` We 'll go to our places and wo n't budge . '' 
`` A good thing too , little countess , '' said `` Uncle , '' `` only mind you do n't fall off your horse , '' he added , `` because -- that 's it , come on ! 
- you 've nothing to hold on to . '' 
The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off , the huntsmen were already nearing it . 
Rostov , having finally settled with `` Uncle '' where they should set on the hounds , and having shown Natasha where she was to stand -- a spot where nothing could possibly run out -- went round above the ravine . 
`` Well , nephew , you 're going for a big wolf , '' said `` Uncle . '' 
`` Mind and do n't let her slip ! '' 
`` That 's as may happen , '' answered Rostov . 
`` Karay , here ! '' 
he shouted , answering `` Uncle 's '' remark by this call to his borzoi . 
Karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl , famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided . 
They all took up their places . 
The old count , knowing his son 's ardor in the hunt , hurried so as not to be late , and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ilya Rostov , cheerful , flushed , and with quivering cheeks , drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him , where a wolf might come out . 
Having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn , he mounted his good , sleek , well-fed , and comfortable horse , Viflyanka , which was turning gray , like himself . 
His horses and trap were sent home . 
Count Ilya Rostov , though not at heart a keen sportsman , knew the rules of the hunt well , and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand , arranged his reins , settled himself in the saddle , and , feeling that he was ready , looked about with a smile . 
Beside him was Simon Chekmar , his personal attendant , an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle . 
Chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds , who had , however , grown fat like their master and his horse . 
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed .
