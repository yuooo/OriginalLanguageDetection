Nicholas tried to say `` Yes , '' but could not : and he nearly burst into sobs . 
The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son 's condition . 
`` Ah , it ca n't be avoided ! '' 
thought Nicholas , for the first and last time . 
And suddenly , in the most casual tone , which made him feel ashamed feel of himself , he said , as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town : `` Papa , I have come on a matter of business . 
I was nearly forgetting . 
I need some money . '' 
`` Dear me ! '' 
said his father , who was in a specially good humor . 
`` I told you it would not be enough . 
How much ? '' 
`` Very much , '' said Nicholas flushing , and with a stupid careless smile , for which he was long unable to forgive himself , `` I have lost a little , I mean a good deal , a great deal -- forty three thousand . '' 
`` What ! 
To whom ? 
... Nonsense ! '' 
cried the count , suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do . 
`` I promised to pay tomorrow , '' said Nicholas . 
`` Well ! 
... '' said the old count , spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa . 
`` It ca n't be helped It happens to everyone ! '' 
said the son , with a bold , free , and easy tone , while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime . 
He longed to kiss his father 's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness , but said , in a careless and even rude voice , that it happens to everyone ! 
The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son 's words and began bustlingly searching for something . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he muttered , `` it will be difficult , I fear , difficult to raise ... happens to everybody ! 
Yes , who has not done it ? '' 
And with a furtive glance at his son 's face , the count went out of the room ... . 
Nicholas had been prepared for resistance , but had not at all expected this . 
`` Papa ! 
Pa-pa ! '' 
he called after him , sobbing , `` forgive me ! '' 
And seizing his father 's hand , he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears . 
While father and son were having their explanation , the mother and daughter were having one not less important . 
Natasha came running to her mother , quite excited . 
`` Mamma ! 
... Mamma ! 
... He has made me ... '' `` Made what ? '' 
`` Made , made me an offer , Mamma ! 
Mamma ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
The countess did not believe her ears . 
Denisov had proposed . 
To whom ? 
To this chit of a girl , Natasha , who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons . 
`` Do n't , Natasha ! 
What nonsense ! '' 
she said , hoping it was a joke . 
`` Nonsense , indeed ! 
I am telling you the fact , '' said Natasha indignantly . 
`` I come to ask you what to do , and you call it ` nonsense ! ' '' 
The countess shrugged her shoulders .
