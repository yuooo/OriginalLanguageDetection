He wore an unfastened cloak , wide breeches hanging down in creases , and a crumpled shako on the back of his head . 
He came up to the porch gloomily , hanging his head . 
`` Lavwuska ! '' 
he shouted loudly and angrily , `` take it off , blockhead ! '' 
`` Well , I am taking it off , '' replied Lavrushka 's voice . 
`` Ah , you 're up already , '' said Denisov , entering the room . 
`` Long ago , '' answered Rostov , `` I have already been for the hay , and have seen Fraulein Mathilde . '' 
`` Weally ! 
And I 've been losing , bwother . 
I lost yesterday like a damned fool ! '' 
cried Denisov , not pronouncing his r 's . 
`` Such ill luck ! 
Such ill luck . 
As soon as you left , it began and went on . 
Hullo there ! 
Tea ! '' 
Puckering up his face though smiling , and showing his short strong teeth , he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair . 
`` And what devil made me go to that wat ? '' 
-LRB- an officer nicknamed `` the rat '' -RRB- he said , rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands . 
`` Just fancy , he did n't let me win a single cahd , not one cahd . '' 
He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him , gripped it in his fist , and tapped it on the floor , making the sparks fly , while he continued to shout . 
`` He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it ; gives the singles and snatches the doubles ! '' 
He scattered the burning tobacco , smashed the pipe , and threw it away . 
Then he remained silent for a while , and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering , black eyes at Rostov . 
`` If at least we had some women here ; but there 's nothing foh one to do but dwink . 
If we could only get to fighting soon . 
Hullo , who 's there ? '' 
he said , turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop , and a respectful cough . 
`` The squadron quartermaster ! '' 
said Lavrushka . 
Denisov 's face puckered still more . 
`` Wetched ! '' 
he muttered , throwing down a purse with some gold in it . 
`` Wostov , deah fellow , just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow , '' he said , and went out to the quartermaster . 
Rostov took the money and , mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles , began counting them . 
`` Ah ! 
Telyanin ! 
How d'ye do ? 
They plucked me last night , '' came Denisov 's voice from the next room . 
`` Where ? 
At Bykov 's , at the rat 's ... I knew it , '' replied a piping voice , and Lieutenant Telyanin , a small officer of the same squadron , entered the room . 
Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him . 
Telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign . 
He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked ; Rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man . 
`` Well , young cavalryman , how is my Rook behaving ? '' 
he asked . 
-LRB- Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov . -RRB- 
The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face ; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another . 
`` I saw you riding this morning ... '' he added . 
`` Oh , he 's all right , a good horse , '' answered Rostov , though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum .
