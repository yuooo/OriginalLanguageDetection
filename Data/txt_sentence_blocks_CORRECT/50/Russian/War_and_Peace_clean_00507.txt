Was it for this I nursed you ... . 
Ooh ! '' 
`` Do n't , Mary Nikolievna ! '' 
said her husband to her in a low voice , evidently only to justify himself before the stranger . 
`` Sister must have taken her , or else where can she be ? '' 
he added . 
`` Monster ! 
Villain ! '' 
shouted the woman angrily , suddenly ceasing to weep . 
`` You have no heart , you do n't feel for your own child ! 
Another man would have rescued her from the fire . 
But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father ! 
You , honored sir , are a noble man , '' she went on , addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs . 
`` The fire broke out alongside , and blew our way , the maid called out ` Fire ! ' 
and we rushed to collect our things . 
We ran out just as we were ... . 
This is what we have brought away ... . 
The icons , and my dowry bed , all the rest is lost . 
We seized the children . 
But not Katie ! 
Ooh ! 
O Lord ! 
... '' and again she began to sob . 
`` My child , my dear one ! 
Burned , burned ! '' 
`` But where was she left ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her . 
`` Oh , dear sir ! '' 
she cried , seizing him by the legs . 
`` My benefactor , set my heart at ease ... . 
Aniska , go , you horrid girl , show him the way ! '' 
she cried to the maid , angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth . 
`` Show me the way , show me , I. . . 
I 'll do it , '' gasped Pierre rapidly . 
The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk , put up her plait , sighed , and went on her short , bare feet along the path . 
Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon . 
He held his head higher , his eyes shone with the light of life , and with swift steps he followed the maid , overtook her , and came out on the Povarskoy . 
The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke . 
Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud . 
A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration . 
In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him . 
Pierre , accompanied by the maid , was advancing to the spot where the general stood , but the French soldiers stopped him . 
`` On ne passe pas ! '' 
* cried a voice . 
* `` You ca n't pass ! 
`` This way , uncle , '' cried the girl . 
`` We 'll pass through the side street , by the Nikulins ' ! '' 
Pierre turned back , giving a spring now and then to keep up with her . 
She ran across the street , turned down a side street to the left , and , passing three houses , turned into a yard on the right .
