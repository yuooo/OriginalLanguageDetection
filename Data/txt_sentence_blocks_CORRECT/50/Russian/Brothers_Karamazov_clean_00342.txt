Kolya cried triumphantly , proud of his success . 
`` He wo n't move for all the shouting in the world , but if I call to him , he 'll jump up in a minute . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
The dog leapt up and bounded about , whining with delight . 
The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef . 
`` Is it hot ? '' 
Kolya inquired hurriedly , with a business-like air , taking the meat . 
`` Dogs do n't like hot things . 
No , it 's all right . 
Look , everybody , look , Ilusha , look , old man ; why are n't you looking ? 
He does not look at him , now I 've brought him . '' 
The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose . 
The luckless dog had to stand without moving , with the meat on his nose , as long as his master chose to keep him , without a movement , perhaps for half an hour . 
But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment . 
`` Paid for ! '' 
cried Kolya , and the meat passed in a flash from the dog 's nose to his mouth . 
The audience , of course , expressed enthusiasm and surprise . 
`` Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha , with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice . 
`` Simply for that ! '' 
answered Kolya , with perfect simplicity . 
`` I wanted to show him in all his glory . '' 
`` Perezvon ! 
Perezvon , '' called Ilusha suddenly , snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog . 
`` What is it ? 
Let him jump up on the bed ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha . 
The boy threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek . 
Ilusha crept close to him , stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog 's shaggy coat . 
`` Dear , dear ! '' 
kept exclaiming the captain . 
Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed . 
`` Ilusha , I can show you another trick . 
I 've brought you a little cannon . 
You remember , I told you about it before and you said how much you 'd like to see it . 
Well , here , I 've brought it to you . '' 
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon . 
He hurried , because he was happy himself . 
Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off , now he hurried on , regardless of all consideration . 
`` You are all happy now , '' he felt , `` so here 's something to make you happier ! '' 
He was perfectly enchanted himself . 
`` I 've been coveting this thing for a long while ; it 's for you , old man , it 's for you . 
It belonged to Morozov , it was no use to him , he had it from his brother . 
I swopped a book from father 's book-case for it , A Kinsman of Mahomet , or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago , before they had any censorship . 
And Morozov has a taste for such things . 
He was grateful to me , too ... '' Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it . 
Ilusha raised himself , and , with his right arm still round the dog , he gazed enchanted at the toy . 
The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too , and that it could be fired off at once `` if it wo n't alarm the ladies . '' 
`` Mamma '' immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted .
