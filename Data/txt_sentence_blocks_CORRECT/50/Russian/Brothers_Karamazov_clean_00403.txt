Ivan gazed at him , and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror . 
`` He 's mad ! '' 
he cried , and rapidly jumping up , he drew back , so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it , stiff and straight . 
He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov , who , entirely unaffected by his terror , continued fumbling in his stocking , as though he were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull it out . 
At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out . 
Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper , or perhaps a roll of papers . 
Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table . 
`` Here , '' he said quietly . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Ivan , trembling . 
`` Kindly look at it , '' Smerdyakov answered , still in the same low tone . 
Ivan stepped up to the table , took up the roll of paper and began unfolding it , but suddenly drew back his fingers , as though from contact with a loathsome reptile . 
`` Your hands keep twitching , '' observed Smerdyakov , and he deliberately unfolded the bundle himself . 
Under the wrapper were three packets of hundred-rouble notes . 
`` They are all here , all the three thousand roubles ; you need not count them . 
Take them , '' Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan , nodding at the notes . 
Ivan sank back in his chair . 
He was as white as a handkerchief . 
`` You frightened me ... with your stocking , '' he said , with a strange grin . 
`` Can you really not have known till now ? '' 
Smerdyakov asked once more . 
`` No , I did not know . 
I kept thinking of Dmitri . 
Brother , brother ! 
Ach ! '' 
He suddenly clutched his head in both hands . 
`` Listen . 
Did you kill him alone ? 
With my brother 's help or without ? '' 
`` It was only with you , with your help , I killed him , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch is quite innocent . '' 
`` All right , all right . 
Talk about me later . 
Why do I keep on trembling ? 
I ca n't speak properly . '' 
`` You were bold enough then . 
You said ` everything was lawful , ' and how frightened you are now , '' Smerdyakov muttered in surprise . 
`` Wo n't you have some lemonade ? 
I 'll ask for some at once . 
It 's very refreshing . 
Only I must hide this first . '' 
And again he motioned at the notes . 
He was just going to get up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them , but , looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see them , he first took out his handkerchief , and as it turned out to be very dirty , took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table , and put it over the notes . 
The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian . 
Ivan read it mechanically . 
`` I wo n't have any lemonade , '' he said . 
`` Talk of me later . 
Sit down and tell me how you did it . 
Tell me all about it . '' 
`` You 'd better take off your greatcoat , or you 'll be too hot . '' 
Ivan , as though he 'd only just thought of it , took off his coat , and , without getting up from his chair , threw it on the bench .
