A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up . 
`` And how 's it you 're not afraid , sir , really now ? '' 
a red-faced , broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre , with a grin that disclosed a set of sound , white teeth . 
`` Are you afraid , then ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` What else do you expect ? '' 
answered the soldier . 
`` She has no mercy , you know ! 
When she comes spluttering down , out go your innards . 
One ca n't help being afraid , '' he said laughing . 
Several of the men , with bright kindly faces , stopped beside Pierre . 
They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else , and the discovery that he did so delighted them . 
`` It 's the business of us soldiers . 
But in a gentleman it 's wonderful ! 
There 's a gentleman for you ! '' 
`` To your places ! '' 
cried the young officer to the men gathered round Pierre . 
The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality . 
The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field , especially to the left where Bagration 's fleches were , but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything . 
Moreover , his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle -- separated from all else -- formed by the men in the battery . 
His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another , especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield . 
Now , seated on the slope of the trench , he observed the faces of those around him . 
By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery ; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around . 
But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this , and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides . 
`` A live one ! '' 
shouted a man as a whistling shell approached . 
`` Not this way ! 
To the infantry ! '' 
added another with loud laughter , seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports . 
`` Are you bowing to a friend , eh ? '' 
remarked another , chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over . 
Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench , looking out to see what was happening in front . 
`` They 've withdrawn the front line , it has retired , '' said they , pointing over the earthwork . 
`` Mind your own business , '' an old sergeant shouted at them . 
`` If they 've retired it 's because there 's work for them to do farther back . '' 
And the sergeant , taking one of the men by the shoulders , gave him a shove with his knee . 
This was followed by a burst of laughter . 
`` To the fifth gun , wheel it up ! '' 
came shouts from one side . 
`` Now then , all together , like bargees ! '' 
rose the merry voices of those who were moving the gun . 
`` Oh , she nearly knocked our gentleman 's hat off ! '' 
cried the red-faced humorist , showing his teeth chaffing Pierre . 
`` Awkward baggage ! '' 
he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man 's leg . 
`` Now then , you foxes ! '' 
said another , laughing at some militiamen who , stooping low , entered the battery to carry away the wounded man . 
`` So this gruel is n't to your taste ? 
Oh , you crows ! 
You 're scared ! ''
