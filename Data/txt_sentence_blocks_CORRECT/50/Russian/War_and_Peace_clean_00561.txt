And Tikhon , purposely writhing and making faces , pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses . 
The only effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners . 
He was the bravest and most useful man in the party . 
No one found more opportunities for attacking , no one captured or killed more Frenchmen , and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role . 
Now he had been sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a `` tongue . '' 
But whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night , he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and , as Denisov had witnessed from above , had been detected by them . 
After talking for some time with the esaul about next day 's attack , which now , seeing how near they were to the French , he seemed to have definitely decided on , Denisov turned his horse and rode back . 
`` Now , my lad , we 'll go and get dwy , '' he said to Petya . 
As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped , peering into the forest . 
Among the trees a man with long legs and long , swinging arms , wearing a short jacket , bast shoes , and a Kazan hat , was approaching with long , light steps . 
He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle . 
When he espied Denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes , removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim , and approached his commander . 
It was Tikhon . 
His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment . 
He lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh . 
`` Well , where did you disappear to ? '' 
inquired Denisov . 
`` Where did I disappear to ? 
I went to get Frenchmen , '' answered Tikhon boldly and hurriedly , in a husky but melodious bass voice . 
`` Why did you push yourself in there by daylight ? 
You ass ! 
Well , why have n't you taken one ? '' 
`` Oh , I took one all right , '' said Tikhon . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
`` You see , I took him first thing at dawn , '' Tikhon continued , spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes . 
`` I took him into the forest . 
Then I see he 's no good and think I 'll go and fetch a likelier one . '' 
`` You see ? 
... What a wogue -- it 's just as I thought , '' said Denisov to the esaul . 
`` Why did n't you bwing that one ? '' 
`` What was the good of bringing him ? '' 
Tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily -- `` that one would n't have done for you . 
As if I do n't know what sort you want ! '' 
`` What a bwute you are ! 
... Well ? '' 
`` I went for another one , '' Tikhon continued , `` and I crept like this through the wood and lay down . '' 
-LRB- He suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it . -RRB- 
`` One turned up and I grabbed him , like this . '' 
-LRB- He jumped up quickly and lightly . -RRB- '' 
` Come along to the colonel , ' I said . 
He starts yelling , and suddenly there were four of them . 
They rushed at me with their little swords . 
So I went for them with my ax , this way : ` What are you up to ? ' 
says I. ` Christ be with you ! ' '' 
shouted Tikhon , waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest . 
`` Yes , we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles ! '' 
said the esaul , screwing up his glittering eyes . 
Petya badly wanted to laugh , but noticed that they all refrained from laughing . 
He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon 's face to the esaul 's and Denisov 's , unable to make out what it all meant . 
`` Do n't play the fool ! ''
