There was so to speak , a discordant note in the general harmony . 
`` Troy was founded by Teucer , Dardanus , Ilius and Tros , '' the boy rapped out at once , and in the same instant he blushed , blushed so , that it was painful to look at him . 
But the boys stared at him , stared at him for a whole minute , and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya , who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure . 
`` In what sense did they found it ? '' 
he deigned to comment at last . 
`` And what is meant by founding a city or a state ? 
What do they do ? 
Did they go and each lay a brick , do you suppose ? '' 
There was laughter . 
The offending boy turned from pink to crimson . 
He was silent and on the point of tears . 
Kolya held him so for a minute . 
`` Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a nationality , you must first understand what you mean by it , '' he admonished him in stern , incisive tones . 
`` But I attach no consequence to these old wives ' tales and I do n't think much of universal history in general , '' he added carelessly , addressing the company generally . 
`` Universal history ? '' 
the captain inquired , looking almost scared . 
`` Yes , universal history ! 
It 's the study of the successive follies of mankind and nothing more . 
The only subjects I respect are mathematics and natural science , '' said Kolya . 
He was showing off and he stole a glance at Alyosha ; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there . 
But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before . 
If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him , but Alyosha was silent and `` it might be the silence of contempt , '' and that finally irritated Kolya . 
`` The classical languages , too ... they are simply madness , nothing more . 
You seem to disagree with me again , Karamazov ? '' 
`` I do n't agree , '' said Alyosha , with a faint smile . 
`` The study of the classics , if you ask my opinion , is simply a police measure , that 's simply why it has been introduced into our schools . '' 
By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again . 
`` Latin and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect . 
It was dull before , so what could they do to make things duller ? 
It was senseless enough before , so what could they do to make it more senseless ? 
So they thought of Greek and Latin . 
That 's my opinion , I hope I shall never change it , '' Kolya finished abruptly . 
His cheeks were flushed . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Smurov suddenly , in a ringing tone of conviction . 
He had listened attentively . 
`` And yet he is first in Latin himself , '' cried one of the group of boys suddenly . 
`` Yes , father , he says that and yet he is first in Latin , '' echoed Ilusha . 
`` What of it ? '' 
Kolya thought fit to defend himself , though the praise was very sweet to him . 
`` I am fagging away at Latin because I have to , because I promised my mother to pass my examination , and I think that whatever you do , it 's worth doing it well . 
But in my soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud ... . 
You do n't agree , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Why ` fraud ' ? '' 
Alyosha smiled again . 
`` Well , all the classical authors have been translated into all languages , so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin , but solely as a police measure , to stupefy the intelligence . 
So what can one call it but a fraud ? '' 
`` Why , who taught you all this ? '' 
cried Alyosha , surprised at last . 
`` In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being taught . 
Besides , what I said just now about the classics being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class . ''
