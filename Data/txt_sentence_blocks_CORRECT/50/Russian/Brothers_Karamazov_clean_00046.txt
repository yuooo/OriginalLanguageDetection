For one moment everyone stared at him without a word ; and at once everyone felt that something revolting , grotesque , positively scandalous , was about to happen . 
Miusov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage . 
All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly . 
`` No ! 
this I can not endure ! '' 
he cried . 
`` I absolutely can not ! 
and ... I certainly can not ! '' 
The blood rushed to his head . 
He positively stammered ; but he was beyond thinking of style , and he seized his hat . 
`` What is it he can not ? '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , `` that he absolutely can not and certainly can not ? 
Your reverence , am I to come in or not ? 
Will you receive me as your guest ? '' 
`` You are welcome with all my heart , '' answered the Superior . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
he added , `` I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your dissensions , and to be united in love and family harmony - with prayer to the Lord at our humble table . '' 
`` No , no , it is impossible ! '' 
cried Miusov , beside himself . 
`` Well , if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch , it is impossible for me , and I wo n't stop . 
That is why I came . 
I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now . 
If you will go away , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , I will go away too , if you remain , I will remain . 
You stung him by what you said about family harmony , Father Superior , he does not admit he is my relation . 
That 's right , is n't it , von Sohn ? 
Here 's von Sohn . 
How are you , von Sohn ? '' 
`` Do you mean me ? '' 
muttered Maximov , puzzled . 
`` Of course I mean you , '' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
`` Who else ? 
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn . '' 
`` But I am not von Sohn either . 
I am Maximov . '' 
`` No , you are von Sohn . 
Your reverence , do you know who von Sohn was ? 
It was a famous murder case . 
He was killed in a house of harlotry - I believe that is what such places are called among you - he was killed and robbed , and in spite of his venerable age , he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van , and while they were nailing him up , the harlots sang songs and played the harp , that is to say , the piano . 
So this is that very von Solin . 
He has risen from the dead , has n't he , von Sohn ? '' 
`` What is happening ? 
What 's this ? '' 
voices were heard in the group of monks . 
`` Let us go , '' cried Miusov , addressing Kalganov . 
`` No , excuse me , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly , taking another step into the room . 
`` Allow me to finish . 
There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon , Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
Miusov , my relation , prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his words , but I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse , and - damn the noblesse ! 
That 's right , is n't it , von Sohn ? 
Allow me , Father Superior , though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon , yet I am the soul of honour , and I want to speak my mind .
