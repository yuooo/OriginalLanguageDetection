`` You used to say yourself that everything was lawful , so now why are you so upset , too ? 
You even want to go and give evidence against yourself ... . 
Only there 'll be nothing of the sort ! 
You wo n't go to give evidence , '' Smerdyakov decided with conviction . 
`` You 'll see , '' said Ivan . 
`` It is n't possible . 
You are very clever . 
You are fond of money , I know that . 
You like to be respected , too , for you 're very proud ; you are far too fond of female charms , too , and you mind most of all about living in undisturbed comfort , without having to depend on anyone - that 's what you care most about . 
You wo n't want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself . 
You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch , you are more like him than any of his children ; you 've the same soul as he had . '' 
`` You are not a fool , '' said Ivan , seeming struck . 
The blood rushed to his face . 
`` You are serious now ! '' 
he observed , looking suddenly at Smerdyakov with a different expression . 
`` It was your pride made you think I was a fool . 
Take the money . '' 
Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without wrapping them in anything . 
`` I shall show them at the court to-morrow , '' he said . 
`` Nobody will believe you , as you 've plenty of money of your own ; you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court . '' 
Ivan rose from his seat . 
`` I repeat , '' he said , `` the only reason I have n't killed you is that I need you for to-morrow , remember that , do n't forget it ! '' 
`` Well , kill me . 
Kill me now , '' Smerdyakov said , all at once looking strangely at Ivan . 
`` You wo n't dare do that even ! '' 
he added , with a bitter smile . 
`` You wo n't dare to do anything , you , who used to be so bold ! '' 
`` Till to-morrow , '' cried Ivan , and moved to go out . 
`` Stay a moment ... . 
Show me those notes again . '' 
Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him . 
Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds . 
`` Well , you can go , '' he said , with a wave of his hand . 
`` Ivan Fyodorovitch ! '' 
he called after him again . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
Ivan turned without stopping . 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` Till to-morrow ! '' 
Ivan cried again , and he walked out of the cottage . 
The snowstorm was still raging . 
He walked the first few steps boldly , but suddenly began staggering . 
`` It 's something physical , '' he thought with a grin . 
Something like joy was springing up in his heart . 
He was conscious of unbounded resolution ; he would make an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late . 
His determination was taken , `` and now it will not be changed , '' he thought with relief . 
At that moment he stumbled against something and almost fell down . 
Stopping short , he made out at his feet the peasant he had knocked down , still lying senseless and motionless . 
The snow had almost covered his face . 
Ivan seized him and lifted him in his arms .
