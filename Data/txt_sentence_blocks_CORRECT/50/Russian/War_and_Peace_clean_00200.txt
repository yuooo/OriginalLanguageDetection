On the contrary , I am very glad to make your acquaintance , '' said Pierre . 
And again , glancing at the stranger 's hands , he looked more closely at the ring , with its skull -- a Masonic sign . 
`` Allow me to ask , '' he said , `` are you a Mason ? '' 
`` Yes , I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons , '' said the stranger , looking deeper and deeper into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` And in their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you . '' 
`` I am afraid , '' said Pierre , smiling , and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs -- `` I am afraid I am very far from understanding -- how am I to put it ? 
-- I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another . '' 
`` I know your outlook , '' said the Mason , `` and the view of life you mention , and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts , is the one held by the majority of people , and is the invariable fruit of pride , indolence , and ignorance . 
Forgive me , my dear sir , but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you . 
Your view of life is a regrettable delusion . '' 
`` Just as I may suppose you to be deluded , '' said Pierre , with a faint smile . 
`` I should never dare to say that I know the truth , '' said the Mason , whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness . 
`` No one can attain to truth by himself . 
Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all , by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times , is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God , '' he added , and closed his eyes . 
`` I ought to tell you that I do not believe ... do not believe in God , '' said Pierre , regretfully and with an effort , feeling it essential to speak the whole truth . 
The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he , poor man , had not the five rubles that would make him happy . 
`` Yes , you do not know Him , my dear sir , '' said the Mason . 
`` You can not know Him . 
You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I am unhappy , '' assented Pierre . 
`` But what am I to do ? '' 
`` You know Him not , my dear sir , and so you are very unhappy . 
You do not know Him , but He is here , He is in me , He is in my words , He is in thee , and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered ! '' 
pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice . 
He paused and sighed , evidently trying to calm himself . 
`` If He were not , '' he said quietly , `` you and I would not be speaking of Him , my dear sir . 
Of what , of whom , are we speaking ? 
Whom hast thou denied ? '' 
he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice . 
`` Who invented Him , if He did not exist ? 
Whence came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being ? 
didst thou , and why did the whole world , conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being , a Being all-powerful , eternal , and infinite in all His attributes ? 
... '' He stopped and remained silent for a long time . 
Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence . 
`` He exists , but to understand Him is hard , '' the Mason began again , looking not at Pierre but straight before him , and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still . 
`` If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee , could take him by the hand and show him to thee . 
But how can I , an insignificant mortal , show His omnipotence , His infinity , and all His mercy to one who is blind , or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness ? '' 
He paused again . 
`` Who art thou ? 
Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words , '' he went on , with a somber and scornful smile . 
`` And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child , who , playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch , dares to say that , as he does not understand its use , he does not believe in the master who made it . 
To know Him is hard ... . 
For ages , from our forefather Adam to our own day , we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim ; but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness ... '' Pierre listened with swelling heart , gazing into the Mason 's face with shining eyes , not interrupting or questioning him , but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said . 
Whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason 's words , or believed as a child believes , in the speaker 's tone of conviction and earnestness , or the tremor of the speaker 's voice -- which sometimes almost broke -- or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction , or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation , which radiated from his whole being -LRB- and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness -RRB- -- at any rate , Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe , and felt a joyful sense of comfort , regeneration , and return to life . 
`` He is not to be apprehended by reason , but by life , '' said the Mason . 
`` I do not understand , '' said Pierre , feeling with dismay doubts reawakening . 
He was afraid of any want of clearness , any weakness , in the Mason 's arguments ; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him . 
`` I do n't understand , '' he said , `` how it is that the mind of man can not attain the knowledge of which you speak . '' 
The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile . 
`` The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to imbibe , '' he said .
