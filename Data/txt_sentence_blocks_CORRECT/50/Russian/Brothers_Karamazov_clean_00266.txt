There was a sort of boldness , a sudden confidence shining in his eyes . 
His face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before . 
He led the Poles , not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid , but into the bedroom on the right , where the trunks and packages were kept , and there were two large beds , with pyramids of cotton pillows on each . 
There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner . 
The small man and Mitya sat down to this table , facing each other , while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them , his hands behind his back . 
The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive . 
`` What can I do for you , panie ? '' 
lisped the little Pole . 
`` Well , look here , panie , I wo n't keep you long . 
There 's money for you , '' he pulled out his notes . 
`` Would you like three thousand ? 
Take it and go your way . '' 
The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya , with a searching look . 
`` Three thousand , panie ? '' 
He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky . 
`` Three , panovie , three ! 
Listen , panie , I see you 're a sensible man . 
Take three thousand and go to the devil , and Vrublevsky with you d'you hear ? 
But , at once , this very minute , and for ever . 
You understand that , panie , for ever . 
Here 's the door , you go out of it . 
What have you got there , a great-coat , a fur coat ? 
I 'll bring it out to you . 
They 'll get the horses out directly , and then-good-bye , panie ! '' 
Mitya awaited an answer with assurance . 
He had no doubts . 
An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole 's face . 
`` And the money , panie ? '' 
`` The money , panie ? 
Five hundred roubles I 'll give you this moment for the journey , and as a first instalment , and two thousand five hundred to-morrow , in the town - I swear on my honour , I 'll get it , I 'll get it at any cost ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
The Poles exchanged glances again . 
The short man 's face looked more forbidding . 
`` Seven hundred , seven hundred , not five hundred , at once , this minute , cash down ! '' 
Mitya added , feeling something wrong . 
`` What 's the matter , panie ? 
Do n't you trust me ? 
I ca n't give you the whole three thousand straight off . 
If I give it , you may come back to her to-morrow ... . 
Besides , I have n't the three thousand with me . 
I 've got it at home in the town , '' faltered Mitya , his spirit sinking at every word he uttered . 
`` Upon my word , the money 's there , hidden . '' 
In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man 's face . 
`` What next ? '' 
he asked ironically . 
`` For shame ! '' 
and he spat on the floor . 
Pan Vrublevsky spat too . 
`` You do that , panie , '' said Mitya , recognising with despair that all was over , `` because you hope to make more out of Grushenka ? 
You 're a couple of capons , that 's what you are ! ''
