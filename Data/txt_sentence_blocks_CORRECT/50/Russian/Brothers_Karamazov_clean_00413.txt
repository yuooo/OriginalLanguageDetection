Ivan snapped out . 
`` But you are clever , anyway . 
You are scolding again ? 
I did n't ask out of sympathy . 
You need n't answer . 
Now rheumatism has come in again - '' `` Fool ! '' 
repeated Ivan . 
`` You keep saying the same thing ; but I had such an attack of rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day . '' 
`` The devil have rheumatism ! '' 
`` Why not , if I sometimes put on fleshly form ? 
I put on fleshly form and I take the consequences . 
Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto . '' 
* * I am Satan , and deem nothing human alien to me . 
`` What , what , Satan sum et nihil humanum ... that 's not bad for the devil ! '' 
`` I am glad I 've pleased you at last . '' 
`` But you did n't get that from me . '' 
Ivan stopped suddenly , seeming struck . 
`` That never entered my head , that 's strange . '' 
`` C'est du nouveau , n'est - ce pas ? '' 
* This time I 'll act honestly and explain to you . 
Listen , in dreams and especially in nightmares , from indigestion or anything , a man sees sometimes such artistic visions , such complex and real actuality , such events , even a whole world of events , woven into such a plot , with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff , as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented . 
Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers , but by the most ordinary people , officials , journalists , priests ... . 
The subject is a complete enigma . 
A statesman confessed to me , indeed , that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep . 
Well , that 's how it is now , though I am your hallucination , yet just as in a nightmare , I say original things which had not entered your head before . 
So I do n't repeat your ideas , yet I am only your nightmare , nothing more . '' 
* It 's new , is n't it ? 
`` You are lying , your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my nightmare , and now you are asserting you are a dream . '' 
`` My dear fellow , I 've adopted a special method to-day , I 'll explain it to you afterwards . 
Stay , where did I break off ? 
Oh , yes ! 
I caught cold then , only not here but yonder . '' 
`` Where is yonder ? 
Tell me , will you be here long . 
Ca n't you go away ? '' 
Ivan exclaimed almost in despair . 
He ceased walking to and fro , sat down on the sofa , leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in both hands . 
He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation . 
It was evidently of no use . 
`` Your nerves are out of order , '' observed the gentleman , with a carelessly easy , though perfectly polite , air . 
`` You are angry with me even for being able to catch cold , though it happened in a most natural way . 
I was hurrying then to a diplomatic soiree at the house of a lady of high rank in Petersburg , who was aiming at influence in the Ministry . 
Well , an evening suit , white tie , gloves , though I was God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth ... . 
Of course , it took only an instant , but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight minutes , and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat . 
Spirits do n't freeze , but when one 's in fleshly form , well ... in brief , I did n't think , and set off , and you know in those ethereal spaces , in the water that is above the firmament , there 's such a frost ... at least one ca n't call it frost , you fancy , 150 degrees below zero ! 
You know the game the village girls play - they invite the unwary to lick an axe in thirty degrees of frost , the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off , so it bleeds . 
But that 's only in 30 degrees , in 150 degrees I imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the axe and it would be the end of it ... if only there could be an axe there . '' 
`` And can there be an axe there ? '' 
Ivan interrupted , carelessly and disdainfully . 
He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity `` An axe ? ''
