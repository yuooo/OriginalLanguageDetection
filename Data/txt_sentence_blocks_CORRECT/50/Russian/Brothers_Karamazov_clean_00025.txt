What for ? '' 
Alyosha muttered in great astonishment . 
His face at once looked anxious . 
`` Oh , it 's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and - what has happened lately , '' the mother explained hurriedly . 
`` Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind , but she must see you about it ... . 
Why , of course , I ca n't say . 
But she wants to see you at once . 
And you will go to her , of course . 
It is a Christian duty . '' 
`` I have only seen her once , '' Alyosha protested with the same perplexity . 
`` Oh , she is such a lofty , incomparable creature If only for her suffering ... . 
Think what she has gone through , what she is enduring now Think what awaits her ! 
It 's all terrible , terrible ! 
`` Very well , I will come , '' Alyosha decided , after rapidly scanning the brief , enigmatic note , which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would come , without any sort of explanation . 
`` Oh , how sweet and generous that would be of you '' cried Lise with sudden animation . 
`` I told mamma you 'd be sure not to go . 
I said you were saving your soul . 
How splendid you are I 've always thought you were splendid . 
How glad I am to tell you so ! '' 
`` Lise ! '' 
said her mother impressively , though she smiled after she had said it . 
`` You have quite forgotten us , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said ; `` you never come to see us . 
Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except with you . '' 
Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed , and again smiled without knowing why . 
But the elder was no longer watching him . 
He had begun talking to a monk who , as mentioned before , had been awaiting his entrance by Lise 's chair . 
He was evidently a monk of the humblest , that is of the peasant , class , of a narrow outlook , but a true believer , and , in his own way , a stubborn one . 
He announced that he had come from the far north , from Obdorsk , from Saint Sylvester , and was a member of a poor monastery , consisting of only ten monks . 
The elder gave him his blessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked . 
`` How can you presume to do such deeds ? '' 
the monk asked suddenly , pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise . 
He was referring to her `` healing . '' 
`` It 's too early , of course , to speak of that . 
Relief is not complete cure , and may proceed from different causes . 
But if there has been any healing , it is by no power but God 's will . 
It 's all from God . 
Visit me , Father , '' he added to the monk . 
`` It 's not often I can see visitors . 
I am ill , and I know that my days are numbered . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
God will not take you from us . 
You will live a long , long time yet , '' cried the lady . 
`` And in what way are you ill ? 
You look so well , so gay and happy . '' 
`` I am extraordinarily better to-day . 
But I know that it 's only for a moment . 
I understand my disease now thoroughly . 
If I seem so happy to you , you could never say anything that would please me so much . 
For men are made for happiness , and anyone who is completely happy has a right to say to himself , ' I am doing God 's will on earth . ' 
All the righteous , all the saints , all the holy martyrs were happy . ''
