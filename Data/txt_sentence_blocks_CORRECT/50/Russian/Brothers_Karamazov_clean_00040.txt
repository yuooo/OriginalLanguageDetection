Like your elder , he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a murderer . '' 
`` What crime ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
Alyosha stopped dead . 
Rakitin stopped , too . 
`` What murderer ? 
As though you did n't know ! 
I 'll bet you 've thought of it before . 
That 's interesting , too , by the way . 
Listen , Alyosha , you always speak the truth , though you 're always between two stools . 
Have you thought of it or not ? 
Answer . '' 
`` I have , '' answered Alyosha in a low voice . 
Even Rakitin was taken aback . 
`` What ? 
Have you really ? '' 
he cried . 
`` I. . . 
I 've not exactly thought it , '' muttered Alyosha , `` but directly you began speaking so strangely , I fancied I had thought of it myself . '' 
`` You see ? 
-LRB- And how well you expressed it ! -RRB- 
Looking at your father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime . 
Then I 'm not mistaken ? '' 
`` But wait , wait a minute , '' Alyosha broke in uneasily , `` What has led you to see all this ? 
Why does it interest you ? 
That 's the first question . '' 
`` Two questions , disconnected , but natural . 
I 'll deal with them separately . 
What led me to see it ? 
I should n't have seen it , if I had n't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri , seen right into the very heart of him all at once . 
I caught the whole man from one trait . 
These very honest but passionate people have a line which must n't be crossed . 
If it were , he 'd run at your father with a knife . 
But your father 's a drunken and abandoned old sinner , who can never draw the line - if they both themselves go , they 'll both come to grief . '' 
`` No , Misha , no . 
If that 's all , you 've reassured me . 
It wo n't come to that . '' 
`` But why are you trembling ? 
Let me tell you ; he may be honest , our Mitya -LRB- he is stupid , but honest -RRB- , but he 's - a sensualist . 
That 's the very definition and inner essence of him . 
It 's your father has handed him on his low sensuality . 
Do you know , I simply wonder at you , Alyosha , how you can have kept your purity . 
You 're a Karamazov too , you know ! 
In your family sensuality is carried to a disease . 
But now , these three sensualists are watching one another , with their knives in their belts . 
The three of them are knocking their heads together , and you may be the fourth . '' 
`` You are mistaken about that woman . 
Dmitri despises her , '' said Alyosha , with a sort of shudder . 
`` Grushenka ? 
No , brother , he does n't despise her .
