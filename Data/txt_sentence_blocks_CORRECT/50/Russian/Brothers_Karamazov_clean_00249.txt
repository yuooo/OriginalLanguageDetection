She ran up panting , clasped her hands before him with a cry , and plumped down at his feet . 
`` Dmitri Fyodorovitch , dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch , do n't harm my mistress . 
And it was I told you all about it ... . 
And do n't murder him , he came first , he 's hers ! 
He 'll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now . 
That 's why he 's come back from Siberia . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch , dear , do n't take a fellow creature 's life ! '' 
`` Tut-tut-tut ! 
That 's it , is it ? 
So you 're off there to make trouble ! '' 
muttered Pyotr Ilyitch . 
`` Now , it 's all clear , as clear as daylight . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch , give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a man , '' he shouted aloud to Mitya . 
`` Do you hear , Dmitri ? '' 
`` The pistols ? 
Wait a bit , brother , I 'll throw them into the pool on the road , '' answered Mitya . 
`` Fenya , get up , do n't kneel to me . 
Mitya wo n't hurt anyone , the silly fool wo n't hurt anyone again . 
But I say , Fenya , '' he shouted , after having taken his seat . 
`` I hurt you just now , so forgive me and have pity on me , forgive a scoundrel ... . 
But it does n't matter if you do n't . 
It 's all the same now . 
Now then , Andrey , look alive , fly along full speed ! '' 
Andrey whipped up the horses , and the bells began ringing . 
`` Good-bye , Pyotr Ilyitch ! 
My last tear is for you ! 
... '' `` He 's not drunk , but he keeps babbling like a lunatic , '' Pyotr Ilyitch thought as he watched him go . 
He had half a mind to stay and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions , knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya . 
But , suddenly feeling vexed with himself , he turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards . 
`` He 's a fool , though he 's a good fellow , '' he muttered as he went . 
`` I 've heard of that officer , Grushenka 's former flame . 
Well , if he has turned up ... . 
Ech , those pistols ! 
Damn it all ! 
I 'm not his nurse ! 
Let them do what they like ! 
Besides , it 'll all come to nothing . 
They 're a set of brawlers , that 's all . 
They 'll drink and fight , fight and make friends again . 
They are not men who do anything real . 
What does he mean by ` I 'm stepping aside , I 'm punishing myself ' ? 
It 'll come to nothing ! 
He 's shouted such phrases a thousand times , drunk , in the taverns . 
But now he 's not drunk . 
` Drunk in spirit ' - they 're fond of fine phrases , the villains . 
Am I his nurse ? 
He must have been fighting , his face was all over blood . 
With whom ? 
I shall find out at the Metropolis . 
And his handkerchief was soaked in blood ... .
