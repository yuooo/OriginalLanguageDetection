But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly , but made them , on the contrary , run farther away . 
Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats , with closely shaven heads . 
Two officers , one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean , dark-gray horse , the other in an overcoat and on foot , stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street , talking . 
A third officer galloped up to them . 
`` The general orders them all to be driven out at once , without fail . 
This is outrageous ! 
Half the men have dispersed . '' 
`` Where are you off to ? 
... Where ? 
... '' he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who , holding up the skirts of their overcoats , were slipping past him into the Bazaar passage . 
`` Stop , you rascals ! '' 
`` But how are you going to stop them ? '' 
replied another officer . 
`` There is no getting them together . 
The army should push on before the rest bolt , that 's all ! '' 
`` How can one push on ? 
They are stuck there , wedged on the bridge , and do n't move . 
Should n't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away ? '' 
`` Come , go in there and drive them out ! '' 
shouted the senior officer . 
The officer in the scarf dismounted , called up a drummer , and went with him into the arcade . 
Some soldiers started running away in a group . 
A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose , and a calm , persistent , calculating expression on his plump face , hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer , swinging his arms . 
`` Your honor ! '' 
said he . 
`` Be so good as to protect us ! 
We wo n't grudge trifles , you are welcome to anything -- we shall be delighted ! 
Pray ! 
... I 'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman , or even two pieces with pleasure . 
For we feel how it is ; but what 's all this -- sheer robbery ! 
If you please , could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop ... '' Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer . 
`` Eh , what twaddle ! '' 
said one of them , a thin , stern-looking man . 
`` When one 's head is gone one does n't weep for one 's hair ! 
Take what any of you like ! '' 
And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer . 
`` It 's all very well for you , Ivan Sidorych , to talk , '' said the first tradesman angrily . 
`` Please step inside , your honor ! '' 
`` Talk indeed ! '' 
cried the thin one . 
`` In my three shops here I have a hundred thousand rubles ' worth of goods . 
Can they be saved when the army has gone ? 
Eh , what people ! 
` Against God 's might our hands ca n't fight . ' '' 
`` Come inside , your honor ! '' 
repeated the tradesman , bowing . 
The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision . 
`` It 's not my business ! '' 
he exclaimed , and strode on quickly down one of the passages . 
From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation , and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently .
