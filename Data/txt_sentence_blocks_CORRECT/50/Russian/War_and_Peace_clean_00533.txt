`` How are you now ? '' 
said Princess Mary , herself surprised at what she was saying . 
`` That , my dear , you must ask the doctor , '' he replied , and again making an evident effort to be affectionate , he said with his lips only -LRB- his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts -RRB- : `` Merci , chere amie , d'etre venue . '' 
* * `` Thank you for coming , my dear . '' 
Princess Mary pressed his hand . 
The pressure made him wince just perceptibly . 
He was silent , and she did not know what to say . 
She now understood what had happened to him two days before . 
In his words , his tone , and especially in that calm , almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world , terrible in one who is alive . 
Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living ; but it was obvious that he failed to understand , not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else -- something the living did not and could not understand -- and which wholly occupied his mind . 
`` There , you see how strangely fate has brought us together , '' said he , breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha . 
`` She looks after me all the time . '' 
Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing . 
He , the sensitive , tender Prince Andrew , how could he say that , before her whom he loved and who loved him ? 
Had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone . 
If he had not known that he was dying , how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence ? 
The only explanation was that he was indifferent , because something else , much more important , had been revealed to him . 
The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off . 
`` Mary came by way of Ryazan , '' said Natasha . 
Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary , and only after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it herself . 
`` Really ? '' 
he asked . 
`` They told her that all Moscow has been burned down , and that ... '' Natasha stopped . 
It was impossible to talk . 
It was plain that he was making an effort to listen , but could not do so . 
`` Yes , they say it 's burned , '' he said . 
`` It 's a great pity , '' and he gazed straight before him , absently stroking his mustache with his fingers . 
`` And so you have met Count Nicholas , Mary ? '' 
Prince Andrew suddenly said , evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them . 
`` He wrote here that he took a great liking to you , '' he went on simply and calmly , evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people . 
`` If you liked him too , it would be a good thing for you to get married , '' he added rather more quickly , as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking . 
Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her , except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living . 
`` Why talk of me ? '' 
she said quietly and glanced at Natasha . 
Natasha , who felt her glance , did not look at her . 
All three were again silent . 
`` Andrew , would you like ... '' Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling voice , `` would you like to see little Nicholas ? 
He is always talking about you ! '' 
Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time , but Princess Mary , who knew his face so well , saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son , but with quiet , gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him . 
`` Yes , I shall be very glad to see him . 
Is he quite well ? '' 
When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew 's room he looked at his father with frightened eyes , but did not cry , because no one else was crying . 
Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him . 
When Nicholas had been led away , Princess Mary again went up to her brother , kissed him , and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry . 
He looked at her attentively . 
`` Is it about Nicholas ? '' 
he asked . 
Princess Mary nodded her head , weeping . 
`` Mary , you know the Gosp ... '' but he broke off . 
`` What did you say ? ''
