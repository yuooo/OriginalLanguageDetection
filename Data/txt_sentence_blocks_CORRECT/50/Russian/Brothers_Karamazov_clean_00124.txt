Allow me to introduce my family , my two daughters and my son - my litter . 
If I die , who will care for them , and while I live who but they will care for a wretch like me ? 
That 's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort , sir . 
For there must be someone able to love even a man like me . '' 
`` Ah , that 's perfectly true ! '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` Oh , do leave off playing the fool ! 
Some idiot comes in , and you put us to shame ! '' 
cried the girl by the window , suddenly turning to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air . 
`` Wait a little , Varvara ! '' 
cried her father , speaking peremptorily but looking at them quite approvingly . 
`` That 's her character , '' he said , addressing Alyosha again . 
`` And in all nature there was naught That could find favour in his eyes - or rather in the feminine - that could find favour in her eyes - . 
But now let me present you to my wife , Arina Petrovna . 
She is crippled , she is forty-three ; she can move , but very little . 
She is of humble origin . 
Arina Petrovna , compose your countenance . 
This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
Get up , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
He took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him up . 
`` You must stand up to be introduced to a lady . 
It 's not the Karamazov , mamma , who ... h 'm ... etcetera , but his brother , radiant with modest virtues . 
Come , Arina Petrovna , come , mamma , first your hand to be kissed . '' 
And he kissed his wife 's hand respectfully and even tenderly . 
The girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene ; an expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the woman . 
`` Good morning ! 
Sit down , Mr. Tchernomazov , '' she said . 
`` Karamazov , mamma , Karamazov . 
We are of humble origin , '' he whispered again . 
`` Well , Karamazov , or whatever it is , but I always think of Tchermomazov ... . 
Sit down . 
Why has he pulled you up ? 
He calls me crippled , but I am not , only my legs are swollen like barrels , and I am shrivelled up myself . 
Once I used to be so fat , but now it 's as though I had swallowed a needle . '' 
`` We are of humble origin , '' the captain muttered again . 
`` Oh , father , father ! '' 
the hunchback girl , who had till then been silent on her chair , said suddenly , and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief . 
`` Buffoon ! '' 
blurted out the girl at the window . 
`` Have you heard our news ? '' 
said the mother , pointing at her daughters . 
`` It 's like clouds coming over ; the clouds pass and we have music again . 
When we were with the army , we used to have many such guests . 
I do n't mean to make any comparisons ; everyone to their taste . 
The deacon 's wife used to come then and say , ` Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart , but Nastasya Petrovna , ' she would say , ` is of the brood of hell . ' 
` Well , ' I said , ` that 's a matter of taste ; but you are a little spitfire . ' 
` And you want keeping in your place ; ' says she . 
` You black sword , ' said I , ` who asked you to teach me ? ' 
` But my breath , ' says she , ` is clean , and yours is unclean . ' 
` You ask all the officers whether my breath is unclean . '
