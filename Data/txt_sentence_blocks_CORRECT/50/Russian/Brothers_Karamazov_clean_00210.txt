Be quiet , Rakitin , do n't remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch , he has bruised my heart . 
And I do n't want to think of that at this moment . 
I can think of Alyosha here , I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me , dear , cheer up , smile at my foolishness , at my pleasure ... . 
Ah , he 's smiling , he 's smiling ! 
How kindly he looks at me ! 
And you know , Alyosha , I 've been thinking all this time you were angry with me , because of the day before yesterday , because of that young lady . 
I was a cur , that 's the truth ... . 
But it 's a good thing it happened so . 
It was a horrid thing , but a good thing too . '' 
Grushenka smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile . 
`` Mitya told me that she screamed out that I ` ought to be flogged . ' 
I did insult her dreadfully . 
She sent for me , she wanted to make a conquest of me , to win me over with her chocolate ... . 
No , it 's a good thing it did end like that . '' 
She smiled again . 
`` But I am still afraid of your being angry . '' 
`` Yes , that 's really true , '' Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise . 
`` Alyosha , she is really afraid of a chicken like you . '' 
`` He is a chicken to you , Rakitin ... because you 've no conscience , that 's what it is ! 
You see , I love him with all my soul , that 's how it is ! 
Alyosha , do you believe I love you with all my soul ? '' 
`` Ah , you shameless woman ! 
She is making you a declaration , Alexey ! '' 
`` Well , what of it , I love him ! '' 
`` And what about your officer ? 
And the priceless message from Mokroe ? '' 
`` That is quite different . '' 
`` That 's a woman 's way of looking at it ! '' 
`` Do n't you make me angry , Rakitin . '' 
Grushenka caught him up hotly . 
`` This is quite different . 
I love Alyosha in a different way . 
It 's true , Alyosha , I had sly designs on you before . 
For I am a horrid , violent creature . 
But at other times I 've looked upon you , Alyosha , as my conscience . 
I 've kept thinking ` how anyone like that must despise a nasty thing like me . ' 
I thought that the day before yesterday , as I ran home from the young lady 's . 
I have thought of you a long time in that way , Alyosha , and Mitya knows ; I 've talked to him about it . 
Mitya understands . 
Would you believe it , I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed , utterly ashamed of myself ... . 
And how , and since when , I began to think about you like that , I ca n't say , I do n't remember ... '' Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of champagne on the table . 
`` Here 's the champagne ! '' 
cried Rakitin . 
`` You 're excited , Agrafena Alexandrovna , and not yourself . 
When you 've had a glass of champagne , you 'll be ready to dance . 
Eh , they ca n't even do that properly , '' he added , looking at the bottle . 
`` The old woman 's poured it out in the kitchen and the bottle 's been brought in warm and without a cork . 
Well , let me have some , anyway . '' 
He went up to the table , took a glass , emptied it at one gulp and poured himself out another . 
`` One does n't often stumble upon champagne , '' he said , licking his lips .
