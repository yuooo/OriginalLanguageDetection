It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life , but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him . 
His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew 's life . 
Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way , inwardly he began a new life . 
It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills . 
As they approached the house , Prince Andrew with asmile drew Pierre 's attention to a commotion going on at the back porch . 
A woman , bent with age , with a wallet on her back , and a short , long-haired , young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up . 
Two women ran out after them , and all four , looking round at the carriage , ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch . 
`` Those are Mary 's ` God 's folk , ' '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` They have mistaken us for my father . 
This is the one matter in which she disobeys him . 
He orders these pilgrims to be driven away , but she receives them . '' 
`` But what are ` God 's folk ' ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
Prince Andrew had no time to answer . 
The servants came out to meet them , and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon . 
The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute . 
Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments , which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father 's house ; he himself went to the nursery . 
`` Let us go and see my sister , '' he said to Pierre when he returned . 
`` I have not found her yet , she is hiding now , sitting with her ` God 's folk . ' 
It will serve her right , she will be confused , but you will see her ` God 's folk . ' 
It 's really very curious . '' 
`` What are ` God 's folk ' ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` Come , and you 'll see for yourself . '' 
Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in . 
In her snug room , with lamps burning before the icon stand , a young lad with a long nose and long hair , wearing a monk 's cassock , sat on the sofa beside her , behind a samovar . 
Near them , in an armchair , sat a thin , shriveled , old woman , with a meek expression on her childlike face . 
`` Andrew , why did n't you warn me ? '' 
said the princess , with mild reproach , as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens . 
`` Charmee de vous voir . 
Je suis tres contente de vous voir , '' * she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand . 
She had known him as a child , and now his friendship with Andrew , his misfortune with his wife , and above all his kindly , simple face disposed her favorably toward him . 
She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say , `` I like you very much , but please do n't laugh at my people . '' 
After exchanging the first greetings , they sat down . 
* `` Delighted to see you . 
I am very glad to see you . '' 
`` Ah , and Ivanushka is here too ! '' 
said Prince Andrew , glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim . 
`` Andrew ! '' 
said Princess Mary , imploringly . 
`` Il faut que vous sachiez que c'est une femme , '' * said Prince Andrew to Pierre . 
`` Andrew , au nom de Dieu ! '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- Princess Mary repeated . 
* `` You must know that this is a woman . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` For heaven 's sake . '' 
It was evident that Prince Andrew 's ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary 's helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long-established relations on the matter . 
`` Mais , ma bonne amie , '' said Prince Andrew , `` vous devriez au contraire m ` etre reconnaissante de ce que j' explique a Pierre votre intimite avec ce jeune homme . '' 
* * `` But , my dear , you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
said Pierre , gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness -LRB- for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him -RRB- into Ivanushka 's face , who , seeing that she was being spoken about , looked round at them all with crafty eyes .
