We have not met for such a long time ... not since we were children . 
You might think that I. . . 
I understand , quite understand . 
I could not have done it myself , I should not have had the courage , but it 's splendid . 
I am very glad to have made your acquaintance . 
It 's queer , '' he added after a pause , `` that you should have suspected me ! '' 
He began to laugh . 
`` Well , what of it ! 
I hope we 'll get better acquainted , '' and he pressed Boris ' hand . 
`` Do you know , I have not once been in to see the count . 
He has not sent for me ... . 
I am sorry for him as a man , but what can one do ? '' 
`` And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across ? '' 
asked Boris with a smile . 
Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject , and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition . 
A footman came in to summon Boris -- the princess was going . 
Pierre , in order to make Boris ' better acquaintance , promised to come to dinner , and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Boris ' eyes . 
After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time , no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword , but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant , intelligent , and resolute young man . 
As often happens in early youth , especially to one who leads a lonely life , he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends . 
Prince Vasili saw the princess off . 
She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful . 
`` It is dreadful , dreadful ! '' 
she was saying , `` but cost me what it may I shall do my duty . 
I will come and spend the night . 
He must not be left like this . 
Every moment is precious . 
I ca n't think why his nieces put it off . 
Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him ! 
... Adieu , Prince ! 
May God support you ... '' `` Adieu , ma bonne , '' answered Prince Vasili turning away from her . 
`` Oh , he is in a dreadful state , '' said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage . 
`` He hardly recognizes anybody . '' 
`` I do n't understand , Mamma -- what is his attitude to Pierre ? '' 
asked the son . 
`` The will will show that , my dear ; our fate also depends on it . '' 
`` But why do you expect that he will leave us anything ? '' 
`` Ah , my dear ! 
He is so rich , and we are so poor ! '' 
`` Well , that is hardly a sufficient reason , Mamma ... '' `` Oh , Heaven ! 
How ill he is ! '' 
exclaimed the mother . 
After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov , Countess Rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes . 
At last she rang . 
`` What is the matter with you , my dear ? '' 
she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes . 
`` Do n't you wish to serve me ? 
Then I 'll find you another place . '' 
The countess was upset by her friend 's sorrow and humiliating poverty , and was therefore out of sorts , a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid `` my dear '' and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness . 
`` I am very sorry , ma'am , '' answered the maid . 
`` Ask the count to come to me . ''
