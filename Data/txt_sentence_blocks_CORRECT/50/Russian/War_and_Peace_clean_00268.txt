She drew near to him and stopped . 
He took her hand and kissed it . 
`` Do you love me ? '' 
`` Yes , yes ! '' 
Natasha murmured as if in vexation . 
Then she sighed loudly and , catching her breath more and more quickly , began to sob . 
`` What is it ? 
What 's the matter ? '' 
`` Oh , I am so happy ! '' 
she replied , smiled through her tears , bent over closer to him , paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might , and then kissed him . 
Prince Andrew held her hands , looked into her eyes , and did not find in his heart his former love for her . 
Something in him had suddenly changed ; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire , but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness , fear at her devotion and trustfulness , and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever . 
The present feeling , though not so bright and poetic as the former , was stronger and more serious . 
`` Did your mother tell you that it can not be for a year ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew , still looking into her eyes . 
`` Is it possible that I -- the ` chit of a girl , ' as everybody called me , '' thought Natasha -- `` is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange , dear , clever man whom even my father looks up to ? 
Can it be true ? 
Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life , that now I am grown up , that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed ? 
Yes , but what did he ask me ? '' 
`` No , '' she replied , but she had not understood his question . 
`` Forgive me ! '' 
he said . 
`` But you are so young , and I have already been through so much in life . 
I am afraid for you , you do not yet know yourself . '' 
Natasha listened with concentrated attention , trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words . 
`` Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be , '' continued Prince Andrew , `` it will give you time to be sure of yourself . 
I ask you to make me happy in a year , but you are free : our engagement shall remain a secret , and should you find that you do not love me , or should you come to love ... '' said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile . 
`` Why do you say that ? '' 
Natasha interrupted him . 
`` You know that from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you , '' she cried , quite convinced that she spoke the truth . 
`` In a year you will learn to know yourself ... '' `` A whole year ! '' 
Natasha repeated suddenly , only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year . 
`` But why a year ? 
Why a year ? 
... '' Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay . 
Natasha did not hear him . 
`` And ca n't it be helped ? '' 
she asked . 
Prince Andrew did not reply , but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision . 
`` It 's awful ! 
Oh , it 's awful ! 
awful ! '' 
Natasha suddenly cried , and again burst into sobs . 
`` I shall die , waiting a year : it 's impossible , it 's awful ! '' 
She looked into her lover 's face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity . 
`` No , no ! 
I 'll do anything ! '' 
she said , suddenly checking her tears . 
`` I am so happy . '' 
The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing .
