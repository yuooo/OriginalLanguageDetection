In despair he hid his face in his hands . 
`` Do n't worry yourself so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' observed the prosecutor , `` everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards , and what you do n't agree to we 'll alter as you like . 
But now I 'll ask you one little question for the second time . 
Has no one , absolutely no one , heard from you of that money you sewed up ? 
That , I must tell you , is almost impossible to believe . '' 
`` No one , no one , I told you so before , or you 've not understood anything ! 
Let me alone ! '' 
`` Very well , this matter is bound to be explained , and there 's plenty of time for it , but meantime , consider ; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad , and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you 'd spent here ; three thousand , not fifteen hundred . 
And now , too , when you got hold of the money you had yesterday , you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you . '' 
`` You 've got not dozens , but hundreds of witnesses , two hundred witnesses , two hundred have heard it , thousands have heard it ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Well , you see , all bear witness to it . 
And the word all means something . '' 
`` It means nothing . 
I talked rot , and everyone began repeating it . '' 
`` But what need had you to ` talk rot , ' as you call it ? '' 
`` The devil knows . 
From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money ... . 
To try and forget that money I had sewn up , perhaps ... yes , that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question ? 
Well , I told a fib , and that was the end of it ; once I 'd said it , I did n't care to correct it . 
What does a man tell lies for sometimes ? '' 
`` That 's very difficult to decide , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what makes a man tell lies , '' observed the prosecutor impressively . 
`` Tell me , though , was that ` amulet , ' as you call it , on your neck , a big thing ? '' 
`` No , not big . '' 
`` How big , for instance ? '' 
`` If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half , that would be the size . '' 
`` You 'd better show us the remains of it . 
You must have them somewhere . '' 
`` Damnation , what nonsense ! 
I do n't know where they are . '' 
`` But excuse me : where and when did you take it off your neck ? 
According to your own evidence you did n't go home . '' 
`` When I was going from Fenya 's to Perhotin 's , on the way I tore it off my neck and took out the money . '' 
`` In the dark ? '' 
`` What should I want a light for ? 
I did it with my fingers in one minute . '' 
`` Without scissors , in the street ? '' 
`` In the market-place I think it was . 
Why scissors ? 
It was an old rag . 
It was torn in a minute . '' 
`` Where did you put it afterwards ? '' 
`` I dropped it there . '' 
`` Where was it , exactly ? '' 
`` In the market-place , in the market-place ! 
The devil knows whereabouts . 
What do you want to know for ? '' 
`` That 's extremely important , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
It would be material evidence in your favour . 
How is it you do n't understand that ?
