Allow me to have the pistol . '' 
`` Be off , thou base slave ! 
Touch me not ! 
See this ? '' 
shouted Makar Alexeevich , brandishing the pistol . 
`` Board them ! '' 
`` Catch hold ! '' 
whispered Gerasim to the porter . 
They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door . 
The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy , hoarse voice . 
Suddenly a fresh sound , a piercing feminine scream , reverberated from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule . 
`` It 's them ! 
Gracious heavens ! 
O Lord , four of them , horsemen ! '' 
she cried . 
Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go , and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard . 
Pierre , having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French , stood at the half-open door of the corridor , intending to conceal himself as soon as the French entered . 
But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire -- an irresistible curiosity kept him there . 
There were two of them . 
One was an officer -- a tall , soldierly , handsome man -- the other evidently a private or an orderly , sunburned , short , and thin , with sunken cheeks and a dull expression . 
The officer walked in front , leaning on a stick and slightly limping . 
When he had advanced a few steps he stopped , having apparently decided that these were good quarters , turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance , and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses . 
Having done that , the officer , lifting his elbow with a smart gesture , stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat . 
`` Bonjour , la compagnie ! '' 
* said he gaily , smiling and looking about him . 
* `` Good day , everybody ! '' 
No one gave any reply . 
`` Vous etes le bourgeois ? '' 
* the officer asked Gerasim . 
* `` Are you the master here ? '' 
Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look . 
`` Quartier , quartier , logement ! '' 
said the officer , looking down at the little man with a condescending and good-natured smile . 
`` Les francais sont de bons enfants . 
Que diable ! 
Voyons ! 
Ne nous fachons pas , mon vieux ! '' 
* added he , clapping the scared and silent Gerasim on the shoulder . 
`` Well , does no one speak French in this establishment ? '' 
he asked again in French , looking around and meeting Pierre 's eyes . 
Pierre moved away from the door . 
* `` Quarters , quarters , lodgings ! 
The French are good fellows . 
What the devil ! 
There , do n't let us be cross , old fellow ! '' 
Again the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house . 
`` Master , not here -- do n't understand ... me , you ... '' said Gerasim , trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them . 
Still smiling , the French officer spread out his hands before Gerasim 's nose , intimating that he did not understand him either , and moved , limping , to the door at which Pierre was standing . 
Pierre wished to go away and conceal himself , but at that moment he saw Makar Alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand . 
With a madman 's cunning , Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman , raised his pistol , and took aim .
