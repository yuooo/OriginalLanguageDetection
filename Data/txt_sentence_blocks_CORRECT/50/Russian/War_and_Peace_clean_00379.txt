said Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` Go and get it for me , '' said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
`` You know -- under the paperweight on the little table . '' 
Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly . 
`` No , do n't ! '' 
he exclaimed with a frown . 
`` You go , Michael Ivanovich . '' 
Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study . 
But as soon as he had left the room the old prince , looking uneasily round , threw down his napkin and went himself . 
`` They ca n't do anything ... always make some muddle , '' he muttered . 
While he was away Princess Mary , Dessalles , Mademoiselle Bourienne , and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence . 
The old prince returned with quick steps , accompanied by Michael Ivanovich , bringing the letter and a plan . 
These he put down beside him -- not letting anyone read them at dinner . 
On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and , spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it , told her to read the letter aloud . 
When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father . 
He was examining the plan , evidently engrossed in his own ideas . 
`` What do you think of it , Prince ? '' 
Dessalles ventured to ask . 
`` I ? 
I ? 
... '' said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened , and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building . 
`` Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that ... '' `` Ha ha ha ! 
The theater of war ! '' 
said the prince . 
`` I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen . '' 
Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince , who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper , but Princess Mary , forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen , thought that what her father was saying was correct . 
`` When the snow melts they 'll sink in the Polish swamps . 
Only they could fail to see it , '' the prince continued , evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent . 
`` Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner , then things would have taken a different turn ... '' `` But , Prince , '' Dessalles began timidly , `` the letter mentions Vitebsk ... '' `` Ah , the letter ? 
Yes ... '' replied the prince peevishly . 
`` Yes ... yes ... '' His face suddenly took on a morose expression . 
He paused . 
`` Yes , he writes that the French were beaten at ... at ... what river is it ? '' 
Dessalles dropped his eyes . 
`` The prince says nothing about that , '' he remarked gently . 
`` Does n't he ? 
But I did n't invent it myself . '' 
No one spoke for a long time . 
`` Yes ... yes ... Well , Michael Ivanovich , '' he suddenly went on , raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building , `` tell me how you mean to alter it ... '' Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan , and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room . 
Princess Mary saw Dessalles ' embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father , noticed his silence , and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son 's letter on the drawing-room table ; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence , but was afraid even to think about it . 
In the evening Michael Ivanovich , sent by the prince , came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew 's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room . 
She gave it to him and , unpleasant as it was to her to do so , ventured to ask him what her father was doing . 
`` Always busy , '' replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale . 
`` He 's worrying very much about the new building . 
He has been reading a little , but now '' -- Michael Ivanovich went on , lowering his voice -- `` now he 's at his desk , busy with his will , I expect . '' 
-LRB- One of the prince 's favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his `` will . '' -RRB- 
`` And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk ? '' 
asked Princess Mary . 
`` Oh , yes , he has been waiting to start for some time . '' 
When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter , the old prince , with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes , was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles , holding a paper in his outstretched hand , and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript -- his `` Remarks '' as he termed it -- which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death .
