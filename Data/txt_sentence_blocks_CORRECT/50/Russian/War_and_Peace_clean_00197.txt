`` If it true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal , tell him he is a fool , that 's all ! '' 
`` No , he 's not a fool ! '' 
replied Natasha indignantly and seriously . 
`` Well then , what do you want ? 
You 're all in love nowadays . 
Well , if you are in love , marry him ! '' 
said the countess , with a laugh of annoyance . 
`` Good luck to you ! '' 
`` No , Mamma , I 'm not in love with him , I suppose I 'm not in love with him . '' 
`` Well then , tell him so . '' 
`` Mamma , are you cross ? 
Do n't be cross , dear ! 
Is it my fault ? '' 
`` No , but what is it , my dear ? 
Do you want me to go and tell him ? '' 
said the countess smiling . 
`` No , I will do it myself , only tell me what to say . 
It 's all very well for you , '' said Natasha , with a responsive smile . 
`` You should have seen how he said it ! 
I know he did not mean to say it , but it came out accidently . '' 
`` Well , all the same , you must refuse him . '' 
`` No , I must n't . 
I am so sorry for him ! 
He 's so nice . '' 
`` Well then , accept his offer . 
It 's high time for you to be married , '' answered the countess sharply and sarcastically . 
`` No , Mamma , but I 'm so sorry for him . 
I do n't know how I 'm to say it . '' 
`` And there 's nothing for you to say . 
I shall speak to him myself , '' said the countess , indignant that they should have dared to treat this little Natasha as grown up . 
`` No , not on any account ! 
I will tell him myself , and you 'll listen at the door , '' and Natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall , where Denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands . 
He jumped up at the sound of her light step . 
`` Nataly , '' he said , moving with rapid steps toward her , `` decide my fate . 
It is in your hands . '' 
`` Vasili Dmitrich , I 'm so sorry for you ! 
... No , but you are so nice ... but it wo n't do ... not that ... but as a friend , I shall always love you . '' 
Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not understand . 
She kissed his rough curly black head . 
At this instant , they heard the quick rustle of the countess ' dress . 
She came up to them . 
`` Vasili Dmitrich , I thank you for the honor , '' she said , with an embarrassed voice , though it sounded severe to Denisov -- `` but my daughter is so young , and I thought that , as my son 's friend , you would have addressed yourself first to me . 
In that case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal . '' 
`` Countess ... '' said Denisov , with downcast eyes and a guilty face . 
He tried to say more , but faltered . 
Natasha could not remain calm , seeing him in such a plight . 
She began to sob aloud . 
`` Countess , I have done w ` ong , '' Denisov went on in an unsteady voice , `` but believe me , I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over ... '' He looked at the countess , and seeing her severe face said : `` Well , good-by , Countess , '' and kissing her hand , he left the room with quick resolute strides , without looking at Natasha . 
Next day Rostov saw Denisov off . 
He not wish to stay another day in Moscow .
