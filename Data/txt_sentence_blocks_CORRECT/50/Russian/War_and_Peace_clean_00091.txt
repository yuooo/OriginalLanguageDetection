The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room . 
Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say . 
`` Tell me , when did the battle begin ? '' 
he asked hurriedly . 
Prince Andrew replied . 
Then followed other questions just as simple : `` Was Kutuzov well ? 
When had he left Krems ? '' 
and so on . 
The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions - the answers to these questions , as was only too evident , did not interest him . 
`` At what o'clock did the battle begin ? '' 
asked the Emperor . 
`` I can not inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the front , but at Durrenstein , where I was , our attack began after five in the afternoon , '' replied Bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account , which he had ready in his mind , of all he knew and had seen . 
But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him . 
`` How many miles ? '' 
`` From where to where , Your Majesty ? '' 
`` From Durrenstein to Krems . '' 
`` Three and a half miles , Your Majesty . '' 
`` The French have abandoned the left bank ? '' 
`` According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night . '' 
`` Is there sufficient forage in Krems ? '' 
`` Forage has not been supplied to the extent ... '' The Emperor interrupted him . 
`` At what o'clock was General Schmidt killed ? '' 
`` At seven o'clock , I believe . '' 
`` At seven o'clock ? 
It 's very sad , very sad ! '' 
The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed . 
Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides . 
Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words . 
Yesterday 's adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace , and offered him his own house . 
The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade , which the Emperor was conferring on him . 
The Empress ' chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty . 
The archduchess also wished to see him . 
He did not know whom to answer , and for a few seconds collected his thoughts . 
Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder , led him to the window , and began to talk to him . 
Contrary to Bilibin 's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received . 
A thanksgiving service was arranged , Kutuzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa , and the whole army received rewards . 
Bolkonski was invited everywhere , and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries . 
Between four and five in the afternoon , having made all his calls , he was returning to Bilibin 's house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brunn . 
At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage . 
Franz , Bilibin 's man , was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door . 
Before returning to Bilibin 's Prince Andrew had gone to bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign , and had spent some time in the shop . 
`` What is it ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Oh , your excellency ! '' 
said Franz , with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle , `` we are to move on still farther . 
The scoundrel is again at our heels ! '' 
`` Eh ? 
What ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
Bilibin came out to meet him .
