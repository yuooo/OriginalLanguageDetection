To Nikolay Parfenovitch 's direct question , had he noticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand , as he must have been able to see the sum better than anyone when he took the note from him , Maximov , in the most positive manner , declared that there was twenty thousand . 
`` Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before , then ? '' 
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch , with a smile . 
`` To be sure I have , not twenty , but seven , when my wife mortgaged my little property . 
She 'd only let me look at it from a distance , boasting of it to me . 
It was a very thick bundle , all rainbow-coloured notes . 
And Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's were all rainbow-coloured ... '' He was not kept long . 
At last it was Grushenka 's turn . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might have on Mitya , and he muttered a few words of admonition to him , but Mitya bowed his head in silence , giving him to understand `` that he would not make a scene . '' 
Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in . 
She entered with a stern and gloomy face , that looked almost composed , and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
She was very pale , she seemed to be cold , and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl . 
She was suffering from a slight feverish chill - the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night . 
Her grave air , her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favourable impression on everyone . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit `` fascinated . '' 
He admitted himself , when talking about it afterwards , that only then had he seen `` how handsome the woman was , '' for , though he had seen her several times he had always looked upon her as something of a `` provincial hetaira . '' 
`` She has the manners of the best society , '' he said enthusiastically , gossiping about her in a circle of ladies . 
But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies , who immediately called him a `` naughty man , '' to his great satisfaction . 
As she entered the room , Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya , who looked at her uneasily . 
But her face reassured him at once . 
After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings , Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her , hesitating a little , but preserving the most courteous manner , on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied : `` He was an acquaintance . 
He came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month . '' 
To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness , that , though `` at times '' she had thought him attractive , she had not loved him , but had won his heart as well as his old father 's `` in my nasty spite , '' that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and everyone else ; but that had only amused her . 
She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch , she had simply been laughing at him . 
`` I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month . 
I was expecting another man who had wronged me . 
But I think , '' she said in conclusion , `` that there 's no need for you to inquire about that , nor for me to answer you , for that 's my own affair . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint . 
He again dismissed the `` romantic '' aspect of the case and passed to the serious one , that is , to the question of most importance , concerning the three thousand roubles . 
Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe , and , though she had not counted the money herself , she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's own lips . 
`` Did he tell you that alone , or before someone else , or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence ? '' 
the prosecutor inquired immediately . 
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people , and had heard him say so when they were alone . 
`` Did he say it to you alone once , or several times ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor , and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence . 
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew , too , where that money had come from , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` And did you never , once , hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand , but less , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use ? '' 
`` No , I never heard that , '' answered Grushenka . 
It was explained further that Mitya had , on the contrary , often told her that he had n't a farthing . 
`` He was always expecting to get some from his father , '' said Grushenka in conclusion . 
`` Did he never say before you ... casually , or in a moment of irritation , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly , `` that he intended to make an attempt on his father 's life ? '' 
`` Ach , he did say so , '' sighed Grushenka . 
`` Once or several times ? '' 
`` He mentioned it several times , always in anger . '' 
`` And did you believe he would do it ? '' 
`` No , I never believed it , '' she answered firmly . 
`` I had faith in his noble heart . '' 
`` Gentlemen , allow me , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna , in your presence . ''
