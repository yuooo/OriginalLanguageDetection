`` What for ? 
I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life . '' 
`` Do n't be anxious about my nature , '' Kolya interrupted , not without complacency . 
`` But it 's true that I am stupidly sensitive , crudely sensitive . 
You smiled just now , and I fancied you seemed to - '' `` Oh , my smile meant something quite different . 
I 'll tell you why I smiled . 
Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia , on our students and schoolboys of to-day . 
` Show a Russian schoolboy , ' he writes , ' a map of the stars , which he knows nothing about , and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it . ' 
No knowledge and unbounded conceit - that 's what the German meant to say about the Russian schoolboy . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perfectly right , '' Kolya laughed suddenly , `` exactly so ! 
Bravo the German ! 
But he did not see the good side , what do you think ? 
Conceit may be , that comes from youth , that will be corrected if need be , but , on the other hand , there is an independent spirit almost from childhood , boldness of thought and conviction , and not the spirit of these sausage makers , grovelling before authority ... . 
But the German was right all the same . 
Bravo the German ! 
But Germans want strangling all the same . 
Though they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled . '' 
`` Strangled , what for ? '' 
smiled Alyosha . 
`` Well , perhaps I am talking nonsense , I agree . 
I am awfully childish sometimes , and when I am pleased about anything I ca n't restrain myself and am ready to talk any stuff . 
But , I say , we are chattering away here about nothing , and that doctor has been a long time in there . 
But perhaps he 's examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina . 
I liked that Nina , you know . 
She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away , ` Why did n't you come before ? ' 
And in such a voice , so reproachfully ! 
I think she is awfully nice and pathetic . '' 
`` Yes , yes ! 
Well , you 'll be coming often , you will see what she is like . 
It would do you a great deal of good to know people like that , to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people , '' Alyosha observed warmly . 
`` That would have more effect on you than anything . '' 
`` Oh , how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner ! '' 
Kolya exclaimed , with bitter feeling . 
`` Yes , it 's a great pity . 
You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you . 
And how he fretted for you to come ! '' 
`` Do n't tell me ! 
You make it worse ! 
But it serves me right . 
What kept me from coming was my conceit , my egoistic vanity , and the beastly wilfulness , which I never can get rid of , though I 've been struggling with it all my life . 
I see that now . 
I am a beast in lots of ways , Karamazov ! '' 
`` No , you have a charming nature , though it 's been distorted , and I quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous , morbidly sensitive boy , '' Alyosha answered warmly . 
`` And you say that to me ! '' 
cried Kolya ; `` and would you believe it , I thought - I 've thought several times since I 've been here - that you despised me ! 
If only you knew how I prize your opinion ! '' 
`` But are you really so sensitive ? 
At your age ! 
Would you believe it , just now , when you were telling your story , I thought , as I watched you , that you must be very sensitive ! '' 
`` You thought so ?
