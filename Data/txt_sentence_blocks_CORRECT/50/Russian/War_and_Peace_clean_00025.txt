`` There are not many left of us old friends ! 
That 's why I so value your friendship . '' 
Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused . 
The countess pressed her friend 's hand . 
`` Vera , '' she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite , `` how is it you have so little tact ? 
Do n't you see you are not wanted here ? 
Go to the other girls , or ... '' The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt . 
`` If you had told me sooner , Mamma , I would have gone , '' she replied as she rose to go to her own room . 
But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting , one pair at each window . 
She stopped and smiled scornfully . 
Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her , the first he had ever written . 
Boris and Natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered . 
Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty , happy faces . 
It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love ; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera . 
`` How often have I asked you not to take my things ? '' 
she said . 
`` You have a room of your own , '' and she took the inkstand from Nicholas . 
`` In a minute , in a minute , '' he said , dipping his pen . 
`` You always manage to do things at the wrong time , '' continued Vera . 
`` You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you . '' 
Though what she said was quite just , perhaps for that very reason no one replied , and the four simply looked at one another . 
She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand . 
`` And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris , or between you two ? 
It 's all nonsense ! '' 
`` Now , Vera , what does it matter to you ? '' 
said Natasha in defense , speaking very gently . 
She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone . 
`` Very silly , '' said Vera . 
`` I am ashamed of you . 
Secrets indeed ! '' 
`` All have secrets of their own , '' answered Natasha , getting warmer . 
`` We do n't interfere with you and Berg . '' 
`` I should think not , '' said Vera , `` because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior . 
But I 'll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with Boris . '' 
`` Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me , '' remarked Boris . 
`` I have nothing to complain of . '' 
`` Do n't , Boris ! 
You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome , '' said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly . 
-LRB- She used the word `` diplomat , '' which was just then much in vogue among the children , in the special sense they attached to it . -RRB- 
`` Why does she bother me ? '' 
And she added , turning to Vera , `` You 'll never understand it , because you 've never loved anyone . 
You have no heart ! 
You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more '' -LRB- this nickname , bestowed on Vera by Nicholas , was considered very stinging -RRB- , `` and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people ! 
Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please , '' she finished quickly . 
`` I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors ... '' `` Well , now you 've done what you wanted , '' put in Nicholas -- `` said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them . 
Let 's go to the nursery . '' 
All four , like a flock of scared birds , got up and left the room . 
`` The unpleasant things were said to me , '' remarked Vera , `` I said none to anyone . '' 
`` Madame de Genlis ! 
Madame de Genlis ! ''
