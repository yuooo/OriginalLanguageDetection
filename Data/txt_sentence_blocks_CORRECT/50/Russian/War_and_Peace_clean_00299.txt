asked Natasha , suddenly beaming all over with joy . 
`` Oh , how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows ! 
... Natasha -- are you glad ? '' 
`` I am so glad , so glad ! 
I was beginning to be vexed with you . 
I did not tell you , but you have been treating her badly . 
What a heart she has , Nicholas ! 
I am horrid sometimes , but I was ashamed to be happy while Sonya was not , '' continued Natasha . 
`` Now I am so glad ! 
Well , run back to her . '' 
`` No , wait a bit ... . 
Oh , how funny you look ! '' 
cried Nicholas , peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new , unusual , and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before . 
`` Natasha , it 's magical , is n't it ? '' 
`` Yes , '' she replied . 
`` You have done splendidly . '' 
`` Had I seen her before as she is now , '' thought Nicholas , `` I should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me , and all would have been well . '' 
`` So you are glad and I have done right ? '' 
`` Oh , quite right ! 
I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it . 
Mamma said she was angling for you . 
How could she say such a thing ! 
I nearly stormed at Mamma . 
I will never let anyone say anything bad of Sonya , for there is nothing but good in her . '' 
`` Then it 's all right ? '' 
said Nicholas , again scrutinizing the expression of his sister 's face to see if she was in earnest . 
Then he jumped down and , his boots scrunching the snow , ran back to his sleigh . 
The same happy , smiling Circassian , with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood , was still sitting there , and that Circassian was Sonya , and that Sonya was certainly his future happy and loving wife . 
When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the Melyukovs ' , the girls went to their bedroom . 
When they had undressed , but without washing off the cork mustaches , they sat a long time talking of their happiness . 
They talked of how they would live when they were married , how their husbands would be friends , and how happy they would be . 
On Natasha 's table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared beforehand . 
`` Only when will all that be ? 
I am afraid never ... . 
It would be too good ! '' 
said Natasha , rising and going to the looking glasses . 
`` Sit down , Natasha ; perhaps you 'll see him , '' said Sonya . 
Natasha lit the candles , one on each side of one of the looking glasses , and sat down . 
`` I see someone with a mustache , '' said Natasha , seeing her own face . 
`` You must n't laugh , Miss , '' said Dunyasha . 
With Sonya 's help and the maid 's , Natasha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other ; her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent . 
She sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting -LRB- from tales she had heard -RRB- to see a coffin , or him , Prince Andrew , in that last dim , indistinctly outlined square . 
But ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin , she saw nothing . 
She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses . 
`` Why is it others see things and I do n't ? '' 
she said . 
`` You sit down now , Sonya . 
You absolutely must , tonight ! 
Do it for me ... . 
Today I feel so frightened ! ''
