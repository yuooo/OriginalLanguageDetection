`` The step must be taken but I can not , I can not ! '' 
thought Pierre , and he again began speaking about indifferent matters , about Sergey Kuzmich , asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly . 
Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it . 
When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room , the princess , his wife , was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre . 
`` Of course , it is a very brilliant match , but happiness , my dear ... '' `` Marriages are made in heaven , '' replied the elderly lady . 
Prince Vasili passed by , seeming not to hear the ladies , and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room . 
He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing . 
His head sank forward and then he roused himself . 
`` Aline , '' he said to his wife , `` go and see what they are about . '' 
The princess went up to the door , passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air , and glanced into the little drawing room . 
Pierre and Helene still sat talking just as before . 
`` Still the same , '' she said to her husband . 
Prince Vasili frowned , twisting his mouth , his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse , unpleasant expression peculiar to him . 
Shaking himself , he rose , threw back his head , and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room . 
With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre . 
His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
said Prince Vasili . 
`` My wife has told me everything ! '' 
-LRB- He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter . -RRB- 
-- `` My dear boy ... Lelya ... I am very pleased . '' 
-LRB- His voice trembled . -RRB- 
`` I loved your father ... and she will make you a good wife ... God bless you ! 
... '' He embraced his daughter , and then again Pierre , and kissed him with his malodorous mouth . 
Tears actually moistened his cheeks . 
`` Princess , come here ! '' 
he shouted . 
The old princess came in and also wept . 
The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too . 
Pierre was kissed , and he kissed the beautiful Helene 's hand several times . 
After a while they were left alone again . 
`` All this had to be and could not be otherwise , '' thought Pierre , `` so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad . 
It is good because it 's definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt . '' 
Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence , looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell . 
`` Helene ! '' 
he said aloud and paused . 
`` Something special is always said in such cases , '' he thought , but could not remember what it was that people say . 
He looked at her face . 
She drew nearer to him . 
Her face flushed . 
`` Oh , take those off ... those ... '' she said , pointing to his spectacles . 
Pierre took them off , and his eyes , besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed , had also a frightened and inquiring look . 
He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it , but with a rapid , almost brutal movement of her head , she intercepted his lips and met them with her own . 
Her face struck Pierre , by its altered , unpleasantly excited expression . 
`` It is too late now , it 's done ; besides I love her , '' thought Pierre . 
`` Je vous aime ! '' 
* he said , remembering what has to be said at such moments : but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself . 
* `` I love you . '' 
Six weeks later he was married , and settled in Count Bezukhov 's large , newly furnished Petersburg house , the happy possessor , as people said , of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money . 
Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili in November , 1805 , announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit .
