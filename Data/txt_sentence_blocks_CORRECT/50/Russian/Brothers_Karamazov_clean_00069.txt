For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad . 
`` What is it ? 
I 'm not insane , '' said Dmitri , looking intently and earnestly at him . 
`` No fear . 
I am sending you to father , and I know what I 'm saying . 
I believe in miracles . '' 
`` In miracles ? '' 
`` In a miracle of Divine Providence . 
God knows my heart . 
He sees my despair . 
He sees the whole picture . 
Surely He wo n't let something awful happen . 
Alyosha , I believe in miracles . 
Go ! '' 
`` I am going . 
Tell me , will you wait for me here ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I know it will take some time . 
You ca n't go at him point blank . 
He 's drunk now . 
I 'll wait three hours - four , five , six , seven . 
Only remember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day , if it has to be at midnight , with the money or without the money , and say , ` He sends his compliments to you . ' 
I want you to say that verse to her : ` He sends his compliments to you . ' '' 
`` Mitya ! 
And what if Grushenka comes to-day - if not to-day , or the next day ? '' 
`` Grushenka ? 
I shall see her . 
I shall rush out and prevent it . '' 
`` And if - ? '' 
`` If there 's an if , it will be murder . 
I could n't endure it . '' 
`` Who will be murdered ? '' 
`` The old man . 
I sha n't kill her . '' 
`` Brother , what are you saying ? '' 
`` Oh , I do n't know ... . 
I do n't know . 
Perhaps I sha n't kill , and perhaps I shall . 
I 'm afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his face at that moment . 
I hate his ugly throat , his nose , his eyes , his shameless snigger . 
I feel a physical repulsion . 
That 's what I 'm afraid of . 
That 's what may be too much for me . '' 
`` I 'll go , Mitya . 
I believe that God will order things for the best , that nothing awful may happen . '' 
`` And I will sit and wait for the miracle . 
And if it does n't come to pass - '' Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his father 's house . 
Smerdyakov HE did in fact find his father still at table . 
Though there was a dining-room in the house , the table was laid as usual in the drawing room , which was the largest room , and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation . 
The furniture was white and very old , upholstered in old , red , silky material .
