What is this ? '' 
shouted the regimental commander , thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth , which contrasted with the others . 
`` What have you been after ? 
The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place ? 
Eh ? 
I 'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade ... . 
Eh ... ? '' 
The commander of the company , with his eyes fixed on his superior , pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap , as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation . 
`` Well , why do n't you speak ? 
Whom have you got there dressed up as a Hungarian ? '' 
said the commander with an austere gibe . 
`` Your excellency ... '' `` Well , your excellency , what ? 
Your excellency ! 
But what about your excellency ? 
... nobody knows . '' 
`` Your excellency , it 's the officer Dolokhov , who has been reduced to the ranks , '' said the captain softly . 
`` Well ? 
Has he been degraded into a field marshal , or into a soldier ? 
If a soldier , he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others . '' 
`` Your excellency , you gave him leave yourself , on the march . '' 
`` Gave him leave ? 
Leave ? 
That 's just like you young men , '' said the regimental commander cooling down a little . 
`` Leave indeed ... . 
One says a word to you and you ... What ? '' 
he added with renewed irritation , `` I beg you to dress your men decently . '' 
And the commander , turning to look at the adjutant , directed his jerky steps down the line . 
He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath . 
Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge , at another because his line was not straight , he reached the third company . 
`` H-o-o-w are you standing ? 
Where 's your leg ? 
Your leg ? '' 
shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice , while there were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray uniform . 
Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee , looking straight with his clear , insolent eyes in the general 's face . 
`` Why a blue coat ? 
Off with it ... Sergeant major ! 
Change his coat ... the ras ... '' he did not finish . 
`` General , I must obey orders , but I am not bound to endure ... '' Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted . 
`` No talking in the ranks ! 
... No talking , no talking ! '' 
`` Not bound to endure insults , '' Dolokhov concluded in loud , ringing tones . 
The eyes of the general and the soldier met . 
The general became silent , angrily pulling down his tight scarf . 
`` I request you to have the goodness to change your coat , '' he said as he turned away . 
`` He 's coming ! '' 
shouted the signaler at that moment . 
The regimental commander , flushing , ran to his horse , seized the stirrup with trembling hands , threw his body across the saddle , righted himself , drew his saber , and with a happy and resolute countenance , opening his mouth awry , prepared to shout . 
The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless . 
`` Att-ention ! '' 
shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself , severity for the regiment , and welcome for the approaching chief .
