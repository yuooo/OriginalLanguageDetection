Another smith tried to enter the doorway , pressing against the publican with his chest . 
The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly : `` They 're fighting us , lads ! '' 
At that moment the first smith got up and , scratching his bruised face to make it bleed , shouted in a tearful voice : `` Police ! 
Murder ! 
... They 've killed a man , lads ! '' 
`` Oh , gracious me , a man beaten to death -- killed ! 
... '' screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by . 
A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith . 
`` Have n't you robbed people enough -- taking their last shirts ? '' 
said a voice addressing the publican . 
`` What have you killed a man for , you thief ? '' 
The tall lad , standing in the porch , turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now . 
`` Murderer ! '' 
he shouted suddenly to the publican . 
`` Bind him , lads ! '' 
`` I daresay you would like to bind me ! '' 
shouted the publican , pushing away the men advancing on him , and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground . 
As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance , the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision . 
`` I know the law very well , mates ! 
I 'll take the matter to the captain of police . 
You think I wo n't get to him ? 
Robbery is not permitted to anybody now a days ! '' 
shouted the publican , picking up his cap . 
`` Come along then ! 
Come along then ! '' 
the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other , and they moved up the street together . 
The bloodstained smith went beside them . 
The factory hands and others followed behind , talking and shouting . 
At the corner of the Moroseyka , opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker 's signboard , stood a score of thin , worn-out , gloomy-faced bootmakers , wearing overalls and long tattered coats . 
`` He should pay folks off properly , '' a thin workingman , with frowning brows and a straggly beard , was saying . 
`` But he 's sucked our blood and now he thinks he 's quit of us . 
He 's been misleading us all the week and now that he 's brought us to this pass he 's made off . '' 
On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking , and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd . 
`` Where are all the folks going ? '' 
`` Why , to the police , of course ! '' 
`` I say , is it true that we have been beaten ? '' 
`` And what did you think ? 
Look what folks are saying . '' 
Questions and answers were heard . 
The publican , taking advantage of the increased crowd , dropped behind and returned to his tavern . 
The tall youth , not noticing the disappearance of his foe , waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly , attracting general attention to himself . 
It was around him that the people chiefly crowded , expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds . 
`` He must keep order , keep the law , that 's what the government is there for . 
Am I not right , good Christians ? '' 
said the tall youth , with a scarcely perceptible smile . 
`` He thinks there 's no government ! 
How can one do without government ? 
Or else there would be plenty who 'd rob us . '' 
`` Why talk nonsense ? '' 
rejoined voices in the crowd .
