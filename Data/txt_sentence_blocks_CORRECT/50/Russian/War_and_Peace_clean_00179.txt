`` I have killed her lover , yes , killed my wife 's lover . 
Yes , that was it ! 
And why ? 
How did I come to do it ? '' 
-- `` Because you married her , '' answered an inner voice . 
`` But in what was I to blame ? '' 
he asked . 
`` In marrying her without loving her ; in deceiving yourself and her . '' 
And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vasili 's , when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter : `` I love you . '' 
`` It all comes from that ! 
Even then I felt it , '' he thought . 
`` I felt then that it was not so , that I had no right to do it . 
And so it turns out . '' 
He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection . 
Particularly vivid , humiliating , and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there , who , bowing respectfully , looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly , as if expressing respectful understanding of his employer 's happiness . 
`` But how often I have felt proud of her , proud of her majestic beauty and social tact , '' thought he ; `` been proud of my house , in which she received all Petersburg , proud of her unapproachability and beauty . 
So this is what I was proud of ! 
I then thought that I did not understand her . 
How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her , for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires , and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman . 
Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear . 
`` Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders . 
She did not give him the money , but let herself be kissed . 
Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy , and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous : ` Let him do what he pleases , ' she used to say of me . 
One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy . 
She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children , and that she was not going to have any children by me . '' 
Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her , though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles . 
`` I 'm not such a fool ... . 
Just you try it on ... . 
Allez-vous promener , '' * she used to say . 
Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her . 
* `` You clear out of this . '' 
`` Yes , I never loved her , '' said he to himself ; `` I knew she was a depraved woman , '' he repeated , `` but dared not admit it to myself . 
And now there 's Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying , while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado ! '' 
Pierre was one of those people who , in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character , do not seek a confidant in their troubles . 
He digested his sufferings alone . 
`` It is all , all her fault , '' he said to himself ; `` but what of that ? 
Why did I bind myself to her ? 
Why did I say ` Je vous aime ' * to her , which was a lie , and worse than a lie ? 
I am guilty and must endure ... what ? 
A slur on my name ? 
A misfortune for life ? 
Oh , that 's nonsense , '' he thought . 
`` The slur on my name and honor -- that 's all apart from myself . 
* I love you . 
`` Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal , '' came into Pierre 's head , `` and from their point of view they were right , as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr 's death for his sake . 
Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot . 
Who is right and who is wrong ? 
No one ! 
But if you are alive - live : tomorrow you 'll die as I might have died an hour ago . 
And is it worth tormenting oneself , when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity ? ''
