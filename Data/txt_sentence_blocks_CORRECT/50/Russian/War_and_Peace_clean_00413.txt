* `` Think it over ; get into the barque , and take care not to make it a barque of Charon . '' 
`` You do n't spare anyone , '' said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin , beringed fingers . 
Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree . 
`` Bezukhov est ridicule , but he is so kind and good-natured . 
What pleasure is there to be so caustique ? '' 
`` A forfeit ! '' 
cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called `` mon chevalier , '' and who was going with her to Nizhni . 
In Julie 's set , as in many other circles in Moscow , it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary Contributions . 
`` Another forfeit for a Gallicism , '' said a Russian writer who was present . '' 
` What pleasure is there to be ' is not Russian ! '' 
`` You spare no one , '' continued Julie to the young man without heeding the author 's remark . 
`` For caustique -- I am guilty and will pay , and I am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth . 
For Gallicisms I wo n't be responsible , '' she remarked , turning to the author : `` I have neither the money nor the time , like Prince Galitsyn , to engage a master to teach me Russian ! '' 
`` Ah , here he is ! '' 
she added . 
`` Quand on ... No , no , '' she said to the militia officer , `` you wo n't catch me . 
Speak of the sun and you see its rays ! '' 
and she smiled amiably at Pierre . 
`` We were just talking of you , '' she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman . 
`` We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamonov 's . '' 
`` Oh , do n't talk to me of my regiment , '' replied Pierre , kissing his hostess ' hand and taking a seat beside her . 
`` I am so sick of it . '' 
`` You will , of course , command it yourself ? '' 
said Julie , directing a sly , sarcastic glance toward the militia officer . 
The latter in Pierre 's presence had ceased to be caustic , and his face expressed perplexity as to what Julie 's smile might mean . 
In spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature , Pierre 's personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face . 
`` No , '' said Pierre , with a laughing glance at his big , stout body . 
`` I should make too good a target for the French , besides I am afraid I should hardly be able to climb onto a horse . '' 
Among those whom Julie 's guests happened to choose to gossip about were the Rostovs . 
`` I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way , '' said Julie . 
`` And he is so unreasonable , the count himself I mean . 
The Razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near Moscow , but it drags on and on . 
He asks too much . '' 
`` No , I think the sale will come off in a few days , '' said someone . 
`` Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked Julie . 
`` You do n't think Moscow is in danger ? '' 
`` Then why are you leaving ? '' 
`` I ? 
What a question ! 
I am going because ... well , because everyone is going : and besides -- I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon . '' 
`` Well , of course , of course ! 
Let me have some more strips of linen . '' 
`` If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts , '' said the militia officer , speaking of Rostov . 
`` A kindly old man but not up to much . 
And why do they stay on so long in Moscow ? 
They meant to leave for the country long ago . 
Natalie is quite well again now , is n't she ? '' 
Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile .
