`` Well , what do you think ? 
They make soldiers of all classes there . '' 
`` But they do n't understand our talk at all , '' said the dancer with a puzzled smile . 
`` I asked him whose subject he was , and he jabbered in his own way . 
A queer lot ! '' 
`` But it 's strange , friends , '' continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness , `` the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead -- where the battle was you know -- well , those dead had been lying there for nearly a month , and says the peasant , ` they lie as white as paper , clean , and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke . ' '' 
`` Was it from the cold ? '' 
asked someone . 
`` You 're a clever fellow ! 
From the cold indeed ! 
Why , it was hot . 
If it had been from the cold , ours would not have rotted either . 
` But , ' he says , ` go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty . 
So , ' he says , ` we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off : we can hardly do it . 
But theirs , ' he says , ` are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder . ' '' 
All were silent . 
`` It must be from their food , '' said the sergeant major . 
`` They used to gobble the same food as the gentry . '' 
No one contradicted him . 
`` That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still did n't finish carting the dead away . 
And as for the wolves , he says ... '' `` That was a real battle , '' said an old soldier . 
`` It 's the only one worth remembering ; but since that ... it 's only been tormenting folk . '' 
`` And do you know , Daddy , the day before yesterday we ran at them and , my word , they did n't let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees . 
` Pardon ! ' 
they say . 
That 's only one case . 
They say Platov took ` Poleon himself twice . 
But he did n't know the right charm . 
He catches him and catches him -- no good ! 
He turns into a bird in his hands and flies away . 
And there 's no way of killing him either . '' 
`` You 're a first-class liar , Kiselev , when I come to look at you ! '' 
`` Liar , indeed ! 
It 's the real truth . '' 
`` If he fell into my hands , when I 'd caught him I 'd bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down . 
What a lot of men he 's ruined ! '' 
`` Well , anyhow we 're going to end it . 
He wo n't come here again , '' remarked the old soldier , yawning . 
The conversation flagged , and the soldiers began settling down to sleep . 
`` Look at the stars . 
It 's wonderful how they shine ! 
You would think the women had spread out their linen , '' said one of the men , gazing with admiration at the Milky Way . 
`` That 's a sign of a good harvest next year . '' 
`` We shall want some more wood . '' 
`` You warm your back and your belly gets frozen . 
That 's queer . '' 
`` O Lord ! '' 
`` What are you pushing for ? 
Is the fire only for you ? 
Look how he 's sprawling ! ''
