She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar . 
She asked `` Uncle '' for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song . 
After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men , who had been sent to look for them , arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya . 
The count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious , said one of the men . 
Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps . 
Natasha and Nicholas got into the other . 
`` Uncle '' wrapped Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness . 
He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed , so that they had to go round by the ford , and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns . 
`` Good-by , dear niece , '' his voice called out of the darkness -- not the voice Natasha had known previously , but the one that had sung As 't was growing dark last night . 
In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke . 
`` What a darling Uncle is ! '' 
said Natasha , when they had come out onto the highroad . 
`` Yes , '' returned Nicholas . 
`` You 're not cold ? '' 
`` No . 
I 'm quite , quite all right . 
I feel so comfortable ! '' 
answered Natasha , almost perplexed by her feelings . 
They remained silent a long while . 
The night was dark and damp . 
They could not see the horses , but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud . 
What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life ? 
How did they all find place in her ? 
But she was very happy . 
As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As 't was growing dark last night -- the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught . 
`` Got it ? '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` What were you thinking about just now , Nicholas ? '' 
inquired Natasha . 
They were fond of asking one another that question . 
`` I ? '' 
said Nicholas , trying to remember . 
`` Well , you see , first I thought that Rugay , the red hound , was like Uncle , and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him , if not for his riding , then for his manner . 
What a good fellow Uncle is ! 
Do n't you think so ? 
... Well , and you ? '' 
`` I ? 
Wait a bit , wait ... . 
Yes , first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home , but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness , and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe , but in Fairyland . 
And then I thought ... No , nothing else . '' 
`` I know , I expect you thought of him , '' said Nicholas , smiling as Natasha knew by the sound of his voice . 
`` No , '' said Natasha , though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest , and of how he would have liked `` Uncle . '' 
`` And then I was saying to myself all the way , ` How well Anisya carried herself , how well ! ' '' 
And Nicholas heard her spontaneous , happy , ringing laughter . 
`` And do you know , '' she suddenly said , `` I know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now . '' 
`` Rubbish , nonsense , humbug ! '' 
exclaimed Nicholas , and he thought : `` How charming this Natasha of mine is ! 
I have no other friend like her and never shall have . 
Why should she marry ? 
We might always drive about together ! ''
