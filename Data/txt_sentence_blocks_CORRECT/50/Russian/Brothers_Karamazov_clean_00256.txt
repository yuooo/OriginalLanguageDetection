I 'm coming , too . 
I 'm here till morning . 
Gentlemen , may I stay with you till morning ? 
Only till morning , for the last time , in this same room ? '' 
So he finished , turning to the fat little man , with the pipe , sitting on the sofa . 
The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and observed severely : `` Panie , * we 're here in private . 
There are other rooms . '' 
* Pan and Panie mean Mr. in Polish . 
Pani means Mrs. , Panovie , gentlemen . 
`` Why , it 's you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ! 
What do you mean ? '' 
answered Kalgonov suddenly . 
`` Sit down with us . 
How are you ? '' 
`` Delighted to see you , dear ... and precious fellow , I always thought a lot of you . '' 
Mitya responded , joyfully and eagerly , at once holding out his hand across the table . 
`` Aie ! 
How tight you squeeze ! 
You 've quite broken my fingers , '' laughed Kalganov . 
`` He always squeezes like that , always , '' Grushenka put in gaily , with a timid smile , seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya 's face that he was not going to make a scene . 
She was watching him with intense curiosity and still some uneasiness . 
She was impressed by something about him , and indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment . 
`` Good evening , '' Maximov ventured blandly on the left . 
Mitya rushed up to him , too . 
`` Good evening . 
You 're here , too ! 
How glad I am to find you here , too ! 
Gentlemen , gentlemen , I - '' -LRB- He addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe again , evidently taking him for the most important person present . -RRB- 
`` I flew here ... . 
I wanted to spend my last day , my last hour in this room , in this very room ... where I , too , adored ... my queen ... . 
Forgive me , Panie , '' he cried wildly , `` I flew here and vowed - Oh , do n't be afraid , it 's my last night ! 
Let 's drink to our good understanding . 
They 'll bring the wine at once ... . 
I brought this with me . '' 
-LRB- Something made him pull out his bundle of notes . -RRB- 
`` Allow me , panie ! 
I want to have music , singing , a revel , as we had before . 
But the worm , the unnecessary worm , will crawl away , and there 'll be no more of him . 
I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night . '' 
He was almost choking . 
There was so much , so much he wanted to say , but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips . 
The Pole gazed fixedly at him , at the bundle of notes in his hand ; looked at Grushenka , and was in evident perplexity . 
`` If my suverin lady is permitting - '' he was beginning . 
`` What does ` suverin ' mean ? 
` Sovereign , ' I suppose ? '' 
interrupted Grushenka . 
`` I ca n't help laughing at you , the way you talk . 
Sit down , Mitya , what are you talking about ? 
Do n't frighten us , please . 
You wo n't frighten us , will you ?
