Really I have some , '' Rostov repeated . 
`` No , I tell you . '' 
And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow . 
`` Where have you put it , Wostov ? '' 
`` Under the lower pillow . '' 
`` It 's not there . '' 
Denisov threw both pillows on the floor . 
The purse was not there . 
`` That 's a miwacle . '' 
`` Wait , have n't you dropped it ? '' 
said Rostov , picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them . 
He pulled off the quilt and shook it . 
The purse was not there . 
`` Dear me , can I have forgotten ? 
No , I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure , '' said Rostov . 
`` I put it just here . 
Where is it ? '' 
he asked , turning to Lavrushka . 
`` I have n't been in the room . 
It must be where you put it . '' 
`` But it is n't ? 
... '' `` You 're always like that ; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it . 
Feel in your pockets . '' 
`` No , if I had n't thought of it being a treasure , '' said Rostov , `` but I remember putting it there . '' 
Lavrushka turned all the bedding over , looked under the bed and under the table , searched everywhere , and stood still in the middle of the room . 
Denisov silently watched Lavrushka 's movements , and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denisov glanced at Rostov . 
`` Wostov , you 've not been playing schoolboy twicks ... '' Rostov felt Denisov 's gaze fixed on him , raised his eyes , and instantly dropped them again . 
All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes . 
He could not draw breath . 
`` And there has n't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves . 
It must be here somewhere , '' said Lavrushka . 
`` Now then , you devil 's puppet , look alive and hunt for it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture . 
`` If the purse is n't found I 'll flog you , I 'll flog you all . '' 
Rostov , his eyes avoiding Denisov , began buttoning his coat , buckled on his saber , and put on his cap . 
`` I must have that purse , I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall . 
`` Denisov , let him alone , I know who has taken it , '' said Rostov , going toward the door without raising his eyes . 
Denisov paused , thought a moment , and , evidently understanding what Rostov hinted at , seized his arm . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he cried , and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords . 
`` You are mad , I tell you . 
I wo n't allow it . 
The purse is here ! 
I 'll flay this scoundwel alive , and it will be found . '' 
`` I know who has taken it , '' repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice , and went to the door . 
`` And I tell you , do n't you dahe to do it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , rushing at the cadet to restrain him . 
But Rostov pulled away his arm and , with as much anger as though Denisov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face . 
`` Do you understand what you 're saying ? '' 
he said in a trembling voice .
