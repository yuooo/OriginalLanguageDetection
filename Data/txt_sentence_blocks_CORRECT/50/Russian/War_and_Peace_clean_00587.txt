More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than anywhere else . 
Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others . 
For leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel . 
`` Eh , Makeev ! 
What has become of you , you son of a bitch ? 
Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you ? 
Fetch some more wood ! '' 
shouted a red-haired and red-faced man , screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire . 
`` And you , Jackdaw , go and fetch some wood ! '' 
said he to another soldier . 
This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal , but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself . 
The soldier they called `` Jackdaw , '' a thin little fellow with a sharp nose , rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender , handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood . 
`` Bring it here -- that 's fine ! '' 
They split up the wood , pressed it down on the fire , blew at it with their mouths , and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats , making the flames hiss and crackle . 
The men drew nearer and lit their pipes . 
The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood , setting his arms akimbo , began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood . 
`` Mother ! 
The dew is cold but clear ... . 
It 's well that I 'm a musketeer ... '' he sang , pretending to hiccough after each syllable . 
`` Look out , your soles will fly off ! '' 
shouted the red-haired man , noticing that the sole of the dancer 's boot was hanging loose . 
`` What a fellow you are for dancing ! '' 
The dancer stopped , pulled off the loose piece of leather , and threw it on the fire . 
`` Right enough , friend , '' said he , and , having sat down , took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth , and wrapped it round his foot . 
`` It 's the steam that spoils them , '' he added , stretching out his feet toward the fire . 
`` They 'll soon be issuing us new ones . 
They say that when we 've finished hammering them , we 're to receive double kits ! '' 
`` And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all , it seems , '' said one sergeant major . 
`` I 've had an eye on him this long while , '' said the other . 
`` Well , he 's a poor sort of soldier ... '' `` But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday . '' 
`` Yes , it 's all very well , but when a man 's feet are frozen how can he walk ? '' 
`` Eh ? 
Do n't talk nonsense ! '' 
said a sergeant major . 
`` Do you want to be doing the same ? '' 
said an old soldier , turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet . 
`` Well , you know , '' said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice , raising himself at the other side of the fire , `` a plump man gets thin , but for a thin one it 's death . 
Take me , now ! 
I 've got no strength left , '' he added , with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major . 
`` Tell them to send me to hospital ; I 'm aching all over ; anyway I sha n't be able to keep up . '' 
`` That 'll do , that 'll do ! '' 
replied the sergeant major quietly . 
The soldier said no more and the talk went on . 
`` What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today , and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on , '' said a soldier , starting a new theme . 
`` They were no more than make-believes . '' 
`` The Cossacks have taken their boots . 
They were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out . 
It was pitiful to see them , boys , '' put in the dancer . 
`` As they turned them over one seemed still alive and , would you believe it , he jabbered something in their lingo . '' 
`` But they 're a clean folk , lads , '' the first man went on ; `` he was white -- as white as birchbark -- and some of them are such fine fellows , you might think they were nobles . ''
