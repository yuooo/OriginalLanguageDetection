But still you might have added , ` He is n't a thief though . 
Here is your three thousand ; he sends it back . 
Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna . 
But he told me to say `` he sends his compliments . '' 
But , as it is , she will ask , ` But where is the money ? ' '' 
`` Mitya , you are unhappy , yes ! 
But not as unhappy as you think . 
Do n't worry yourself to death with despair . '' 
`` What , do you suppose I 'd shoot myself because I ca n't get three thousand to pay back ? 
That 's just it . 
I sha n't shoot myself . 
I have n't the strength now . 
Afterwards , perhaps . 
But now I 'm going to Grushenka . 
I do n't care what happens . '' 
`` And what then ? '' 
`` I 'll be her husband if she deigns to have me , and when lovers come , I 'll go into the next room . 
I 'll clean her friends ' goloshes , blow up their samovar , run their errands . '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all , '' Alyosha said solemnly . 
`` She 'll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive . 
She has a lofty mind , and no one could be more unhappy than you . 
She 'll see that for herself . '' 
`` She wo n't forgive everything , '' said Dmitri , with a grin . 
`` There 's something in it , brother , that no woman could forgive . 
Do you know what would be the best thing to do ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Pay back the three thousand . '' 
`` Where can we get it from ? 
I say , I have two thousand . 
Ivan will give you another thousand - that makes three . 
Take it and pay it back . '' 
`` And when would you get it , your three thousand ? 
You 're not of age , besides , and you must - you absolutely must - take my farewell to her to-day , with the money or without it , for I ca n't drag on any longer , things have come to such a pass . 
To-morrow is too late . 
I shall send you to father . '' 
`` To father ? '' 
`` Yes , to father first . 
Ask him for three thousand . '' 
`` But , Mitya , he wo n't give it . '' 
`` As though he would ! 
I know he wo n't . 
Do you know the meaning of despair , Alexey ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Listen . 
Legally he owes me nothing . 
I 've had it all from him , I know that . 
But morally he owes me something , does n't he ? 
You know he started with twenty-eight thousand of my mother 's money and made a hundred thousand with it . 
Let him give me back only three out of the twenty-eight thousand , and he 'll draw my soul out of hell , and it will atone for many of his sins . 
For that three thousand - I give you my solemn word - I 'll make an end of everything , and he shall hear nothing more of me .
