Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking smile . 
`` What if I wo n't tell you ? 
From whom could you find out ? 
No one knew about the signals except my father , Smerdyakov , and me : that was all . 
Heaven knew , too , but it wo n't tell you . 
But it 's an interesting fact . 
There 's no knowing what you might build on it . 
Ha ha ! 
Take comfort , gentlemen , I 'll reveal it . 
You 've some foolish idea in your hearts . 
You do n't know the man you have to deal with ! 
You have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence against himself , to his own damage ! 
Yes , for I 'm a man of honour and you - are not . '' 
The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur . 
He was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact . 
Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov . 
He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant , tapped the signals on the table , and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed he , Mitya , had tapped the signal `` Grushenka has come , '' when he tapped to his father , he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal , that `` Grushenka had come . '' 
`` So now you can build up your tower , '' Mitya broke off , and again turned away from them contemptuously . 
`` So no one knew of the signals but your dead father , you , and the valet Smerdyakov ? 
And no one else ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more . 
`` Yes . 
The valet Smerdyakov , and Heaven . 
Write down about Heaven . 
That may be of use . 
Besides , you will need God yourselves . '' 
And they had already of course , begun writing it down . 
But while they wrote , the prosecutor said suddenly , as though pitching on a new idea : `` But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all responsibility for the death of your father , was it not he , perhaps , who knocked the signal agreed upon , induced your father to open to him , and then ... committed the crime ? '' 
Mitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred . 
His silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink . 
`` You 've caught the fox again , '' commented Mitya at last ; `` you 've got the beast by the tail . 
Ha ha ! 
I see through you , Mr. Prosecutor . 
You thought , of course , that I should jump at that , catch at your prompting , and shout with all my might , ` Aie ! 
it 's Smerdyakov ; he 's the murderer . ' 
Confess that 's what you thought . 
Confess , and I 'll go on . '' 
But the prosecutor did not confess . 
He held his tongue and waited . 
`` You 're mistaken . 
I 'm not going to shout , ` It 's Smerdyakov , ' '' said Mitya . 
`` And you do n't even suspect him ? '' 
`` Why , do you suspect him ? '' 
`` He is suspected , too . '' 
Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor . 
`` Joking apart , '' he brought out gloomily . 
`` Listen . 
From the very beginning , almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain , I 've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind . 
I 've been sitting here , shouting that I 'm innocent and thinking all the time ` Smerdyakov ! ' 
I ca n't get Smerdyakov out of my head .
