`` This is a mortal insult ! '' 
The little Pole turned as red as a crab , and he went out of the room , briskly , as though unwilling to hear another word . 
Vrublevsky swung out after him , and Mitya followed , confused and crestfallen . 
He was afraid of Grushenka , afraid that the Pan would at once raise an outcry . 
And so indeed he did . 
The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka . 
`` Pani Agrippina , I have received a mortal insult ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience , as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot . 
`` Speak Russian ! 
Speak Russian ! '' 
she cried , `` not another word of Polish ! 
You used to talk Russian . 
You ca n't have forgotten it in five years . '' 
She was red with passion . 
`` Pani Agrippina - '' `` My name 's Agrafena , Grushenka , speak Russian or I wo n't listen ! '' 
The Pole gasped with offended dignity , and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian : `` Pani Agrafena , I came here to forget the past and forgive it , to forget all that has happened till to-day - '' `` Forgive ? 
Came here to forgive me ? '' 
Grushenka cut him short , jumping up from her seat . 
`` Just so , Pani , I 'm not pusillanimous , I 'm magnanimous . 
But I was astounded when I saw your lovers . 
Pan Mitya offered me three thousand , in the other room to depart . 
I spat in the pan 's face . '' 
`` What ? 
He offered you money for me ? '' 
cried Grushenka , hysterically . 
`` Is it true , Mitya ? 
How dare you ? 
Am I for sale ? '' 
`` Panie , panie ! '' 
yelled Mitya , `` she 's pure and shining , and I have never been her lover ! 
That 's a lie ... '' `` How dare you defend me to him ? '' 
shrieked Grushenka . 
`` It was n't virtue kept me pure , and it was n't that I was afraid of Kuzma , but that I might hold up my head when I met him , and tell him he 's a scoundrel . 
And he did actually refuse the money ? '' 
`` He took it ! 
He took it ! '' 
cried Mitya ; `` only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once , and I could only give him seven hundred straight off . '' 
`` I see : he heard I had money , and came here to marry me ! '' 
`` Pani Agrippina ! '' 
cried the little Pole . 
`` I 'm - a knight , I 'm - a nobleman , and not a lajdak . 
I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman , perverse and shameless . '' 
`` Oh , go back where you came from ! 
I 'll tell them to turn you out and you 'll be turned out , '' cried Grushenka , furious . 
`` I 've been a fool , a fool , to have been miserable these five years ! 
And it was n't for his sake , it was my anger made me miserable . 
And this is n't he at all ! 
Was he like this ? 
It might be his father !
