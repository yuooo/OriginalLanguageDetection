`` N-no , SiciIy is not the place for the family , the family should go to Caucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus , and your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her rheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist Lepelletier ; I could give you a note to him , and then ... there might be a change - '' `` Doctor , doctor ! 
But you see ! '' 
The captain flung wide his hands again despairingly , indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage . 
`` Well , that 's not my business , '' grinned the doctor . 
`` I have only told you the answer of medical science to your question as to possible `` Do n't be afraid , apothecary , my dog wo n't bite you , '' Kolya rapped out loudly , noticing the doctor 's rather uneasy glance at Perezvon , who was standing in the doorway . 
There was a wrathful note in Kolya 's voice . 
He used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose , and , as he explained afterwards , used it `` to insult him . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
The doctor flung up his head , staring with surprise at Kolya . 
`` Who 's this ? '' 
he addressed Alyosha , as though asking him to explain . 
`` It 's Perezvon 's master , do n't worry about me , '' Kolya said incisively again . 
`` Perezvon ? '' 
* repeated the doctor , perplexed . 
* i.e. a chime of bells . 
`` He hears the bell , but where it is he can not tell . 
Good-bye , we shall meet in Syracuse . '' 
`` Who 's this ? 
Who 's this ? '' 
The doctor flew into a terrible rage . 
`` He is a schoolboy , doctor , he is a mischievous boy ; take no notice of him , '' said Alyosha , frowning and speaking quickly . 
`` Kolya , hold your tongue ! '' 
he cried to Krassotkin . 
`` Take no notice of him , doctor , '' he repeated , rather impatiently . 
`` He wants a thrashing , a good thrashing ! '' 
The doctor stamped in a perfect fury . 
`` And you know , apothecary , my Perezvon might bite ! '' 
said Kolya , turning pale , with quivering voice and flashing eyes . 
`` Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Kolya , if you say another word , I 'll have nothing more to do with you , '' Alyosha cried peremptorily . 
`` There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin - this is the man , '' Kolya pointed to Alyosha . 
`` I obey him , good-bye ! '' 
He stepped forward , opened the door , and quickly went into the inner room . 
Perezvon flew after him . 
The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement , looking at Alyosha ; then , with a curse , he went out quickly to the carriage , repeating aloud , `` This is ... this is ... I do n't know what it is ! '' 
The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage . 
Alyosha followed Kolya into the room . 
He was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his father . 
A minute later the captain , too , came back . 
`` Father , father , come ... we ... '' Ilusha faltered in violent excitement , but apparently unable to go on , he flung his wasted arms , found his father and Kolya , uniting them in one embrace , and hugging them as tightly as he could . 
The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs , and Kolya 's lips and chin twitched . 
`` Father , father ! 
How sorry I am for you ! '' 
Ilusha moaned bitterly . 
`` Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we shall be happy ... the doctor ... '' the captain began . 
`` Ah , father ! 
I know what the new doctor said to you about me ... . 
I saw ! '' 
cried Ilusha , and again he hugged them both with all his strength , hiding his face on his father 's shoulder .
