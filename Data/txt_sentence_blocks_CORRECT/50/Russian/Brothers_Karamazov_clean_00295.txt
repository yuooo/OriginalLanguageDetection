Do n't you want to write it down ? '' 
said Mitya , with a distorted smile . 
`` No ; no need to write it down . 
But still you do have curious dreams . '' 
`` It 's not a question of dreams now , gentlemen - this is realism , this is real life ! 
I 'm a wolf and you 're the hunters . 
Well , hunt him down ! '' 
`` You are wrong to make such comparisons . '' 
began Nikolay Parfenovitch , with extraordinary softness . 
`` No , I 'm not wrong , at all ! '' 
Mitya flared up again , though his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart . 
He grew more good humoured at every word . 
`` You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions , but an honourable man , the honourable impulses of the heart -LRB- I say that boldly ! -RRB- 
- no ! 
That you must believe you have no right indeed ... but - Be silent , heart , Be patient , humble , hold thy peace . 
Well , shall I go on ? '' 
he broke off gloomily . 
`` If you 'll be so kind , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
The Third Ordeal THOUGH Mitya spoke sullenly , it was evident that he was trying more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story . 
He told them how he had leapt over the fence into his father 's garden ; how he had gone up to the window ; told them all that had passed under the window . 
Clearly , precisely , distinctly , he described the feelings that troubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was with his father or not . 
But , strange to say , both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve , looked coldly at him , asked few questions . 
Mitya could gather nothing from their faces . 
`` They 're angry and offended , '' he thought . 
`` Well , bother them ! '' 
When he described how he made up his mind at last to make the `` signal '' to his father that Grushenka had come , so that he should open the window , the lawyers paid no attention to the word `` signal , '' as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection : so much so , that Mitya noticed it . 
Coming at last to the moment when , seeing his father peering out of the window , his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket , he suddenly , as though of design , stopped short . 
He sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon him . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the investigating lawyer . 
`` You pulled out the weapon and ... and what happened then ? 
`` Then ? 
Why , then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his skull ... . 
I suppose that 's your story . 
That 's it ! '' 
His eyes suddenly flashed . 
All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul . 
`` Our story ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Mitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent . 
`` My story , gentlemen ? 
Well , was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was like this , '' he began softly . 
`` Whether it was someone 's tears , or my mother prayed to God , or a good angel kissed me at that instant , I do n't know . 
But the devil was conquered . 
I rushed from the window and ran to the fence . 
My father was alarmed and , for the first time , he saw me then , cried out , and sprang back from the window . 
I remember that very well . 
I ran across the garden to the fence ... and there Grigory caught me , when I was sitting on the fence . '' 
At that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners .
