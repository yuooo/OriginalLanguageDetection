And then I shall be left alone ... . 
I shall come to you , Lise ... . 
For the future we will be together . '' 
`` Yes , together , together ! 
Henceforward we shall be always together , all our lives ! 
Listen , kiss me , I allow you . '' 
Alyosha kissed her . 
`` Come , now go . 
Christ be with you ! '' 
and she made the sign of the cross over him . 
`` Make haste back to him while he is alive . 
I see I 've kept you cruelly . 
I 'll pray to-day for him and you . 
Alyosha , we shall be happy ! 
Shall we be happy , shall we ? '' 
`` I believe we shall , Lise . '' 
Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good-bye to her . 
But no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him . 
From the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , this is awful . 
This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous . 
I trust you wo n't dream - It 's foolishness , nothing but foolishness ! '' 
she said , attacking him at once . 
`` Only do n't tell her that , '' said Alyosha , `` or she will be upset , and that 's bad for her now . '' 
`` Sensible advice from a sensible young man . 
Am I to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state , because you did n't want to irritate her by contradiction ? '' 
`` Oh no , not at all . 
I was quite serious in what I said , '' Alyosha declared stoutly . 
`` To be serious about it is impossible , unthinkable , and in the first place I shall never be at home to you again , and I shall take her away , you may be sure of that . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` It 's all so far off . 
We may have to wait another year and a half . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that 's true , of course , and you 'll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half . 
But I am so unhappy ! 
Though it 's such nonsense , it 's a great blow to me . 
I feel like Famusov in the last scene of Sorrow from Wit . 
You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya , and , only fancy , I 've run down to meet you on the stairs , and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase . 
I heard it all ; I almost dropped . 
So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late ! 
It means love to the daughter but death to the mother . 
I might as well be in my grave at once . 
And a more serious matter still , what is this letter she has written ? 
Show it me at once , at once ! '' 
`` No , there 's no need . 
Tell me , how is Katerina Ivanovna now ? 
I must know . '' 
`` She still lies in delirium ; she has not regained consciousness . 
Her aunts are here ; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs . 
Herzenstube came , and he was so alarmed that I did n't know what to do for him .
