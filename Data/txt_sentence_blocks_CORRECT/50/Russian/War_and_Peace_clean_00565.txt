He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman 's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head . 
He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room , and without greeting anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand . 
Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport , of the message Petya had brought , and his own replies to both generals . 
Then he told him all he knew of the French detachment . 
`` That 's so . 
But we must know what troops they are and their numbers , '' said Dolokhov . 
`` It will be necessary to go there . 
We ca n't start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are . 
I like to work accurately . 
Here now -- would n't one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the French camp with me ? 
I have brought a spare uniform . '' 
`` I , I. . . 
I 'll go with you ! '' 
cried Petya . 
`` There 's no need for you to go at all , '' said Denisov , addressing Dolokhov , `` and as for him , I wo n't let him go on any account . '' 
`` I like that ! '' 
exclaimed Petya . 
`` Why should n't I go ? '' 
`` Because it 's useless . '' 
`` Well , you must excuse me , because ... because ... I shall go , and that 's all . 
You 'll take me , wo n't you ? '' 
he said , turning to Dolokhov . 
`` Why not ? '' 
Dolokhov answered absently , scrutinizing the face of the French drummer boy . 
`` Have you had that youngster with you long ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He was taken today but he knows nothing . 
I 'm keeping him with me . '' 
`` Yes , and where do you put the others ? '' 
inquired Dolokhov . 
`` Where ? 
I send them away and take a weceipt for them , '' shouted Denisov , suddenly flushing . 
`` And I say boldly that I have not a single man 's life on my conscience . 
Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort , instead of staining - I speak bluntly -- staining the honor of a soldier ? '' 
`` That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen , '' said Dolokhov with cold irony , `` but it 's time for you to drop it . '' 
`` Why , I 've not said anything ! 
I only say that I 'll certainly go with you , '' said Petya shyly . 
`` But for you and me , old fellow , it 's time to drop these amenities , '' continued Dolokhov , as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated Denisov . 
`` Now , why have you kept this lad ? '' 
he went on , swaying his head . 
`` Because you are sorry for him ! 
Do n't we know those ` receipts ' of yours ? 
You send a hundred men away , and thirty get there . 
The rest either starve or get killed . 
So is n't it all the same not to send them ? '' 
The esaul , screwing up his light-colored eyes , nodded approvingly . 
`` That 's not the point . 
I 'm not going to discuss the matter . 
I do not wish to take it on my conscience . 
You say they 'll die .
