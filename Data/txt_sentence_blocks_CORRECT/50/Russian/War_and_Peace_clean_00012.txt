There is a war now against Napoleon . 
If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army ; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right . '' 
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre 's childish words . 
He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense , but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question . 
`` If no one fought except on his own conviction , there would be no wars , '' he said . 
`` And that would be splendid , '' said Pierre . 
Prince Andrew smiled ironically . 
`` Very likely it would be splendid , but it will never come about ... '' `` Well , why are you going to the war ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` What for ? 
I do n't know . 
I must . 
Besides that I am going ... '' He paused . 
`` I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me ! '' 
The rustle of a woman 's dress was heard in the next room . 
Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up , and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pavlovna 's drawing room . 
Pierre removed his feet from the sofa . 
The princess came in . 
She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other . 
Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her . 
`` How is it , '' she began , as usual in French , settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair , `` how is it Annette never got married ? 
How stupid you men all are not to have married her ! 
Excuse me for saying so , but you have no sense about women . 
What an argumentative fellow you are , Monsieur Pierre ! '' 
`` And I am still arguing with your husband . 
I ca n't understand why he wants to go to the war , '' replied Pierre , addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women . 
The princess started . 
Evidently Pierre 's words touched her to the quick . 
`` Ah , that is just what I tell him ! '' 
said she . 
`` I do n't understand it ; I do n't in the least understand why men ca n't live without wars . 
How is it that we women do n't want anything of the kind , do n't need it ? 
Now you shall judge between us . 
I always tell him : Here he is Uncle 's aide-de-camp , a most brilliant position . 
He is so well known , so much appreciated by everyone . 
The other day at the Apraksins ' I heard a lady asking , ` Is that the famous Prince Andrew ? ' 
I did indeed . '' 
She laughed . 
`` He is so well received everywhere . 
He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor . 
You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously . 
Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it . 
What do you think ? '' 
Pierre looked at his friend and , noticing that he did not like the conversation , gave no reply . 
`` When are you starting ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Oh , do n't speak of his going , do n't ! 
I wo n't hear it spoken of , '' said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member . 
`` Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know , Andre ... '' -LRB- she looked significantly at her husband -RRB- `` I 'm afraid , I 'm afraid ! '' 
she whispered , and a shudder ran down her back .
