And the lady must be the daughter of the house here , who has come from Moscow , the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes to Marfa for soup . '' 
`` I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds , if they rhyme , '' the woman 's voice continued . 
`` Why do n't you go on ? '' 
The man sang again : What do I care for royal wealth If but my dear one be in health ? 
Lord have mercy On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
`` It was even better last time , '' observed the woman 's voice . 
`` You sang ` If my darling be in health ' ; it sounded more tender . 
I suppose you 've forgotten to-day . '' 
`` Poetry is rubbish ! '' 
said Smerdyakov curtly . 
`` Oh , no ! 
I am very fond of poetry . '' 
`` So far as it 's poetry , it 's essential rubbish . 
Consider yourself , who ever talks in rhyme ? 
And if we were all to talk in rhyme , even though it were decreed by government , we should n't say much , should we ? 
Poetry is no good , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` How clever you are ! 
How is it you 've gone so deep into everything ? '' 
The woman 's voice was more and more insinuating . 
`` I could have done better than that . 
I could have known more than that , if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up . 
I would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father . 
And they used to throw it in my teeth in Moscow . 
It had reached them from here , thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch . 
Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth , but I would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the world at all . 
They used to say in the market , and your mamma too , with great lack of delicacy , set off telling me that her hair was like a mat on her head , and that she was short of five foot by a wee bit . 
Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said ' a little bit , ' like everyone else ? 
She wanted to make it touching , a regular peasant 's feeling . 
Can a Russian peasant be said to feel , in comparison with an educated man ? 
He ca n't be said to have feeling at all , in his ignorance . 
From my childhood up when I hear ' a wee bit , ' I am ready to burst with rage . 
I hate all Russia , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` If you 'd been a cadet in the army , or a young hussar , you would n't have talked like that , but would have drawn your sabre to defend all Russia . '' 
`` I do n't want to be a hussar , Marya Kondratyevna , and , what 's more , I should like to abolish all soldiers . '' 
`` And when an enemy comes , who is going to defend us ? '' 
`` There 's no need of defence . 
In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia by Napoleon , first Emperor of the French , father of the present one , and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us . 
A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it . 
We should have had quite different institutions . '' 
`` Are they so much better in their own country than we are ? 
I would n't change a dandy I know of for three young englishmen , '' observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly , doubtless accompanying her words with a most languishing glance . 
`` That 's as one prefers . '' 
`` But you are just like a foreigner - just like a most gentlemanly foreigner . 
I tell you that , though it makes me bashful . '' 
`` If you care to know , the folks there and ours here are just alike in their vice . 
They are swindlers , only there the scoundrel wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it . 
The Russian people want thrashing , as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday , though he is mad , and all his children . '' 
`` You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch . ''
