`` We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet examined . 
Do n't be anxious about your money . 
It will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning ... if it appears , or , so to speak , is proved that you have undisputed right to it . 
Well , and now ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up , and informed Mitya firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search `` of your clothes and everything else ... '' `` By all means , gentlemen . 
I 'll turn out all my pockets , if you like . '' 
And he did , in fact , begin turning out his pockets . 
`` It will be necessary to take off your clothes , too . '' 
`` What ! 
Undress ? 
Ugh ! 
Damn it ! 
Wo n't you search me as I am ? 
Ca n't you ? '' 
`` It 's utterly impossible , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You must take off your clothes . '' 
`` As you like , '' Mitya submitted gloomily ; `` only , please , not here , but behind the curtains . 
Who will search them ? '' 
`` Behind the curtains , of course . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent . 
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity . 
The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny . 
`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya . 
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers . 
There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes . 
`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? ''
