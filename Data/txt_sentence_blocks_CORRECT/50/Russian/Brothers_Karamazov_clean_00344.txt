He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters . 
He is not allowed to go about with me now , no one is allowed to go about with me now . 
Smurov is not allowed to either ; I 've got a bad name with everyone . 
They say I 'm a ` desperate character , ' '' Kolya smiled scornfully . 
`` It all began from what happened on the railway . '' 
`` Ah , we 've heard of that exploit of yours , too , '' cried the captain . 
`` How could you lie still on the line ? 
Is it possible you were n't the least afraid , lying there under the train ? 
Were n't you frightened ? '' 
The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya . 
`` N - not particularly , '' answered Kolya carelessly . 
`` What 's blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose , '' he said , turning again to Ilusha - but though he assumed an unconcerned air as he talked , he still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up . 
`` Ah ! 
I heard about the goose ! '' 
Ilusha laughed , beaming all over . 
`` They told me , but I did n't understand . 
Did they really take you to the court ? '' 
`` The most stupid , trivial affair , they made a mountain of a mole-hill as they always do , '' Kolya began carelessly . 
`` I was walking through the market-place here one day , just when they 'd driven in the geese . 
I stopped and looked at them . 
All at once a fellow , who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov 's now , looked at me and said , ` What are you looking at the geese for ? ' 
I looked at him ; he was a stupid , moon-faced fellow of twenty . 
I am always on the side of the peasantry , you know . 
I like talking to the peasants ... . 
We 've dropped behind the peasants that 's an axiom . 
I believe you are laughing , Karamazov ? '' 
`` No , Heaven forbid , I am listening , '' said Alyosha with a most good-natured air , and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured . '' 
`` My theory , Karamazov , is clear and simple , '' he hurried on again , looking pleased . 
`` I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their due , but I am not for spoiling them , that is a sine qua non ... But I was telling you about the goose . 
So I turned to the fool and answered , ' I am wondering what the goose thinks about . ' 
He looked at me quite stupidly , ` And what does the goose think about ? ' 
he asked . 
` Do you see that cart full of oats ? ' 
I said . 
` The oats are dropping out of the sack , and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up - do you see ? ' ' 
I see that quite well , ' he said . 
` Well , ' said I , ` if that cart were to move on a little , would it break the goose 's neck or not ? ' 
` It 'd be sure to break it , ' and he grinned all over his face , highly delighted . 
` Come on , then , ' said I , ` let 's try . ' 
` Let 's , ' he said . 
And it did not take us long to arrange : he stood at the bridle without being noticed , and I stood on one side to direct the goose . 
And the owner was n't looking , he was talking to someone , so I had nothing to do , the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself , under the cart , just under the wheel . 
I winked at the lad , he tugged at the bridle , and crack . 
The goose 's neck was broken in half . 
And , as luck would have it , all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once . 
` You did that on purpose ! ' 
` No , not on purpose . ' 
` Yes , you did , on purpose ! ' 
Well , they shouted , ` Take him to the justice of the peace ! ' 
They took me , too .
