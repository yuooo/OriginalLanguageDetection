Ah , what silliness ! 
And how bored I am ! '' 
She waved her hand with a look of repulsion . 
`` It 's your luxurious life , '' said Alyosha , softly '' `` Is it better , then , to be poor ? '' 
`` Yes , it is better . '' 
`` That 's what your monk taught you . 
That 's not true . 
Let me be rich and all the rest poor , I 'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to anyone else . 
Ach , do n't speak , do n't say anything '' ; she shook her hand at him , though Alyosha had not opened his mouth . 
`` You 've told me all that before , I know it all by heart . 
It bores me . 
If I am ever poor , I shall murder somebody , and even if I am rich , I may murder someone , perhaps - why do nothing ! 
But do you know , I should like to reap , cut the rye ? 
I 'll marry you , and you shall become a peasant , a real peasant ; we 'll keep a colt , shall we ? 
Do you know Kalganov ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` He is always wandering about , dreaming . 
He says , ` Why live in real life ? 
It 's better to dream . 
One can dream the most delightful things , but real life is a bore . ' 
But he 'll be married soon for all that ; he 's been making love to me already . 
Can you spin tops ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , he 's just like a top : he wants to be wound up and set spinning and then to be lashed , lashed , lashed with a whip . 
If I marry him , I 'll keep him spinning all his life . 
You are not ashamed to be with me ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` You are awfully cross , because I do n't talk about holy things . 
I do n't want to be holy . 
What will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin ? 
You must know all about that . '' 
`` God will censure you . '' 
Alyosha was watching her steadily . 
`` That 's just what I should like . 
I would go up and they would censure me , and I would burst out laughing in their faces . 
I should dreadfully like to set fire to the house , Alyosha , to our house ; you still do n't believe me ? '' 
`` Why ? 
There are children of twelve years old , who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire , too . 
It 's a sort of disease . '' 
`` That 's not true , that 's not true ; there may be children , but that 's not what I mean . '' 
`` You take evil for good ; it 's a passing crisis ; it 's the result of your illness , perhaps . '' 
`` You do despise me , though ! 
It 's simply that I do n't want to do good , I want to do evil , and it has nothing to do with illness . '' 
`` Why do evil ? '' 
`` So that everything might be destroyed . 
Ah , how nice it would be if everything were destroyed ! 
You know , Alyosha , I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad , and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it out . 
Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all . 
That would be awfully nice . 
Why would it be so nice , Alyosha ? ''
