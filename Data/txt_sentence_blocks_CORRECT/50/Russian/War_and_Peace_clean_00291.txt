thought she , as she went slowly along the passage . 
`` Nastasya Ivanovna , what sort of children shall I have ? '' 
she asked the buffoon , who was coming toward her in a woman 's jacket . 
`` Why , fleas , crickets , grasshoppers , '' answered the buffoon . 
`` O Lord , O Lord , it 's always the same ! 
Oh , where am I to go ? 
What am I to do with myself ? '' 
And tapping with her heels , she ran quickly upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story . 
Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table , on which were plates of raisins , walnuts , and almonds . 
The governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa . 
Natasha sat down , listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air , and then got up again . 
`` The island of Madagascar , '' she said , `` Ma-da-gas-car , '' she repeated , articulating each syllable distinctly , and , not replying to Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying , she went out of the room . 
Her brother Petya was upstairs too ; with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night . 
`` Petya ! 
Petya ! '' 
she called to him . 
`` Carry me downstairs . '' 
Petya ran up and offered her his back . 
She jumped on it , putting her arms round his neck , and he pranced along with her . 
`` No , do n't ... the island of Madagascar ! '' 
she said , and jumping off his back she went downstairs . 
Having as it were reviewed her kingdom , tested her power , and made sure that everyone was submissive , but that all the same it was dull , Natasha betook herself to the ballroom , picked up her guitar , sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase , and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass , picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew . 
What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners , but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds . 
She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered . 
She was in a mood for brooding on the past . 
Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand . 
Natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door , and it seemed to her that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand . 
`` Yes it was exactly the same , '' thought Natasha . 
`` Sonya , what is this ? '' 
she cried , twanging a thick string . 
`` Oh , you are there ! '' 
said Sonya with a start , and came near and listened . 
`` I do n't know . 
A storm ? '' 
she ventured timidly , afraid of being wrong . 
`` There ! 
That 's just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before , '' thought Natasha , `` and in just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her . '' 
`` No , it 's the chorus from The Water-Carrier , listen ! '' 
and Natasha sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it . 
`` Where were you going ? '' 
she asked . 
`` To change the water in this glass . 
I am just finishing the design . '' 
`` You always find something to do , but I ca n't , '' said Natasha . 
`` And where 's Nicholas ? '' 
`` Asleep , I think . '' 
`` Sonya , go and wake him , '' said Natasha . 
`` Tell him I want him to come and sing . '' 
She sat awhile , wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could be , and without solving this problem , or at all regretting not having done so , she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover 's eyes . 
`` Oh , if only he would come quicker !
