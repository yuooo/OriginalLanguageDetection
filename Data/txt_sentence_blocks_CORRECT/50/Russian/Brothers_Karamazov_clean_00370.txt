`` I do n't know . 
It 's a craving to destroy something good or , as you say , to set fire to something . 
It happens sometimes . '' 
`` I not only say it , I shall do it . '' 
`` I believe you . '' 
`` Ah , how I love you for saying you believe me . 
And you are not lying one little bit . 
But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to annoy you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it , too . '' 
`` There is a little . 
I never can tell lies to you , '' she declared , with a strange fire in her eyes . 
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness . 
There was not a trace of humour or jesting in her face now , though , in old days , fun and gaiety never deserted her even at her most `` earnest '' moments . 
`` There are moments when people love crime , '' said Alyosha thoughtfully . 
`` Yes , yes ! 
You have uttered my thought ; they love crime , everyone loves crime , they love it always , not at some ` moments . ' 
You know , it 's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since . 
They all declare that they hate evil , but secretly they all love it . '' 
`` And are you still reading nasty books ? '' 
`` Yes , I am . 
Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal them . '' 
`` Are n't you ashamed to destroy yourself ? '' 
`` I want to destroy myself . 
There 's a boy here , who lay down between the railway lines when the train was passing . 
Lucky fellow ! 
Listen , your brother is being tried now for murdering his father and everyone loves his having killed his father . '' 
`` Loves his having killed his father ? '' 
`` Yes , loves it ; everyone loves it ! 
Everybody says it 's so awful , but secretly they simply love it . 
I for one love it . '' 
`` There is some truth in what you say about everyone , '' said Alyosha softly . 
`` Oh , what ideas you have ! '' 
Lise shrieked in delight . 
`` And you a monk , too ! 
You would n't believe how I respect you , Alyosha , for never telling lies . 
Oh , I must tell you a funny dream of mine . 
I sometimes dream of devils . 
It 's night ; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place , in all the corners , under the table , and they open the doors ; there 's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me . 
And they are just coming , just seizing me . 
But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back , though they do n't go away altogether , they stand at the doors and in the corners , waiting . 
And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud , and so I begin , and then they come crowding back to me , delighted , and seize me again and I cross myself again and they all draw back . 
It 's awful fun , it takes one 's breath away . '' 
`` I 've had the same dream , too , '' said Alyosha suddenly . 
`` Really ? '' 
cried Lise , surprised . 
`` I say , Alyosha , do n't laugh , that 's awfully important . 
Could two different people have the same dream ? '' 
`` It seems they can . '' 
`` Alyosha , I tell you , it 's awfully important , '' Lise went on , with really excessive amazement . 
`` It 's not the dream that 's important , but your having the same dream as me .
