But , strange to say , Fyodor Pavlovitch , who had been so gay , suddenly began frowning . 
He frowned and gulped brandy , and it was already a glass too much . 
`` Get along with you , Jesuits ! '' 
he cried to the servants . 
`` Go away , Smerdyakov . 
I 'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day , but be off ! 
Do n't cry , Grigory . 
Go to Marfa . 
She 'll comfort you and put you to bed . 
The rascals wo n't let us sit in peace after dinner , '' he snapped peevishly , as the servants promptly withdrew at his word . 
`` Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now , after dinner . 
It 's you he 's so interested in . 
What have you done to fascinate him ? '' 
he added to Ivan . 
`` Nothing whatever , '' answered Ivan . 
`` He 's pleased to have a high opinion of me ; he 's a lackey and a mean soul . 
Raw material for revolution , however , when the time comes . '' 
`` There will be others and better ones . 
But there will be some like him as well . 
His kind will come first , and better ones after . '' 
`` And when will the time come ? '' 
`` The rocket will go off and fizzle out , perhaps . 
The peasants are not very fond of listening to these soup-makers , so far . '' 
`` Ah , brother , but a Balaam 's ass like that thinks and thinks , and the devil knows where he gets to . '' 
`` He 's storing up ideas , '' said Ivan , smiling . 
`` You see , I know he ca n't bear me , nor anyone else , even you , though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you . 
Worse still with Alyosha , he despises Alyosha . 
But he does n't steal , that 's one thing , and he 's not a gossip , he holds his tongue , and does n't wash our dirty linen in public . 
He makes capital fish pasties too . 
But , damn him , is he worth talking about so much ? '' 
`` Of course he is n't . '' 
`` And as for the ideas he may be hatching , the Russian peasant , generally speaking , needs thrashing . 
That I 've always maintained . 
Our peasants are swindlers , and do n't deserve to be pitied , and it 's a good thing they 're still flogged sometimes . 
Russia is rich in birches . 
If they destroyed the forests , it would be the ruin of Russia . 
I stand up for the clever people . 
We 've left off thrashing the peasants , we 've grown so clever , but they go on thrashing themselves . 
And a good thing too . 
` For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again , ' or how does it go ? 
Anyhow , it will be measured . 
But Russia 's all swinishness . 
My dear , if you only knew how I hate Russia ... . 
That is , not Russia , but all this vice ! 
But maybe I mean Russia . 
Tout cela c'est de la cochonnerie ... * Do you know what I like ? 
I like wit . '' 
* All this is filthiness . 
`` You 've had another glass . 
That 's enough . ''
