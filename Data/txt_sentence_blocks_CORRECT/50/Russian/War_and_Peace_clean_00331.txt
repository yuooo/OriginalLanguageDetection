Now , do me a service ... . 
What horses have you come with ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` As your messenger ordered , your special beasts , '' replied Balaga . 
`` Well , listen , Balaga ! 
Drive all three to death but get me there in three hours . 
Eh ? '' 
`` When they are dead , what shall I drive ? '' 
said Balaga with a wink . 
`` Mind , I 'll smash your face in ! 
Do n't make jokes ! '' 
cried Anatole , suddenly rolling his eyes . 
`` Why joke ? '' 
said the driver , laughing . 
`` As if I 'd grudge my gentlemen anything ! 
As fast as ever the horses can gallop , so fast we 'll go ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Well , sit down . '' 
`` Yes , sit down ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
`` I 'll stand , Theodore Ivanych . '' 
`` Sit down ; nonsense ! 
Have a drink ! '' 
said Anatole , and filled a large glass of Madeira for him . 
The driver 's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine . 
After refusing it for manners ' sake , he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap . 
`` And when are we to start , your excellency ? '' 
`` Well ... '' Anatole looked at his watch . 
`` We 'll start at once . 
Mind , Balaga ! 
You 'll get there in time ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` That depends on our luck in starting , else why should n't we be there in time ? '' 
replied Balaga . 
`` Did n't we get you to Tver in seven hours ? 
I think you remember that , your excellency ? '' 
`` Do you know , one Christmas I drove from Tver , '' said Anatole , smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed rapturously at him with wide-open eyes . 
`` Will you believe it , Makarka , it took one 's breath away , the rate we flew . 
We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them . 
Eh ? '' 
`` Those were horses ! '' 
Balaga continued the tale . 
`` That time I 'd harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts , '' he went on , turning to Dolokhov . 
`` Will you believe it , Theodore Ivanych , those animals flew forty miles ? 
I could n't hold them in , my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins -- ` Catch hold yourself , your excellency ! ' 
says I , and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there . 
It was n't a case of urging them on , there was no holding them in till we reached the place . 
The devils took us there in three hours ! 
Only the near one died of it . ''
