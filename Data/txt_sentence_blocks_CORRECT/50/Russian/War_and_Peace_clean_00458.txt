`` And who may you be ? '' 
one of them suddenly asked Pierre , evidently meaning what Pierre himself had in mind , namely : `` If you want to eat we 'll give you some food , only let us know whether you are an honest man . '' 
`` I , I. . . '' 
said Pierre , feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them . 
`` By rights I am a militia officer , but my men are not here . 
I came to the battle and have lost them . '' 
`` There now ! '' 
said one of the soldiers . 
Another shook his head . 
`` Would you like a little mash ? '' 
the first soldier asked , and handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean . 
Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash , as they called the food in the cauldron , and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted . 
As he sat bending greedily over it , helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another , his was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence . 
`` Where have you to go to ? 
Tell us ! '' 
said one of them . 
`` To Mozhaysk . '' 
`` You 're a gentleman , are n't you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And what 's your name ? '' 
`` Peter Kirilych . '' 
`` Well then , Peter Kirilych , come along with us , we 'll take you there . '' 
In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozhaysk . 
By the time they got near Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town , the cocks were already crowing . 
Pierre went on with the soldiers , quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it . 
He would not soon have remembered this , such was his state of forgetfulness , had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom , who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn . 
The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat . 
`` Your excellency ! '' 
he said . 
`` Why , we were beginning to despair ! 
How is it you are on foot ? 
And where are you going , please ? '' 
`` Oh , yes ! '' 
said Pierre . 
The soldiers stopped . 
`` So you 've found your folk ? '' 
said one of them . 
`` Well , good-by , Peter Kirilych -- is n't it ? '' 
`` Good-by , Peter Kirilych ! '' 
Pierre heard the other voices repeat . 
`` Good-by ! '' 
he said and turned with his groom toward the inn . 
`` I ought to give them something ! '' 
he thought , and felt in his pocket . 
`` No , better not ! '' 
said another , inner voice . 
There was not a room to be had at the inn , they were all occupied . 
Pierre went out into the yard and , covering himself up head and all , lay down in his carriage . 
Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep , but suddenly , almost with the distinctness of reality , he heard the boom , boom , boom of firing , the thud of projectiles , groans and cries , and smelled blood and powder , and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him . 
Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak .
