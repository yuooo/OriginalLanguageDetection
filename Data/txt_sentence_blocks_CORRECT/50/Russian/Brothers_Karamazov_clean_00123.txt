About my ` wisp of tow , ' then ? '' 
He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against Alyosha . 
His lips were strangely compressed like a thread . 
`` What wisp of tow ? '' 
muttered Alyosha . 
`` He is come to complain of me , father ! '' 
cried a voice familiar to Alyosha - the voice of the schoolboy - from behind the curtain . 
`` I bit his finger just now . '' 
The curtain was pulled , and Alyosha saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner under the ikons . 
The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt . 
He was evidently unwell , and , judging by his glittering eyes , he was in a fever . 
He looked at Alyosha without fear , as though he felt he was at home and could not be touched . 
`` What ! 
Did he bite your finger ? '' 
The captain jumped up from his chair . 
`` Was it your finger he bit ? '' 
`` Yes . 
He was throwing stones with other schoolboys . 
There were six of them against him alone . 
I went up to him , and he threw a stone at me and then another at my head . 
I asked him what I had done to him . 
And then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly , I do n't know why . '' 
`` I 'll thrash him , sir , at once - this minute ! '' 
The captain jumped up from his seat . 
`` But I am not complaining at all , I am simply telling you ... . 
I do n't want him to be thrashed . 
Besides , he seems to be ill . '' 
`` And do you suppose I 'd thrash him ? 
That I 'd take my Ilusha and thrash him before you for your satisfaction ? 
Would you like it done at once , sir ? '' 
said the captain , suddenly turning to Alyosha , as though he were going to attack him . 
`` I am sorry about your finger , sir ; but instead of thrashing Ilusha , would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath ? 
I should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance . 
You wo n't ask for the fifth one too ? '' 
He stopped short with a catch in his throat . 
Every feature in his face was twitching and working ; he looked extremely defiant . 
He was in a sort of frenzy . 
`` I think I understand it all now , '' said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully , still keeping his seat . 
`` So your boy is a good boy , he loves his father , and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant ... . 
Now I understand it , '' he repeated thoughtfully . 
`` But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his action , I know that , and if only it is possible for him to come to you , or better still , to meet you in that same place , he will ask your forgiveness before everyone - if you wish it . '' 
`` After pulling out my beard , you mean , he will ask my forgiveness ? 
And he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish , does n't he ? '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
On the contrary , he will do anything you like and in any way you like . '' 
`` So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in that very tavern - ` The Metropolis ' it 's called - or in the marketplace , he would do it ? '' 
`` Yes , he would even go down on his knees . '' 
`` You 've pierced me to the heart , sir . 
Touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart ! 
I am only too sensible of your brother 's generosity .
