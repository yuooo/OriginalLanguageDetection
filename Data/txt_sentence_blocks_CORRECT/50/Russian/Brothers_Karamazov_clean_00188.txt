One day he would come determined and say fervently : `` I know it will be heaven for me , heaven , the moment I confess . 
Fourteen years I 've been in hell . 
I want to suffer . 
I will take my punishment and begin to live . 
You can pass through the world doing wrong , but there 's no turning back . 
Now I dare not love my neighbour nor even my own children . 
Good God , my children will understand , perhaps , what my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me ! 
God is not in strength but in truth . '' 
`` All will understand your sacrifice , '' I said to him , `` if not at once , they will understand later ; for you have served truth , the higher truth , not of the earth . '' 
And he would go away seeming comforted , but next day he would come again , bitter , pale , sarcastic . 
`` Every time I come to you , you look at me so inquisitively as though to say , ` He has still not confessed ! ' 
Wait a bit , do n't despise me too much . 
It 's not such an easy thing to do as you would think . 
Perhaps I shall not do it at all . 
You wo n't go and inform against me then , will you ? '' 
And far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity , I was afraid to look at him at all . 
I was quite ill from anxiety , and my heart was full of tears . 
I could not sleep at night . 
`` I have just come from my wife , '' he went on . 
`` Do you understand what the word ` wife ' means ? 
When I went out , the children called to me , ` Good-bye , father , make haste back to read The Children 's Magazine with us . ' 
No , you do n't understand that ! 
No one is wise from another man 's woe . '' 
His eyes were glittering , his lips were twitching . 
Suddenly he struck the table with his fist so that everything on it danced - it was the first time he had done such a thing , he was such a mild man . 
`` But need I ? '' 
he exclaimed , `` must I ? 
No one has been condemned , no one has been sent to Siberia in my place , the man died of fever . 
And I 've been punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed . 
And I sha n't be believed , they wo n't believe my proofs . 
Need I confess , need I ? 
I am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I have shed , if only my wife and children may be spared . 
Will it be just to ruin them with me ? 
Are n't we making a mistake ? 
What is right in this case ? 
And will people recognise it , will they appreciate it , will they respect it ? '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
I thought to myself , `` he is thinking of other people 's respect at such a moment ! '' 
And I felt so sorry for him then , that I believe I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him . 
I saw he was beside himself . 
I was aghast , realising with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant . 
`` Decide my fate ! '' 
he exclaimed again . 
`` Go and confess , '' I whispered to him . 
My voice failed me , but I whispered it firmly . 
I took up the New Testament from the table , the Russian translation , and showed him the Gospel of St. John , chapter 12 , verse 24 : `` Verily , verily , I say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . '' 
I had just been reading that verse when he came in . 
He read it . 
`` That 's true , '' he said , he smiled bitterly . 
`` It 's terrible the things you find in those books , '' he said , after a pause .
