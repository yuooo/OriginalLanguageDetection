`` Only think , a dog ! '' 
Agafya observed sententiously . 
`` Why are you late , female ? '' 
asked Krassotkin sternly . 
`` Female , indeed ! 
Go on with you , you brat . '' 
`` Brat ? '' 
`` Yes , a brat . 
What is it to you if I 'm late ; if I 'm late , you may be sure I have good reason , '' muttered Agafya , busying herself about the stove , without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice . 
She seemed quite pleased , in fact , to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master . 
`` Listen , you frivolous young woman , '' Krassotkin began , getting up from the sofa , `` can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides , that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence ? 
I am going out . '' 
`` And what am I going to swear for ? '' 
laughed Agafya . 
`` I shall look after them without that . '' 
`` No , you must swear on your eternal salvation . 
Else I sha n't go . '' 
`` Well , do n't then . 
What does it matter to me ? 
It 's cold out ; stay at home . '' 
`` Kids , '' Kolya turned to the children , `` this woman will stay with you till I come back or till your mother comes , for she ought to have been back long ago . 
She will give you some lunch , too . 
You 'll give them something , Agafya , wo n't you ? '' 
`` That I can do . '' 
`` Good-bye , chickens , I go with my heart at rest . 
And you , granny , '' he added gravely , in an undertone , as he passed Agafya , `` I hope you 'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman 's nonsense about Katerina . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Get along with you ! '' 
retorted Agafya , really angry this time . 
`` Ridiculous boy ! 
You want a whipping for saying such things , that 's what you want ! '' 
The Schoolboy BUT Kolya did not hear her . 
At last he could go out . 
As he went out at the gate he looked round him , shrugged up his shoulders , and saying `` It is freezing , '' went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market-place . 
When he reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at the gate , pulled a whistle out of his pocket , and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal . 
He had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven , wearing a warm , neat and even stylish coat , darted out to meet him . 
This was Smurov , a boy in the preparatory class -LRB- two classes below Kolya Krassotkin -RRB- , son of a well-to-do official . 
Apparently he was forbidden by his parents to associate with Krassotkin , who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy , so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly . 
He was - if the reader has not forgotten one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha . 
He was the one who told Alyosha about Ilusha . 
`` I 've been waiting for you for the last hour , Krassotkin , '' said Smurov stolidly , and the boys strode towards the market-place . 
`` I am late , '' answered Krassotkin . 
`` I was detained by circumstances . 
You wo n't be thrashed for coming with me ? '' 
`` Come , I say , I 'm never thrashed ! 
And you 've got Perezvon with you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You 're taking him , too ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Ah !
