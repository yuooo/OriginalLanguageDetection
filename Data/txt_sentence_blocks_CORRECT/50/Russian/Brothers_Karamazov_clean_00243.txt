I should like to have a chat with you , my dear boy , but I have n't the time . 
And there 's no need , it 's too late for talking . 
Where 's my money ? 
Where have I put it ? '' 
he cried , thrusting his hands into his pockets . 
`` You put it on the table ... yourself ... . 
Here it is . 
Had you forgotten ? 
Money 's like dirt or water to you , it seems . 
Here are your pistols . 
It 's an odd thing , at six o'clock you pledged them for ten roubles , and now you 've got thousands . 
Two or three I should say . '' 
`` Three , you bet , '' laughed Mitya , stuffing the notes into the side-pocket of his trousers . 
`` You 'll lose it like that . 
Have you found a gold mine ? '' 
`` The mines ? 
The gold mines ? '' 
Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and went off into a roar of laughter . 
`` Would you like to go to the mines , Perhotin ? 
There 's a lady here who 'll stump up three thousand for you , if only you 'll go . 
She did it for me , she 's so awfully fond of gold mines . 
Do you know Madame Hohlakov ? '' 
`` I do n't know her , but I 've heard of her and seen her . 
Did she really give you three thousand ? 
Did she really ? '' 
said Pyotr Ilyitch , eyeing him dubiously . 
`` As soon as the sun rises to-morrow , as soon as Phoebus , ever young , flies upwards , praising and glorifying God , you go to her , this Madame Hohlakov , and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not . 
Try and find out . '' 
`` I do n't know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively , I suppose she did give it to you . 
You 've got the money in your hand , but instead of going to Siberia you 're spending it all ... . 
Where are you really off to now , eh ? '' 
`` To Mokroe . '' 
`` To Mokroe ? 
But it 's night ! '' 
`` Once the lad had all , now the lad has naught , '' cried Mitya suddenly . 
`` How ` naught ' ? 
You say that with all those thousands ! '' 
`` I 'm not talking about thousands . 
Damn thousands ! 
I 'm talking of female character . 
Fickle is the heart of woman Treacherous and full of vice ; I agree with Ulysses . 
That 's what he says . '' 
`` I do n't understand you ! '' 
`` Am I drunk ? '' 
`` Not drunk , but worse . '' 
`` I 'm drunk in spirit , Pyotr Ilyitch , drunk in spirit ! 
But that 's enough ! '' 
`` What are you doing , loading the pistol ? '' 
`` I 'm loading the pistol . '' 
Unfastening the pistol-case , Mitya actually opened the powder horn , and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge .
