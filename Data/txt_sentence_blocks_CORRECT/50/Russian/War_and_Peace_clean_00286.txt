That 's it , come on ! 
Nothing will remain . 
Then why harm anyone ? '' 
`` Uncle 's '' face was very significant and even handsome as he said this . 
Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors . 
Throughout the whole province `` Uncle '' had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks . 
They called him in to decide family disputes , chose him as executor , confided secrets to him , elected him to be a justice and to other posts ; but he always persistently refused public appointments , passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding , sitting at home in winter , and lying in his overgrown garden in summer . 
`` Why do n't you enter the service , Uncle ? '' 
`` I did once , but gave it up . 
I am not fit for it . 
That 's it , come on ! 
I ca n't make head or tail of it . 
That 's for you -- I have n't brains enough . 
Now , hunting is another matter -- that 's it , come on ! 
Open the door , there ! '' 
he shouted . 
`` Why have you shut it ? '' 
The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen 's room , as they called the room for the hunt servants . 
There was a rapid patter of bare feet , and an unseen hand opened the door into the huntsmen 's room , from which came the clear sounds of a balalayka on which someone , who was evidently a master of the art , was playing . 
Natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better . 
`` That 's Mitka , my coachman ... . 
I have got him a good balalayka . 
I 'm fond of it , '' said `` Uncle . '' 
It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmen 's room when `` Uncle '' returned from the chase . 
`` Uncle '' was fond of such music . 
`` How good ! 
Really very good ! '' 
said Nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness , as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much . 
`` Very good ? '' 
said Natasha reproachfully , noticing her brother 's tone . 
`` Not ` very good ' it 's simply delicious ! '' 
Just as `` Uncle 's '' pickled mushrooms , honey , and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world , so also that song , at that moment , seemed to her the acme of musical delight . 
`` More , please , more ! '' 
cried Natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka ceased . 
Mitka tuned up afresh , and recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of My Lady , with trills and variations . 
`` Uncle '' sat listening , slightly smiling , with his head on one side . 
The air was repeated a hundred times . 
The balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again , but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again . 
Anisya Fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost . 
`` You like listening ? '' 
she said to Natasha , with a smile extremely like `` Uncle 's . '' 
`` That 's a good player of ours , '' she added . 
`` He does n't play that part right ! '' 
said `` Uncle '' suddenly , with an energetic gesture . 
`` Here he ought to burst out -- that 's it , come on ! 
- ought to burst out . '' 
`` Do you play then ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` Uncle '' did not answer , but smiled . 
`` Anisya , go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right .
