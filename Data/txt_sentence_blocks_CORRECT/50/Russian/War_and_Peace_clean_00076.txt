You 're quick at taking offense , but you do n't mind disgracing the whole regiment ! '' 
The staff captain 's voice began to tremble . 
`` You have been in the regiment next to no time , my lad , you 're here today and tomorrow you 'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said ` There are thieves among the Pavlograd officers ! ' 
But it 's not all the same to us ! 
Am I not right , Denisov ? 
It 's not the same ! '' 
Denisov remained silent and did not move , but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostov . 
`` You value your own pride and do n't wish to apologize , '' continued the staff captain , `` but we old fellows , who have grown up in and , God willing , are going to die in the regiment , we prize the honor of the regiment , and Bogdanich knows it . 
Oh , we do prize it , old fellow ! 
And all this is not right , it 's not right ! 
You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth . 
It 's not right ! '' 
And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov . 
`` That 's twue , devil take it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , jumping up . 
`` Now then , Wostov , now then ! '' 
Rostov , growing red and pale alternately , looked first at one officer and then at the other . 
`` No , gentlemen , no ... you must n't think ... I quite understand . 
You 're wrong to think that of me ... I. . . 
for me ... for the honor of the regiment I 'd ... Ah well , I 'll show that in action , and for me the honor of the flag ... Well , never mind , it 's true I 'm to blame , to blame all round . 
Well , what else do you want ? 
... '' `` Come , that 's right , Count ! '' 
cried the staff captain , turning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand . 
`` I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , `` he 's a fine fellow . '' 
`` That 's better , Count , '' said the staff captain , beginning to address Rostov by his title , as if in recognition of his confession . 
`` Go and apologize , your excellency . 
Yes , go ! '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'll do anything . 
No one shall hear a word from me , '' said Rostov in an imploring voice , `` but I ca n't apologize , by God I ca n't , do what you will ! 
How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness ? '' 
Denisov began to laugh . 
`` It 'll be worse for you . 
Bogdanich is vindictive and you 'll pay for your obstinacy , '' said Kirsten . 
`` No , on my word it 's not obstinacy ! 
I ca n't describe the feeling . 
I ca n't ... '' `` Well , it 's as you like , '' said the staff captain . 
`` And what has become of that scoundrel ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He has weported himself sick , he 's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow , '' muttered Denisov . 
`` It is an illness , there 's no other way of explaining it , '' said the staff captain . 
`` Illness or not , he 'd better not cwoss my path . 
I 'd kill him ! '' 
shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone . 
Just then Zherkov entered the room . 
`` What brings you here ? '' 
cried the officers turning to the newcomer . 
`` We 're to go into action , gentlemen ! 
Mack has surrendered with his whole army . '' 
`` It 's not true ! '' 
`` I 've seen him myself ! ''
