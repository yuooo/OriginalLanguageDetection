Evidently for them `` the marshal '' represented a very high and rather mysterious power . 
These first days , before the eighth of September when the prisoners were had up for a second examination , were the hardest of all for Pierre . 
On the eighth of September an officer -- a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him -- entered the coach house where the prisoners were . 
This officer , probably someone on the staff , was holding a paper in his hand , and called over all the Russians there , naming Pierre as `` the man who does not give his name . '' 
Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners , he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal . 
An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin 's Field . 
It was a fine day , sunny after rain , and the air was unusually pure . 
The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart , but rose through the pure air in columns . 
No flames were seen , but columns of smoke rose on all sides , and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin . 
On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing , and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses . 
Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well . 
Here and there he could see churches that had not been burned . 
The Kremlin , which was not destroyed , gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Ivan the Great . 
The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly . 
These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin . 
But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday : everywhere were blackened ruins , and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the French . 
It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed , but in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed , Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different , firm , French order had been established over this ruined nest . 
He felt this in the looks of the soldiers who , marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily , were escorting him and the other criminals ; he felt it in the looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier , whom they met on the way . 
He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field , and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out when he came that morning . 
Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men , and it seemed that they might have forgotten him , or confused him with the others . 
But no : the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as `` the man who does not give his name , '' and under that appellation , which to Pierre seemed terrible , they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place . 
Pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well . 
He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin 's Field , to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent . 
This was Prince Shcherbitov 's house , where Pierre had often been in other days , and which , as he learned from the talk of the soldiers , was now occupied by the marshal , the Duke of Eckmuhl -LRB- Davout -RRB- . 
They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one . 
Pierre was the sixth to enter . 
He was conducted through a glass gallery , an anteroom , and a hall , which were familiar to him , into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant . 
Davout , spectacles on nose , sat bent over a table at the further end of the room . 
Pierre went close up to him , but Davout , evidently consulting a paper that lay before him , did not look up . 
Without raising his eyes , he said in a low voice : `` Who are you ? '' 
Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word . 
To him Davout was not merely a French general , but a man notorious for his cruelty . 
Looking at his cold face , as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer , Pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life ; but he did not know what to say . 
He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination , yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing . 
So he was silent . 
But before he had decided what to do , Davout raised his head , pushed his spectacles back on his forehead , screwed up his eyes , and looked intently at him . 
`` I know that man , '' he said in a cold , measured tone , evidently calculated to frighten Pierre . 
The chill that had been running down Pierre 's back now seized his head as in a vise . 
`` You can not know me , General , I have never seen you ... '' `` He is a Russian spy , '' Davout interrupted , addressing another general who was present , but whom Pierre had not noticed . 
Davout turned away . 
With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre rapidly began : `` No , monseigneur , '' he said , suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke . 
`` No , monseigneur , you can not have known me . 
I am a militia officer and have not quitted Moscow . '' 
`` Your name ? '' 
asked Davout . 
`` Bezukhov . '' 
`` What proof have I that you are not lying ? '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre , not in an offended but in a pleading voice . 
Davout looked up and gazed intently at him .
