`` They are waiting for their younger son , '' Pierre replied . 
`` He joined Obolenski 's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment is being formed . 
But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day . 
The count wanted to leave long ago , but the countess wo n't on any account leave Moscow till her son returns . '' 
`` I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs ' . 
Natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter . 
She sang a song . 
How easily some people get over everything ! '' 
`` Get over what ? '' 
inquired Pierre , looking displeased . 
Julie smiled . 
`` You know , Count , such knights as you are only found in Madame de Souza 's novels . '' 
`` What knights ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
demanded Pierre , blushing . 
`` Oh , come , my dear count ! 
C'est la fable de tout Moscou . 
Je vous admire , ma parole d'honneur ! '' 
* * `` It is the talk of all Moscow . 
My word , I admire you ! '' 
`` Forfeit , forfeit ! '' 
cried the militia officer . 
`` All right , one ca n't talk -- how tiresome ! '' 
`` What is ` the talk of all Moscow ' ? '' 
Pierre asked angrily , rising to his feet . 
`` Come now , Count , you know ! '' 
`` I do n't know anything about it , '' said Pierre . 
`` I know you were friendly with Natalie , and so ... but I was always more friendly with Vera -- that dear Vera . '' 
`` No , madame ! '' 
Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure , `` I have not taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova 's knight at all , and have not been their house for nearly a month . 
But I can not understand the cruelty ... '' `` Qui s ` excuse s ` accuse , '' * said Julie , smiling and waving the lint triumphantly , and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject . 
`` Do you know what I heard today ? 
Poor Mary Bolkonskaya arrived in Moscow yesterday . 
Do you know that she has lost her father ? '' 
* `` Who excuses himself , accuses himself . '' 
`` Really ? 
Where is she ? 
I should like very much to see her , '' said Pierre . 
`` I spent the evening with her yesterday . 
She is going to their estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning , with her nephew . '' 
`` Well , and how is she ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
`` She is well , but sad . 
But do you know who rescued her ? 
It is quite a romance . 
Nicholas Rostov ! 
She was surrounded , and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people . 
He rushed in and saved her ... '' `` Another romance , '' said the militia officer . 
`` Really , this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off . 
Catiche is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another . ''
