Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt , and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face . 
Having looked in a mirror , and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it , he lifted a glass of wine . 
`` Well , good-by , Theodore . 
Thank you for everything and farewell ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Well , comrades and friends ... '' he considered for a moment '' ... of my youth , farewell ! '' 
he said , turning to Makarin and the others . 
Though they were all going with him , Anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades . 
He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg . 
`` All take glasses ; you too , Balaga . 
Well , comrades and friends of my youth , we 've had our fling and lived and reveled . 
Eh ? 
And now , when shall we meet again ? 
I am going abroad . 
We have had a good time -- now farewell , lads ! 
To our health ! 
Hurrah ! 
... '' he cried , and emptying his glass flung it on the floor . 
`` To your health ! '' 
said Balaga who also emptied his glass , and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief . 
Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes . 
`` Ah , Prince , how sorry I am to part from you ! 
`` Let 's go . 
Let 's go ! '' 
cried Anatole . 
Balaga was about to leave the room . 
`` No , stop ! '' 
said Anatole . 
`` Shut the door ; we have first to sit down . 
That 's the way . '' 
They shut the door and all sat down . 
`` Now , quick march , lads ! '' 
said Anatole , rising . 
Joseph , his valet , handed him his sabretache and saber , and they all went out into the vestibule . 
`` And where 's the fur cloak ? '' 
asked Dolokhov . 
`` Hey , Ignatka ! 
Go to Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak . 
I have heard what elopements are like , '' continued Dolokhov with a wink . 
`` Why , she 'll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing ; if you delay at all there 'll be tears and ` Papa ' and ` Mamma , ' and she 's frozen in a minute and must go back -- but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh . '' 
The valet brought a woman 's fox-lined cloak . 
`` Fool , I told you the sable one ! 
Hey , Matrena , the sable ! '' 
he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms . 
A handsome , slim , and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue-black hair , wearing a red shawl , ran out with a sable mantle on her arm . 
`` Here , I do n't grudge it -- take it ! '' 
she said , evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak . 
Dolokhov , without answering , took the cloak , threw it over Matrena , and wrapped her up in it . 
`` That 's the way , '' said Dolokhov , `` and then so ! '' 
and he turned the collar up round her head , leaving only a little of the face uncovered .
