And not waiting for a reply he answered his own question : `` You see I was told to find out - well , I am finding out ... . 
Only do let me into the very ... into the chief ... I do n't want a reward ... But I want ... '' Petya clenched his teeth and looked around , throwing back his head and flourishing his arms . 
`` Into the vewy chief ... '' Denisov repeated with a smile . 
`` Only , please let me command something , so that I may really command ... '' Petya went on . 
`` What would it be to you ? 
... Oh , you want a knife ? '' 
he said , turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton . 
And he handed him his clasp knife . 
The officer admired it . 
`` Please keep it . 
I have several like it , '' said Petya , blushing . 
`` Heavens ! 
I was quite forgetting ! '' 
he suddenly cried . 
`` I have some raisins , fine ones ; you know , seedless ones . 
We have a new sutler and he has such capital things . 
I bought ten pounds . 
I am used to something sweet . 
Would you like some ? 
... '' and Petya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins . 
`` Have some , gentlemen , have some ! '' 
`` You want a coffeepot , do n't you ? '' 
he asked the esaul . 
`` I bought a capital one from our sutler ! 
He has splendid things . 
And he 's very honest , that 's the chief thing . 
I 'll be sure to send it to you . 
Or perhaps your flints are giving out , or are worn out -- that happens sometimes , you know . 
I have brought some with me , here they are '' - and he showed a bag -- `` a hundred flints . 
I bought them very cheap . 
Please take as many as you want , or all if you like ... '' Then suddenly , dismayed lest he had said too much , Petya stopped and blushed . 
He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish . 
And running over the events of the day he remembered the French drummer boy . 
`` It 's capital for us here , but what of him ? 
Where have they put him ? 
Have they fed him ? 
Have n't they hurt his feelings ? '' 
he thought . 
But having caught himself saying too much about the flints , he was now afraid to speak out . 
`` I might ask , '' he thought , `` but they 'll say : ` He 's a boy himself and so he pities the boy . ' 
I 'll show them tomorrow whether I 'm a boy . 
Will it seem odd if I ask ? '' 
Petya thought . 
`` Well , never mind ! '' 
and immediately , blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical , he said : `` May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat ? 
... Perhaps ... '' `` Yes , he 's a poor little fellow , '' said Denisov , who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder . 
`` Call him in . 
His name is Vincent Bosse . 
Have him fetched . '' 
`` I 'll call him , '' said Petya .
