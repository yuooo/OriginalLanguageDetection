`` I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not come and brought his pupil with him '' -LRB- for some reason Prince Bolkonski referred to Anatole as a `` pupil '' -RRB- `` for the sake of my beautiful eyes . 
Last night a proposition was made me on your account and , as you know my principles , I refer it to you . '' 
`` How am I to understand you , mon pere ? '' 
said the princess , growing pale and then blushing . 
`` How understand me ! '' 
cried her father angrily . 
`` Prince Vasili finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil 's behalf . 
That 's how it 's to be understood ! 
` How understand it ' ! 
... And I ask you ! '' 
`` I do not know what you think , Father , '' whispered the princess . 
`` I ? 
I ? 
What of me ? 
Leave me out of the question . 
I 'm not going to get married . 
What about you ? 
That 's what I want to know . '' 
The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval , but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never . 
She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think , but would only be able to submit from habit , and she said : `` I wish only to do your will , but if I had to express my own desire ... '' She had no time to finish . 
The old prince interrupted her . 
`` That 's admirable ! '' 
he shouted . 
`` He will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain . 
She 'll be the wife , while you ... '' The prince stopped . 
He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter . 
She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears . 
`` Now then , now then , I 'm only joking ! '' 
he said . 
`` Remember this , Princess , I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose . 
I give you freedom . 
Only remember that your life 's happiness depends on your decision . 
Never mind me ! '' 
`` But I do not know , Father ! '' 
`` There 's no need to talk ! 
He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody ; but you are free to choose ... . 
Go to your room , think it over , and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence : yes or no . 
I know you will pray over it . 
Well , pray if you like , but you had better think it over . 
Go ! 
Yes or no , yes or no , yes or no ! '' 
he still shouted when the princess , as if lost in a fog , had already staggered out of the study . 
Her fate was decided and happily decided . 
But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful . 
It was untrue to be sure , but still it was terrible , and she could not help thinking of it . 
She was going straight on through the conservatory , neither seeing nor hearing anything , when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her . 
She raised her eyes , and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her . 
With a horrified expression on his handsome face , Anatole looked at Princess Mary , but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her . 
`` Who 's that ? 
Why ?
