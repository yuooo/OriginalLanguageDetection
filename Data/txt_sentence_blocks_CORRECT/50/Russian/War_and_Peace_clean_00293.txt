It 's as if it were a dream ! 
I like that . '' 
`` And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom , and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet ? 
Was that real or not ? 
Do you remember what fun it was ? '' 
`` Yes , and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch ? '' 
So they went through their memories , smiling with pleasure : not the sad memories of old age , but poetic , youthful ones -- those impressions of one 's most distant past in which dreams and realities blend -- and they laughed with quiet enjoyment . 
Sonya , as always , did not quite keep pace with them , though they shared the same reminiscences . 
Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind , and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced . 
She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it . 
She only really took part when they recalled Sonya 's first arrival . 
She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she , too , would be sewn up with cords . 
`` And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage , '' said Natasha , `` and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it then , but knew that it was not true , and I felt so uncomfortable . '' 
While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room . 
`` They have brought the cock , Miss , '' she said in a whisper . 
`` It is n't wanted , Petya . 
Tell them to take it away , '' replied Natasha . 
In the middle of their talk in the sitting room , Dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner . 
He took off its cloth covering , and the harp gave out a jarring sound . 
`` Mr. Dimmler , please play my favorite nocturne by Field , '' came the old countess ' voice from the drawing room . 
Dimmler struck a chord and , turning to Natasha , Nicholas , and Sonya , remarked : `` How quiet you young people are ! '' 
`` Yes , we 're philosophizing , '' said Natasha , glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation . 
They were now discussing dreams . 
Dimmler began to play ; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table , took up a candle , carried it out , and returned , seating herself quietly in her former place . 
It was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa , but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor . 
Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings , evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else . 
`` Do you know , '' said Natasha in a whisper , moving closer to Nicholas and Sonya , `` that when one goes on and on recalling memories , one at last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world ... '' `` That is metempsychosis , '' said Sonya , who had always learned well , and remembered everything . 
`` The Egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals , and will go back into animals again . '' 
`` No , I do n't believe we ever were in animals , '' said Natasha , still in a whisper though the music had ceased . 
`` But I am certain that we were angels somewhere there , and have been here , and that is why we remember ... '' `` May I join you ? '' 
said Dimmler who had come up quietly , and he sat down by them . 
`` If we have been angels , why have we fallen lower ? '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` No , that ca n't be ! '' 
`` Not lower , who said we were lower ? 
... How do I know what I was before ? '' 
Natasha rejoined with conviction . 
`` The soul is immortal -- well then , if I shall always live I must have lived before , lived for a whole eternity . '' 
`` Yes , but it is hard for us to imagine eternity , '' remarked Dimmler , who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they . 
`` Why is it hard to imagine eternity ? '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It is now today , and it will be tomorrow , and always ; and there was yesterday , and the day before ... '' `` Natasha ! 
Now it 's your turn . 
Sing me something , '' they heard the countess say . 
`` Why are you sitting there like conspirators ? '' 
`` Mamma , I do n't at all want to , '' replied Natasha , but all the same she rose . 
None of them , not even the middle-aged Dimmler , wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room , but Natasha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord . 
Standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best , Natasha began to sing her mother 's favorite song . 
She had said she did not want to sing , but it was long since she had sung , and long before she again sang , as she did that evening . 
The count , from his study where he was talking to Mitenka , heard her and , like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play , blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward , and at last stopped , while Mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling .
