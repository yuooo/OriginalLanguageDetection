He 's treated me badly himself , so he attacked me , to make out I am in fault first and to throw it all on me . 
` You were with your Pole before me , so I ca n't be blamed for Katerina , ' that 's what it amounts to . 
He wants to throw the whole blame on me . 
He attacked me on purpose , on purpose , I tell you , but I 'll - '' Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do . 
She hid her eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently . 
`` He does n't love Katerina Ivanovna , '' said Alyosha firmly . 
`` Well , whether he loves her or not , I 'll soon find out for myself , '' said Grushenka , with a menacing note in her voice , taking the handkerchief from her eyes . 
Her face was distorted . 
Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene , it had become sullen and spiteful . 
`` Enough of this foolishness , '' she said suddenly ; `` it 's not for that I sent for you . 
Alyosha , darling , to-morrow - what will happen to-morrow ? 
That 's what worries me ! 
And it 's only me it worries ! 
I look at everyone and no one is thinking of it . 
No one cares about it . 
Are you thinking about it even ? 
To-morrow he 'll be tried , you know . 
Tell me , how will he be tried ? 
You know it 's the valet , the valet killed him ! 
Good heavens ! 
Can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him ? 
They have n't troubled the valet at all , have they ? '' 
`` He 's been severely cross-examined , '' observed Alyosha thoughtfully ; `` but everyone came to the conclusion it was not he . 
Now he is lying very ill . 
He has been ill ever since that attack . 
Really ill , '' added Alyosha . 
`` Oh , dear ! 
could n't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself ? 
He 's been brought from Petersburg for three thousand roubles , they say . '' 
`` We gave these three thousand together - Ivan , Katerina Ivanovna and I - but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself . 
The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more , but the case has become known all over Russia ; it 's talked of in all the papers and journals . 
Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing , because the case has become so notorious . 
I saw him yesterday . '' 
`` Well ? 
Did you talk to him ? '' 
Grushenka put in eagerly . 
`` He listened and said nothing . 
He told me that he had already formed his opinion . 
But he promised to give my words consideration . '' 
`` Consideration ! 
Ah , they are swindlers ! 
They 'll ruin him . 
And why did she send for the doctor ? '' 
`` As an expert . 
They want to prove that Mitya 's mad and committed the murder when he did n't know what he was doing , '' Alyosha smiled gently , `` but Mitya wo n't agree to that . '' 
`` Yes ; but that would be the truth if he had killed him ! '' 
cried Grushenka . 
`` He was mad then , perfectly mad , and that was my fault , wretch that I am ! 
But , of course , he did n't do it , he did n't do it ! 
And they are all against him , the whole town .
