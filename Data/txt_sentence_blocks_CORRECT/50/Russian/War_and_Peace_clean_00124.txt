`` No , it will not do , '' she said decidedly , clasping her hands . 
`` No , Mary , really this dress does not suit you . 
I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress . 
Now please , do it for my sake . 
Katie , '' she said to the maid , `` bring the princess her gray dress , and you 'll see , Mademoiselle Bourienne , how I shall arrange it , '' she added , smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure . 
But when Katie brought the required dress , Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass , looking at her face , and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering , ready to burst into sobs . 
`` Come , dear princess , '' said Mademoiselle Bourienne , `` just one more little effort . '' 
The little princess , taking the dress from the maid , came up to Princess Mary . 
`` Well , now we 'll arrange something quite simple and becoming , '' she said . 
The three voices , hers , Mademoiselle Bourienne 's , and Katie 's , who was laughing at something , mingled in a merry sound , like the chirping of birds . 
`` No , leave me alone , '' said Princess Mary . 
Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once . 
They looked at the beautiful , large , thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts , gazing shiningly and imploringly at them , and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist . 
`` At least , change your coiffure , '' said the little princess . 
`` Did n't I tell you , '' she went on , turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne , `` Mary 's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least . 
Not in the least ! 
Please change it . '' 
`` Leave me alone , please leave me alone ! 
It is all quite the same to me , '' answered a voice struggling with tears . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain , worse than usual , but it was too late . 
She was looking at them with an expression they both knew , an expression thoughtful and sad . 
This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them -LRB- she never inspired fear in anyone -RRB- , but they knew that when it appeared on her face , she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination . 
`` You will change it , wo n't you ? '' 
said Lise . 
And as Princess Mary gave no answer , she left the room . 
Princess Mary was left alone . 
She did not comply with Lise 's request , she not only left her hair as it was , but did not even look in her glass . 
Letting her arms fall helplessly , she sat with downcast eyes and pondered . 
A husband , a man , a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination , and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own . 
She fancied a child , her own -- such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse 's daughter -- at her own breast , the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child . 
`` But no , it is impossible , I am too ugly , '' she thought . 
`` Please come to tea . 
The prince will be out in a moment , '' came the maid 's voice at the door . 
She roused herself , and felt appalled at what she had been thinking , and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and , her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp , she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments . 
A painful doubt filled her soul . 
Could the joy of love , of earthly love for a man , be for her ? 
In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children , but her strongest , most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love . 
The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself , the stronger it grew . 
`` O God , '' she said , `` how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil ? 
How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies , so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will ? '' 
And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart . 
`` Desire nothing for thyself , seek nothing , be not anxious or envious . 
Man 's future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee , but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything . 
If it be God 's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage , be ready to fulfill His will . '' 
With this consoling thought -LRB- but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing -RRB- Princess Mary sighed , and having crossed herself went down , thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say . 
What could all that matter in comparison with the will of God , without Whose care not a hair of man 's head can fall ? 
When Princess Mary came down , Prince Vasili and his son were already in the drawing room , talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
When she entered with her heavy step , treading on her heels , the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess , indicating her to the gentlemen , said : `` Voila Marie ! '' 
Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail . 
She saw Prince Vasili 's face , serious for an instant at the sight of her , but immediately smiling again , and the little princess curiously noting the impression `` Marie '' produced on the visitors .
