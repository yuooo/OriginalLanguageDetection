`` Faro ? 
Splendid ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` If only the panovie - '' `` It 's lite , panovie , '' the Pole on the sofa responded , as it were unwillingly . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Lite ? 
What do you mean by ` lite ' ? '' 
asked Grushenka . 
`` Late , pani ! ' 
A late hour ' I mean , '' the Pole on the sofa explained . 
`` It 's always late with them . 
They can never do anything ! '' 
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger . 
`` They 're dull themselves , so they want others to be dull . 
Before came , Mitya , they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me . '' 
`` My goddess ! '' 
cried the Pole on the sofa , `` I see you 're not well-disposed to me , that 's why I 'm gloomy . 
I 'm ready , panie , '' added he , addressing Mitya . 
`` Begin , panie , '' Mitya assented , pulling his notes out of his pocket , and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table . 
`` I want to lose a lot to you . 
Take your cards . 
Make the bank . '' 
`` We 'll have cards from the landlord , panie , '' said the little Pole , gravely and emphatically . 
`` That 's much the best way , '' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` From the landlord ? 
Very good , I understand , let 's get them from him . 
Cards ! '' 
Mitya shouted to the landlord . 
The landlord brought in a new , unopened pack , and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready , and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon ; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived . 
Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders , but only three girls had arrived , and Marya was not there yet . 
And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out . 
He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls , the sweets , the toffee and the fondants . 
`` And vodka for Andrey , vodka for Andrey ! '' 
he cried in haste . 
`` I was rude to Andrey ! '' 
Suddenly Maximov , who had followed him out , touched him on the shoulder . 
`` Give me five roubles , '' he whispered to Mitya . 
`` I 'll stake something at faro , too , he he ! '' 
`` Capital ! 
Splendid ! 
Take ten , here ! '' 
Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles . 
`` And if you lose that , come again , come again . '' 
`` Very good , '' Maximov whispered joyfully , and he ran back again . 
Mitya , too , returned , apologising for having kept them waiting . 
The Poles had already sat down , and opened the pack . 
They looked much more amiable , almost cordial . 
The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw . 
He wore an air of solemnity . 
`` To your places , gentlemen , '' cried Pan Vrublevsky .
