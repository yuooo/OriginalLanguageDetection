Princess Mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair , and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep , radiant eyes . 
The weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off . 
With a deep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk . 
When Natasha left the room Pierre 's confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement . 
He quickly moved an armchair toward Princess Mary . 
`` Yes , I wanted to tell you , '' said he , answering her look as if she had spoken . 
`` Princess , help me ! 
What am I to do ? 
Can I hope ? 
Princess , my dear friend , listen ! 
I know it all . 
I know I am not worthy of her , I know it 's impossible to speak of it now . 
But I want to be a brother to her . 
No , not that , I do n't , I ca n't ... '' He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands . 
`` Well , '' he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence . 
`` I do n't know when I began to love her , but I have loved her and her alone all my life , and I love her so that I can not imagine life without her . 
I can not propose to her at present , but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that possibility ... that possibility ... is terrible . 
Tell me , can I hope ? 
Tell me what I am to do , dear princess ! '' 
he added after a pause , and touched her hand as she did not reply . 
`` I am thinking of what you have told me , '' answered Princess Mary . 
`` This is what I will say . 
You are right that to speak to her of love at present ... '' Princess Mary stopped . 
She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible , but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love , but that it was the very thing she wished for . 
`` To speak to her now would n't do , '' said the princess all the same . 
`` But what am I to do ? '' 
`` Leave it to me , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` I know ... '' Pierre was looking into Princess Mary 's eyes . 
`` Well ? 
... Well ? 
... '' he said . 
`` I know that she loves ... will love you , '' Princess Mary corrected herself . 
Before her words were out , Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary 's hand . 
`` What makes you think so ? 
You think I may hope ? 
You think ... ? '' 
`` Yes , I think so , '' said Princess Mary with a smile . 
`` Write to her parents , and leave it to me . 
I will tell her when I can . 
I wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will . '' 
`` No , it can not be ! 
How happy I am ! 
But it ca n't be ... . 
How happy I am ! 
No , it ca n't be ! '' 
Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary 's hands . 
`` Go to Petersburg , that will be best . 
And I will write to you , '' she said . 
`` To Petersburg ? 
Go there ?
