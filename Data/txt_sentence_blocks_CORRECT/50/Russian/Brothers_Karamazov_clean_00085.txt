`` What does Ivan say ? 
Alyosha , my dear , my only son , I 'm afraid of Ivan . 
I 'm more afraid of Ivan than the other . 
You 're the only one I 'm not afraid of ... '' `` Do n't be afraid of Ivan either . 
He is angry , but he 'll defend you . '' 
`` Alyosha , and what of the other ? 
He 's run to Grushenka . 
My angel , tell me the truth , was she here just now or not ? '' 
`` No one has seen her . 
It was a mistake . 
She has not been here . '' 
`` You know Mitya wants to marry her , to marry her . '' 
`` She wo n't marry him . '' 
`` She wo n't . 
She wo n't . 
She wo n't . 
She wo n't on any account ! '' 
The old man fairly fluttered with joy , as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him . 
In his delight he seized Alyosha 's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart . 
Tears positively glittered in his eyes . 
`` That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now , '' he said . 
`` Take it home and keep it for yourself . 
And I 'll let you go back to the monastery ... . 
I was joking this morning , do n't be angry with me . 
My head aches , Alyosha ... . 
Alyosha , comfort my heart . 
Be an angel and tell me the truth ! '' 
`` You 're still asking whether she has been here or not ? '' 
Alyosha said sorrowfully . 
`` No , no , no . 
I believe you . 
I 'll tell you what it is : you go to Grushenka yourself , or see her somehow ; make haste and ask her ; see for yourself , which she means to choose , him or me . 
Eh ? 
What ? 
Can you ? '' 
`` If I see her I 'll ask her , '' Alyosha muttered , embarrassed . 
`` No , she wo n't tell you , '' the old man interrupted , `` she 's a rogue . 
She 'll begin kissing you and say that it 's you she wants . 
She 's a deceitful , shameless hussy . 
You must n't go to her , you must n't ! '' 
`` No father , and it would n't be suitable , it would n't be right at all . '' 
`` Where was he sending you just now ? 
He shouted ` Go ' as he ran away . '' 
`` For money ? 
To ask her for money ? '' 
`` No . 
Not for money . '' 
`` He 's no money ; not a farthing . 
I 'll settle down for the night , and think things over , and you can go . 
Perhaps you 'll meet her ... .
