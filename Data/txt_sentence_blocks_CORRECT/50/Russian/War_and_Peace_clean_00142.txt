Prince Andrew introduced his protege , but Prince Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Boris and , evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment , addressed Prince Andrew in French . 
`` Ah , my dear fellow , what a battle we have gained ! 
God grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious ! 
However , dear fellow , '' he said abruptly and eagerly , `` I must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother . 
What exactitude , what minuteness , what knowledge of the locality , what foresight for every eventuality , every possibility even to the smallest detail ! 
No , my dear fellow , no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised . 
This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor -- what more could be wished for ? '' 
`` So the attack is definitely resolved on ? '' 
asked Bolkonski . 
`` And do you know , my dear fellow , it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings , you know that a letter was received from him today for the Emperor . '' 
Dolgorukov smiled significantly . 
`` Is that so ? 
And what did he say ? '' 
inquired Bolkonski . 
`` What can he say ? 
Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on ... merely to gain time . 
I tell you he is in our hands , that 's certain ! 
But what was most amusing , '' he continued , with a sudden , good-natured laugh , `` was that we could not think how to address the reply ! 
If not as ` Consul ' and of course not as 'Em peror , ' it seemed to me it should be to ` General Bonaparte . ' '' 
`` But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General Bonaparte , there is a difference , '' remarked Bolkonski . 
`` That 's just it , '' interrupted Dolgorukov quickly , laughing . 
`` You know Bilibin -- he 's a very clever fellow . 
He suggested addressing him as ` Usurper and Enemy of Mankind . ' '' 
Dolgorukov laughed merrily . 
`` Only that ? '' 
said Bolkonski . 
`` All the same , it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address . 
He is a wise and clever fellow . '' 
`` What was it ? '' 
`` To the Head of the French Government ... Au chef du gouvernement francais , '' said Dolgorukov , with grave satisfaction . 
`` Good , was n't it ? '' 
`` Yes , but he will dislike it extremely , '' said Bolkonski . 
`` Oh yes , very much ! 
My brother knows him , he 's dined with him -- the present Emperor -- more than once in Paris , and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist -- you know , a combination of French adroitness and Italian play-acting ! 
Do you know the tale about him and Count Markov ? 
Count Markov was the only man who knew how to handle him . 
You know the story of the handkerchief ? 
It is delightful ! '' 
And the talkative Dolgorukov , turning now to Boris , now to Prince Andrew , told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov , our ambassador , purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Markov , probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him , and how Markov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching Bonaparte 's . 
`` Delightful ! '' 
said Bolkonski . 
`` But I have come to you , Prince , as a petitioner on behalf of this young man . 
You see ... '' but before Prince Andrew could finish , an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emperor . 
`` Oh , what a nuisance , '' said Dolgorukov , getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris . 
`` You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man . '' 
Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured , sincere , and animated levity . 
`` But you see ... another time ! '' 
Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment . 
He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny , obedient , and insignificant atom . 
They followed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corridor and met -- coming out of the door of the Emperor 's room by which Dolgorukov had entered -- a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which , without spoiling his face , gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression .
