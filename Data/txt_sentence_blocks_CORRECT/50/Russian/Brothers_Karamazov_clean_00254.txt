`` Well , are they feasting ? 
Have they money ? '' 
`` Poor sort of a feast ! 
Nothing to boast of , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Nothing to boast of ? 
And who are the others ? '' 
`` They 're two gentlemen from the town ... . 
They 've come back from Tcherny , and are putting up here . 
One 's quite a young gentleman , a relative of Mr. Miusov he must be , but I 've forgotten his name ... and I expect you know the other , too , a gentleman called Maximov . 
He 's been on a pilgrimage , so he says , to the monastery in the town . 
He 's travelling with this young relation of Mr. Miusov . '' 
`` Is that all ? '' 
`` Stay , listen , Trifon Borissovitch . 
Tell me the chief thing : What of her ? 
How is she ? '' 
`` Oh , she 's only just come . 
She 's sitting with them . '' 
`` Is she cheerful ? 
Is she laughing ? '' 
`` No , I think she 's not laughing much . 
She 's sitting quite dull . 
She 's combing the young gentleman 's hair . '' 
`` The Pole - the officer ? '' 
`` He 's not young , and he 's not an officer , either . 
Not him , sir . 
It 's the young gentleman that 's Mr. Miusov 's relation . 
I 've forgotten his name . '' 
`` Kalganov ? '' 
`` That 's it , Kalganov ! '' 
`` All right . 
I 'll see for myself . 
Are they playing cards ? '' 
`` They have been playing , but they 've left off . 
They 've been drinking tea , the official gentleman asked for liqueurs . '' 
`` Stay , Trifon Borissovitch , stay , my good soul , I 'll see for myself . 
Now answer one more question : are the gypsies here ? '' 
`` You ca n't have the gypsies now , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
The authorities have sent them away . 
But we 've Jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the village , so one might send for them . 
They 'd come . '' 
`` Send for them . 
Certainly send for them ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` And you can get the girls together as you did then , Marya especially , Stepanida , too , and Arina . 
Two hundred roubles for a chorus ! '' 
`` Oh , for a sum like that I can get all the village together , though by now they 're asleep . 
Are the peasants here worth such kindness , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , or the girls either ? 
To spend a sum like that on such coarseness and rudeness ! 
What 's the good of giving a peasant a cigar to smoke , the stinking ruffian ! 
And the girls are all lousy .
