I am so afraid it will never be ! 
And , worst of all , I am growing old -- that 's the thing ! 
There wo n't then be in me what there is now . 
But perhaps he 'll come today , will come immediately . 
Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room . 
Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it . '' 
She rose , put down the guitar , and went to the drawing room . 
All the domestic circle , tutors , governesses , and guests , were already at the tea table . 
The servants stood round the table -- but Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before . 
`` Ah , here she is ! '' 
said the old count , when he saw Natasha enter . 
`` Well , sit down by me . '' 
But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something . 
`` Mamma ! '' 
she muttered , `` give him to me , give him , Mamma , quickly , quickly ! '' 
and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs . 
She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and Nicholas , who had also come to the table . 
`` My God , my God ! 
The same faces , the same talk , Papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way ! '' 
thought Natasha , feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household , because they were always the same . 
After tea , Nicholas , Sonya , and Natasha went to the sitting room , to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began . 
`` Does it ever happen to you , '' said Natasha to her brother , when they settled down in the sitting room , `` does it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come -- nothing ; that everything good is past ? 
And to feel not exactly dull , but sad ? '' 
`` I should think so ! '' 
he replied . 
`` I have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful . 
The thought has come into my mind that I was already tired of it all , and that we must all die . 
Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music ... and suddenly I felt so depressed ... '' `` Oh yes , I know , I know , I know ! '' 
Natasha interrupted him . 
`` When I was quite little that used to be so with me . 
Do you remember when I was punished once about some plums ? 
You were all dancing , and I sat sobbing in the schoolroom ? 
I shall never forget it : I felt sad and sorry for everyone , for myself , and for everyone . 
And I was innocent -- that was the chief thing , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do you remember ? '' 
`` I remember , '' answered Nicholas . 
`` I remember that I came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you , but do you know , I felt ashamed to . 
We were terribly absurd . 
I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you . 
Do you remember ? '' 
`` And do you remember , '' Natasha asked with a pensive smile , `` how once , long , long ago , when we were quite little , Uncle called us into the study -- that was in the old house -- and it was dark -- we went in and suddenly there stood ... '' `` A Negro , '' chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight . 
`` Of course I remember . 
Even now I do n't know whether there really was a Negro , or if we only dreamed it or were told about him . '' 
`` He was gray , you remember , and had white teeth , and stood and looked at us ... '' `` Sonya , do you remember ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` Yes , yes , I do remember something too , '' Sonya answered timidly . 
`` You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro , '' said Natasha , `` and they say there was no Negro at all . 
But you see , you remember ! '' 
`` Of course I do , I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them . '' 
`` How strange it is !
