I am strictly forbidden to go out with you . '' 
`` Do n't be uneasy , nothing will happen this time . 
Hallo , Natasha ! '' 
he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths . 
`` Call me Natasha ! 
What next ! 
My name is Marya , '' the middle-aged marketwoman shouted at him . 
`` I am so glad it 's Marya . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` Ah , you young rascal ! 
A brat like you to carry on so ! '' 
`` I 'm in a hurry . 
I ca n't stay now . 
You shall tell me next Sunday . '' 
Kolya waved his hand at her , as though she had attacked him and not he her . 
`` I 've nothing to tell you next Sunday . 
You set upon me , you impudent young monkey . 
I did n't say anything , '' bawled Marya . 
`` You want a whipping , that 's what you want , you saucy jackanapes ! '' 
There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her . 
Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by . 
He was a young man , not a native of the town , with dark , curly hair and a long , pale face , marked with smallpox . 
He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap , and looked like a merchant 's clerk . 
He was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya . 
`` I know you ! '' 
he cried angrily , `` I know you ! '' 
Kolya stared at him . 
He could not recall when he could have had a row with the man . 
But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all . 
`` Do you ? '' 
he asked sarcastically . 
`` I know you ! 
I know you ! '' 
the man repeated idiotically . 
So much the better for you . 
Well , it 's time I was going . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? '' 
cried the man . 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? 
I know , you are at it again ! '' 
`` It 's not your business , brother , if I am at my saucy pranks again , '' said Kolya , standing still and scanning him . 
`` Not my business ? '' 
`` No ; it 's not your business . '' 
`` Whose then ? 
Whose then ? 
Whose then ? '' 
`` It 's Trifon Nikititch 's business , not yours . '' 
`` What Trifon Nikititch ? '' 
asked the youth , staring with loutish amazement at Kolya , but still as angry as ever .
