if it were only Zhutchka ! '' 
`` That 's impossible . 
Zhutchka 's non-existent . 
Zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity . '' 
`` Ah ! 
could n't we do this ? '' 
Smurov suddenly stood still . 
`` You see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy , greyish , smoky-looking dog like Perezvon . 
Could n't you tell him this is Zhutchka , and he might believe you ? '' 
`` Boy , shun a lie , that 's one thing ; even with a good object - that 's another . 
Above all , I hope you 've not told them anything about my coming . '' 
`` Heaven forbid ! 
I know what I am about . 
But you wo n't comfort him with Perezvon , '' said Smurov , with a sigh . 
`` You know his father , the captain , ` the wisp of tow , ' told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff pup , with a black nose , to-day . 
He thinks that would comfort Ilusha ; but I doubt it . '' 
`` And how is Ilusha ? '' 
`` Ah , he is bad , very bad ! 
I believe he 's in consumption : he is quite conscious , but his breathing ! 
His breathing 's gone wrong . 
The other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the room . 
He tried to walk , but he could n't stand . 
` Ah , I told you before , father , ' he said , ` that those boots were no good . 
I could never walk properly in them . ' 
He fancied it was his boots that made him stagger , but it was simply weakness , really . 
He wo n't live another week . 
Herzenstube is looking after him . 
Now they are rich again - they 've got heaps of money . 
`` They are rogues . '' 
`` Who are rogues ? '' 
`` Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively , and also , of course , individually . 
I do n't believe in medicine . 
It 's a useless institution . 
I mean to go into all that . 
But what 's that sentimentality you 've got up there ? 
The whole class seems to be there every day . '' 
`` Not the whole class : it 's only ten of our fellows who go to see him every day . 
There 's nothing in that . '' 
`` What I do n't understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is taking in it . 
His brother 's going to be tried to-morrow or next day for such a crime , and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with boys . '' 
`` There 's no sentimentality about it . 
You are going yourself now to make it up with Ilusha . '' 
`` Make it up with him ? 
What an absurd expression ! 
But I allow no one to analyse my actions . '' 
`` And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you ! 
He has no idea that you are coming . 
Why was it , why was it you would n't come all this time ? '' 
Smurov cried with sudden warmth . 
`` My dear boy , that 's my business , not yours .
