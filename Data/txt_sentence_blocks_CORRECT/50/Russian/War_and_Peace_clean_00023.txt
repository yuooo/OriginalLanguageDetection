`` Oh no , not at all too young ! '' 
replied the count . 
`` Why , our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen . '' 
`` And she 's in love with Boris already . 
Just fancy ! '' 
said the countess with a gentle smile , looking at Boris ' and went on , evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her : `` Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly '' -LRB- she meant that they would be kissing -RRB- , `` but as it is , I know every word she utters . 
She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything . 
Perhaps I spoil her , but really that seems the best plan . 
With her elder sister I was stricter . '' 
`` Yes , I was brought up quite differently , '' remarked the handsome elder daughter , Countess Vera , with a smile . 
But the smile did not enhance Vera 's beauty as smiles generally do ; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural , and therefore unpleasant , expression . 
Vera was good-looking , not at all stupid , quick at learning , was well brought up , and had a pleasant voice ; what she said was true and appropriate , yet , strange to say , everyone - the visitors and countess alike -- turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it , and they all felt awkward . 
`` People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them , '' said the visitor . 
`` What 's the good of denying it , my dear ? 
Our dear countess was too clever with Vera , '' said the count . 
`` Well , what of that ? 
She 's turned out splendidly all the same , '' he added , winking at Vera . 
The guests got up and took their leave , promising to return to dinner . 
`` What manners ! 
I thought they would never go , '' said the countess , when she had seen her guests out . 
When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory . 
There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room , waiting for Boris to come out . 
She was already growing impatient , and stamped her foot , ready to cry at his not coming at once , when she heard the young man 's discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly . 
At this Natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there . 
Boris paused in the middle of the room , looked round , brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform , and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face . 
Natasha , very still , peered out from her ambush , waiting to see what he would do . 
He stood a little while before the glass , smiled , and walked toward the other door . 
Natasha was about to call him but changed her mind . 
`` Let him look for me , '' thought she . 
Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya , flushed , in tears , and muttering angrily , came in at the other door . 
Natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her , and remained in her hiding place , watching -- as under an invisible cap -- to see what went on in the world . 
She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure . 
Sonya , muttering to herself , kept looking round toward the drawing-room door . 
It opened and Nicholas came in . 
`` Sonya , what is the matter with you ? 
How can you ? '' 
said he , running up to her . 
`` It 's nothing , nothing ; leave me alone ! '' 
sobbed Sonya . 
`` Ah , I know what it is . '' 
`` Well , if you do , so much the better , and you can go back to her ! '' 
`` So-o-onya ! 
Look here ! 
How can you torture me and yourself like that , for a mere fancy ? '' 
said Nicholas taking her hand . 
Sonya did not pull it away , and left off crying . 
Natasha , not stirring and scarcely breathing , watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes . 
`` What will happen now ? '' 
thought she . 
`` Sonya !
