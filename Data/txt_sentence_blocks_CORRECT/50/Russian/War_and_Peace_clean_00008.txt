cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went , with the smile of a coquettish girl , which at one time probably came naturally to her , but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face . 
Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts . 
But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold , artificial expression . 
She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking , and again pretended to listen , while waiting till it would be time to leave . 
Her task was accomplished . 
`` And what do you think of this latest comedy , the coronation at Milan ? '' 
asked Anna Pavlovna , `` and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte , and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations ? 
Adorable ! 
It is enough to make one 's head whirl ! 
It is as if the whole world had gone crazy . '' 
Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile . '' 
` Dieu me la donne , gare a qui la touche ! ' 
* They say he was very fine when he said that , '' he remarked , repeating the words in Italian : '' ` Dio mi l'ha dato . 
Guai a chi la tocchi ! ' '' 
* God has given it to me , let him who touches it beware ! 
`` I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over , '' Anna Pavlovna continued . 
`` The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything . '' 
`` The sovereigns ? 
I do not speak of Russia , '' said the vicomte , polite but hopeless : `` The sovereigns , madame ... What have they done for Louis XVII , for the Queen , or for Madame Elizabeth ? 
Nothing ! '' 
and he became more animated . 
`` And believe me , they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause . 
The sovereigns ! 
Why , they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper . '' 
And sighing disdainfully , he again changed his position . 
Prince Hippolyte , who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette , suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess , and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde coat of arms on the table . 
He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it . 
`` Baton de gueules , engrele de gueules d' azur -- maison Conde , '' said he . 
The princess listened , smiling . 
`` If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer , '' the vicomte continued , with the air of a man who , in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else , does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts , `` things will have gone too far . 
By intrigues , violence , exile , and executions , French society -- I mean good French society -- will have been forever destroyed , and then ... '' He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands . 
Pierre wished to make a remark , for the conversation interested him , but Anna Pavlovna , who had him under observation , interrupted : `` The Emperor Alexander , '' said she , with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family , `` has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government ; and I believe that once free from the usurper , the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king , '' she concluded , trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant . 
`` That is doubtful , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far . 
I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime . '' 
`` From what I have heard , '' said Pierre , blushing and breaking into the conversation , `` almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte 's side . '' 
`` It is the Buonapartists who say that , '' replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre . 
`` At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion . '' 
`` Bonaparte has said so , '' remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile . 
It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him , though without looking at him . '' ' 
I showed them the path to glory , but they did not follow it , ' '' Prince Andrew continued after a short silence , again quoting Napoleon 's words . '' ' 
I opened my antechambers and they crowded in . ' 
I do not know how far he was justified in saying so . '' 
`` Not in the least , '' replied the vicomte . 
`` After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero . 
If to some people , '' he went on , turning to Anna Pavlovna , `` he ever was a hero , after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth . '' 
Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte 's epigram , Pierre again broke into the conversation , and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate , she was unable to stop him . 
`` The execution of the Duc d'Enghien , '' declared Monsieur Pierre , `` was a political necessity , and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed . '' 
`` Dieu ! 
Mon Dieu ! ''
