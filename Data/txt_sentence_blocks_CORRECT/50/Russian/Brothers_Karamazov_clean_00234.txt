I would n't give it you , because I like you and want to save you , for all you need is the gold mines , the gold mines , the gold mines ! '' 
`` Oh , the devil ! '' 
roared Mitya , and with all his might brought his fist down on the table . 
`` Aie ! 
Aie ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , alarmed , and she flew to the other end of the drawing-room . 
Mitya spat on the ground , and strode rapidly out of the room , out of the house , into the street , into the darkness ! 
He walked like one possessed , and beating himself on the breast , on the spot where he had struck himself two days previously , before Alyosha , the last time he saw him in the dark , on the road . 
What those blows upon his breast signified , on that spot , and what he meant by it - that was , for the time , a secret which was known to no one in the world , and had not been told even to Alyosha . 
But that secret meant for him more than disgrace ; it meant ruin , suicide . 
So he had determined , if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna , and so remove from his breast , from that spot on his breast , the shame he carried upon it , that weighed on his conscience . 
All this will be fully explained to the reader later on , but now that his last hope had vanished , this man , so strong in appearance , burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs ' house . 
He walked on , and not knowing what he was doing , wiped away his tears with his fist . 
In this way he reached the square , and suddenly became aware that he had stumbled against something . 
He heard a piercing wail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down . 
`` Good Lord , you 've nearly killed me ! 
Why do n't you look where you 're going , scapegrace ? '' 
`` Why , it 's you ! '' 
cried Mitya , recognising the old woman in the dark . 
It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov , whom Mitya had particularly noticed the day before . 
`` And who are you , my good sir ? '' 
said the old woman in quite a different voice . 
`` I do n't know you in the dark . '' 
`` You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch 's . 
You 're the servant there ? '' 
`` Just so , sir , I was only running out to Prohoritch 's ... But I do n't know you now . '' 
`` Tell me , my good woman , is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now ? '' 
said Mitya , beside himself with suspense . 
`` I saw her to the house some time ago . '' 
`` She has been there , sir . 
She stayed a little while , and went off again . '' 
`` What ? 
Went away ? '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` When did she go ? '' 
`` Why , as soon as she came . 
She only stayed a minute . 
She only told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh , and then she ran away . '' 
`` You 're lying , damn you ! '' 
roared Mitya . 
`` Aie ! 
Aie ! '' 
shrieked the old woman , but Mitya had vanished . 
He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived . 
At the moment he reached it , Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe . 
It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure . 
Fenya was sitting with her grandmother , the old cook , Matryona , in the kitchen when `` the captain '' ran in . 
Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him . 
`` You scream ? '' 
roared Mitya , `` where is she ? ''
