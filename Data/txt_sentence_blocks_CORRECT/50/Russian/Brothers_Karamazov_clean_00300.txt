Kindly proceed . '' 
Alas ! 
it never entered Mitya 's head to tell them , though he remembered it , that he had jumped back from pity , and standing over the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret : `` You 've come to grief , old man - there 's no help for it . 
Well , there you must lie . '' 
The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion : that the man had jumped back `` at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his crime were dead ; that he must therefore have been a man of great strength , coolness , decision , and foresight even at such a moment , '' ... and so on . 
The prosecutor was satisfied : `` I 've provoked the nervous fellow by ` trifles ' and he has said more than he meant With painful effort Mitya went on . 
But this time he was pulled up immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` How came you to run to the servant , Fedosya Markovna , with your hands so covered with blood , and , as it appears , your face , too ? '' 
`` Why , I did n't notice the blood at all at the time , '' answered Mitya . 
`` That 's quite likely . 
It does happen sometimes . '' 
The prosecutor exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` I simply did n't notice . 
You 're quite right there , prosecutor , '' Mitya assented suddenly . 
Next came the account of Mitya 's sudden determination to `` step aside '' and make way for their happiness . 
But he could not make up his mind to open his heart to them as before , and tell them about `` the queen of his soul . '' 
He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons `` who were fastening on him like bugs . '' 
And so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly : `` Well , I made up my mind to kill myself . 
What had I left to live for ? 
That question stared me in the face . 
Her first rightful lover had come back , the man who wronged her but who 'd hurried back to offer his love , after five years , and atone for the wrong with marriage ... . 
So I knew it was all over for me ... . 
And behind me disgrace , and that blood - Grigory 's ... . 
What had I to live for ? 
So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged , to load them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow . '' 
`` And a grand feast the night before ? '' 
`` Yes , a grand feast the night before . 
Damn it all , gentlemen ! 
Do make haste and finish it . 
I meant to shoot myself not far from here , beyond the village , and I 'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning . 
And I had a note in my pocket already . 
I wrote it at Perhotin 's when I loaded my pistols . 
Here 's the letter . 
Read it ! 
It 's not for you I tell it , '' he added contemptuously . 
He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table . 
The lawyers read it with curiosity , and , as is usual , added it to the papers connected with the case . 
`` And you did n't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin 's ? 
You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion ? '' 
`` What suspicion ? 
Suspicion or not , I should have galloped here just the same , and shot myself at five o'clock , and you would n't have been in time to do anything . 
If it had n't been for what 's happened to my father , you would have known nothing about it , and would n't have come here . 
Oh , it 's the devil 's doing . 
It was the devil murdered father , it was through the devil that you found it out so soon . 
How did you manage to get here so quick ? 
It 's marvellous , a dream ! '' 
`` Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him , you held in your hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a bundle of hundred-rouble notes , and that his servant-boy saw it too . '' 
`` That 's true , gentlemen . 
I remember it was so . '' 
`` Now , there 's one little point presents itself .
