Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself , and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face . 
`` Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today , '' said he , after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable . 
`` Ah , Count Rostov ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre joyfully . 
`` Then you are his son , Ilya ? 
Only fancy , I did n't know you at first . 
Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot ? 
... It 's such an age ... '' `` You are mistaken , '' said Boris deliberately , with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile . 
`` I am Boris , son of Princess Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya . 
Rostov , the father , is Ilya , and his son is Nicholas . 
I never knew any Madame Jacquot . '' 
Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees . 
`` Oh dear , what am I thinking about ? 
I 've mixed everything up . 
One has so many relatives in Moscow ! 
So you are Boris ? 
Of course . 
Well , now we know where we are . 
And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition ? 
The English will come off badly , you know , if Napoleon gets across the Channel . 
I think the expedition is quite feasible . 
If only Villeneuve does n't make a mess of things ! '' 
Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition ; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve 's name . 
`` We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics , '' said he in his quiet ironical tone . 
`` I know nothing about it and have not thought about it . 
Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip , '' he continued . 
`` Just now they are talking about you and your father . '' 
Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion 's sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret . 
But Boris spoke distinctly , clearly , and dryly , looking straight into Pierre 's eyes . 
`` Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip , '' Boris went on . 
`` Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune , though he may perhaps outlive us all , as I sincerely hope he will ... '' `` Yes , it is all very horrid , '' interrupted Pierre , `` very horrid . '' 
Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself . 
`` And it must seem to you , '' said Boris flushing slightly , but not changing his tone or attitude , `` it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man ? '' 
`` So it does , '' thought Pierre . 
`` But I just wish to say , to avoid misunderstandings , that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people . 
We are very poor , but for my own part at any rate , for the very reason that your father is rich , I do n't regard myself as a relation of his , and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him . '' 
For a long time Pierre could not understand , but when he did , he jumped up from the sofa , seized Boris under the elbow in his quick , clumsy way , and , blushing far more than Boris , began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation . 
`` Well , this is strange ! 
Do you suppose I. . . 
who could think ? 
... I know very well ... '' But Boris again interrupted him . 
`` I am glad I have spoken out fully . 
Perhaps you did not like it ? 
You must excuse me , '' said he , putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him , `` but I hope I have not offended you . 
I always make it a rule to speak out ... Well , what answer am I to take ? 
Will you come to dinner at the Rostovs ' ? '' 
And Boris , having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it , became quite pleasant again . 
`` No , but I say , '' said Pierre , calming down , `` you are a wonderful fellow ! 
What you have just said is good , very good . 
Of course you do n't know me .
