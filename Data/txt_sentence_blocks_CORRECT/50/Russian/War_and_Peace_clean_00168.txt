Two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall . 
The servants were bringing in jugs and basins , hot water for shaving , and their well-brushed clothes . 
There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco . 
`` Hallo , Gwiska -- my pipe ! '' 
came Vasili Denisov 's husky voice . 
`` Wostov , get up ! '' 
Rostov , rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together , raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow . 
`` Why , is it late ? '' 
`` Late ! 
It 's nearly ten o'clock , '' answered Natasha 's voice . 
A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls ' voices came from the adjoining room . 
The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue , of ribbons , black hair , and merry faces . 
It was Natasha , Sonya , and Petya , who had come to see whether they were getting up . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Get up ! '' 
Natasha 's voice was again heard at the door . 
`` Directly ! '' 
Meanwhile , Petya , having found and seized the sabers in the outer room , with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother , and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed , opened the bedroom door . 
`` Is this your saber ? '' 
he shouted . 
The girls sprang aside . 
Denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket , looking with a scared face at his comrade for help . 
The door , having let Petya in , closed again . 
A sound of laughter came from behind it . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Come out in your dressing gown ! '' 
said Natasha 's voice . 
`` Is this your saber ? '' 
asked Petya . 
`` Or is it yours ? '' 
he said , addressing the black-mustached Denisov with servile deference . 
Rostov hurriedly put something on his feet , drew on his dressing gown , and went out . 
Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other . 
Sonya , when he came in , was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down . 
They were dressed alike , in new pale-blue frocks , and were both fresh , rosy , and bright . 
Sonya ran away , but Natasha , taking her brother 's arm , led him into the sitting room , where they began talking . 
They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves . 
Natasha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself , not because what they were saying was amusing , but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter . 
`` Oh , how nice , how splendid ! '' 
she said to everything . 
Rostov felt that , under the influence of the warm rays of love , that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face . 
`` No , but listen , '' she said , `` now you are quite a man , are n't you ? 
I 'm awfully glad you 're my brother . '' 
She touched his mustache . 
`` I want to know what you men are like . 
Are you the same as we ? 
No ? '' 
`` Why did Sonya run away ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Ah , yes !
