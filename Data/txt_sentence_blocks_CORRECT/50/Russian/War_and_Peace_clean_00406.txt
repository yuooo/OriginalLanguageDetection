`` The Elder ? 
What do you want with him ? 
... '' asked Karp . 
But before the words were well out of his mouth , his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side . 
`` Caps off , traitors ! '' 
shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
he cried furiously . 
`` The Elder ... . 
He wants the Elder ! 
... Dron Zakharych , you ! '' 
meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads . 
`` We do n't riot , we 're following the orders , '' declared Karp , and at that moment several voices began speaking together . 
`` It 's as the old men have decided -- there 's too many of you giving orders . '' 
`` Arguing ? 
Mutiny ! 
... Brigands ! 
Traitors ! '' 
cried Rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own , gripping Karp by the collar . 
`` Bind him , bind him ! '' 
he shouted , though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych . 
Lavrushka , however , ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind . 
`` Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill ? '' 
he called out . 
Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp . 
The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
demanded Rostov in a loud voice . 
With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd . 
`` Are you the Elder ? 
Bind him , Lavrushka ! '' 
shouted Rostov , as if that order , too , could not possibly meet with any opposition . 
And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron , who took off his own belt and handed it to them , as if to aid them . 
`` And you all listen to me ! '' 
said Rostov to the peasants . 
`` Be off to your houses at once , and do n't let one of your voices be heard ! '' 
`` Why , we 've not done any harm ! 
We did it just out of foolishness . 
It 's all nonsense ... I said then that it was not in order , '' voices were heard bickering with one another . 
`` There ! 
What did I say ? '' 
said Alpatych , coming into his own again . 
`` It 's wrong , lads ! '' 
`` All our stupidity , Yakov Alpatych , '' came the answers , and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village . 
The two bound men were led off to the master 's house . 
The two drunken peasants followed them . 
`` Aye , when I look at you ! 
... '' said one of them to Karp . 
`` How can one talk to the masters like that ? 
What were you thinking of , you fool ? ''
