`` He 's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg , '' he added . 
`` The hoof 's cracked ! 
That 's nothing . 
I 'll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use . '' 
`` Yes , please do , '' said Rostov . 
`` I 'll show you , I 'll show you ! 
It 's not a secret . 
And it 's a horse you 'll thank me for . '' 
`` Then I 'll have it brought round , '' said Rostov wishing to avoid Telyanin , and he went out to give the order . 
In the passage Denisov , with a pipe , was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him . 
On seeing Rostov , Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting , he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust . 
`` Ugh ! 
I do n't like that fellow , '' he said , regardless of the quartermaster 's presence . 
Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say : `` Nor do I , but what 's one to do ? '' 
and , having given his order , he returned to Telyanin . 
Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left him , rubbing his small white hands . 
`` Well there certainly are disgusting people , '' thought Rostov as he entered . 
`` Have you told them to bring the horse ? '' 
asked Telyanin , getting up and looking carelessly about him . 
`` I have . '' 
`` Let us go ourselves . 
I only came round to ask Denisov about yesterday 's order . 
Have you got it , Denisov ? '' 
`` Not yet . 
But where are you off to ? '' 
`` I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse , '' said Telyanin . 
They went through the porch and into the stable . 
The lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters . 
When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table . 
Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper . 
He looked gloomily in Rostov 's face and said : `` I am witing to her . '' 
He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and , evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write , told Rostov the contents of his letter . 
`` You see , my fwiend , '' he said , `` we sleep when we do n't love . 
We are childwen of the dust ... but one falls in love and one is a God , one is pua ' as on the first day of cweation ... Who 's that now ? 
Send him to the devil , I 'm busy ! '' 
he shouted to Lavrushka , who went up to him not in the least abashed . 
`` Who should it be ? 
You yourself told him to come . 
It 's the quartermaster for the money . '' 
Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped . 
`` Wetched business , '' he muttered to himself . 
`` How much is left in the puhse ? '' 
he asked , turning to Rostov . 
`` Seven new and three old imperials . '' 
`` Oh , it 's wetched ! 
Well , what are you standing there for , you sca ` cwow ? 
Call the quahtehmasteh , '' he shouted to Lavrushka . 
`` Please , Denisov , let me lend you some : I have some , you know , '' said Rostov , blushing . 
`` Do n't like bowwowing from my own fellows , I do n't , '' growled Denisov . 
`` But if you wo n't accept money from me like a comrade , you will offend me .
