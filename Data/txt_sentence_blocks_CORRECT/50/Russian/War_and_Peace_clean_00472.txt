The whole household , servants included , was bright and animated . 
Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time . 
`` What could we fasten this onto ? '' 
asked the servants , trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage . 
`` We must keep at least one cart . '' 
`` What 's in it ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` The count 's books . '' 
`` Leave it , Vasilich will put it away . 
It 's not wanted . '' 
The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count Peter could sit . 
`` On the box . 
You 'll sit on the box , wo n't you , Petya ? '' 
cried Natasha . 
Sonya too was busy all this time , but the aim of her efforts was quite different from Natasha 's . 
She was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished , and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible . 
Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs ' four carriages , packed full and with the horses harnessed , stood at the front door . 
One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard . 
The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya 's attention as it passed the front porch . 
With the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance . 
`` Whose caleche is that ? '' 
she inquired , leaning out of the carriage window . 
`` Why , did n't you know , Miss ? '' 
replied the maid . 
`` The wounded prince : he spent the night in our house and is going with us . '' 
`` But who is it ? 
What 's his name ? '' 
`` It 's our intended that was -- Prince Bolkonski himself ! 
They say he is dying , '' replied the maid with a sigh . 
Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess . 
The countess , tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey , was pacing up and down the drawing room , waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting . 
Natasha was not in the room . 
`` Mamma , '' said Sonya , `` Prince Andrew is here , mortally wounded . 
He is going with us . '' 
The countess opened her eyes in dismay and , seizing Sonya 's arm , glanced around . 
`` Natasha ? '' 
she murmured . 
At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them . 
They knew their Natasha , and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked . 
`` Natasha does not know yet , but he is going with us , '' said Sonya . 
`` You say he is dying ? '' 
Sonya nodded . 
The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry . 
`` The ways of God are past finding out ! '' 
she thought , feeling that the Almighty Hand , hitherto unseen , was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place . 
`` Well , Mamma ? 
Everything is ready . 
What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Natasha , as with animated face she ran into the room . 
`` Nothing , '' answered the countess .
