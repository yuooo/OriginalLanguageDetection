Je vous en conjure ... '' The princess did not reply . 
Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible , but it was evident that if the princess did speak , her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikhaylovna . 
Though the latter held on tenaciously , her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness . 
`` Pierre , my dear , come here . 
I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation ; is it not so , Prince ? '' 
`` Why do n't you speak , cousin ? '' 
suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled . 
`` Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere , making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man 's room ? 
Intriguer ! '' 
she hissed viciously , and tugged with all her might at the portfolio . 
But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio , and changed her grip . 
Prince Vasili rose . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he with reproach and surprise , `` this is absurd ! 
Come , let go I tell you . '' 
The princess let go . 
`` And you too ! '' 
But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him . 
`` Let go , I tell you ! 
I will take the responsibility . 
I myself will go and ask him , I ! 
... does that satisfy you ? '' 
`` But , Prince , '' said Anna Mikhaylovna , `` after such a solemn sacrament , allow him a moment 's peace ! 
Here , Pierre , tell them your opinion , '' said she , turning to the young man who , having come quite close , was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity , and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasili . 
`` Remember that you will answer for the consequences , '' said Prince Vasili severely . 
`` You do n't know what you are doing . '' 
`` Vile woman ! '' 
shouted the princess , darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her . 
Prince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands . 
At this moment that terrible door , which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly , burst noisily open and banged against the wall , and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands . 
`` What are you doing ! '' 
she cried vehemently . 
`` He is dying and you leave me alone with him ! '' 
Her sister dropped the portfolio . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , stooping , quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom . 
The eldest princess and Prince Vasili , recovering themselves , followed her . 
A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face , again biting her underlip . 
At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred . 
`` Yes , now you may be glad ! '' 
said she ; `` this is what you have been waiting for . '' 
And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room . 
Prince Vasili came next . 
He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it , covering his face with his hand . 
Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague . 
`` Ah , my friend ! '' 
said he , taking Pierre by the elbow ; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before . 
`` How often we sin , how much we deceive , and all for what ? 
I am near sixty , dear friend ... I too ... All will end in death , all ! 
Death is awful ... '' and he burst into tears . 
Anna Mikhaylovna came out last .
