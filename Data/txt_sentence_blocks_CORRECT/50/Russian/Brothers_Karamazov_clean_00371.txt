You never lie to me , do n't lie now ; is it true ? 
You are not laughing ? '' 
`` It 's true . '' 
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent . 
`` Alyosha , come and see me , come and see me more often , '' she said suddenly , in a supplicating voice . 
`` I 'll always come to see you , all my life , '' answered Alyosha firmly . 
`` You are the only person I can talk to , you know , '' Lise began again . 
`` I talk to no one but myself and you . 
Only you in the whole world . 
And to you more readily than to myself . 
And I am not a bit ashamed with you , not a bit . 
Alyosha , why am I not ashamed with you , not a bit ? 
Alyosha , is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` There 's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew , who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands , and then crucified him on the wall , hammered nails into him and crucified him , and afterwards , when he was tried , he said that the child died soon , within four hours . 
That was ` soon ' ! 
He said the child moaned , kept on moaning and he stood admiring it . 
That 's nice ! '' 
`` Nice ? '' 
`` Nice ; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him . 
He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple compote . 
I am awfully fond of pineapple compote . 
Do you like it ? '' 
Alyosha looked at her in silence . 
Her pale , sallow face was suddenly contorted , her eyes burned . 
`` You know , when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night . 
I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned -LRB- a child of four years old understands , you know -RRB- , and all the while the thought of pineapple compote haunted me . 
In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person , begging him particularly to come and see me . 
He came and I suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple compote . 
All about it , all , and said that it was nice . 
He laughed and said it really was nice . 
Then he got up and went away . 
He was only here five minutes . 
Did he despise me ? 
Did he despise me ? 
Tell me , tell me , Alyosha , did he despise me or not ? '' 
She sat up on the couch , with flashing eyes . 
`` Tell me , '' Alyosha asked anxiously , `` did you send for that person ? '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` Did you send him a letter ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Simply to ask about that , about that child ? '' 
`` No , not about that at all . 
But when he came , I asked him about that at once . 
He answered , laughed , got up and went away . '' 
`` That person behaved honourably , '' Alyosha murmured . 
`` And did he despise me ? 
Did he laugh at me ? '' 
`` No , for perhaps he believes in the pineapple compote himself . 
He is very ill now , too , Lise . ''
