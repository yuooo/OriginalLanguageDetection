Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room , and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness . 
`` What is it you are afraid of , Lise ? 
I do n't understand , '' said he . 
`` There , what egotists men all are : all , all egotists ! 
Just for a whim of his own , goodness only knows why , he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country . '' 
`` With my father and sister , remember , '' said Prince Andrew gently . 
`` Alone all the same , without my friends ... . 
And he expects me not to be afraid . '' 
Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up , giving her not a joyful , but an animal , squirrel-like expression . 
She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre , though the gist of the matter lay in that . 
`` I still ca n't understand what you are afraid of , '' said Prince Andrew slowly , not taking his eyes off his wife . 
The princess blushed , and raised her arms with a gesture of despair . 
`` No , Andrew , I must say you have changed . 
Oh , how you have ... '' `` Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` You had better go . '' 
The princess said nothing , but suddenly her short downy lip quivered . 
Prince Andrew rose , shrugged his shoulders , and walked about the room . 
Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise , now at him and now at her , moved as if about to rise too , but changed his mind . 
`` Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here ? '' 
exclaimed the little princess suddenly , her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace . 
`` I have long wanted to ask you , Andrew , why you have changed so to me ? 
What have I done to you ? 
You are going to the war and have no pity for me . 
Why is it ? '' 
`` Lise ! '' 
was all Prince Andrew said . 
But that one word expressed an entreaty , a threat , and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words . 
But she went on hurriedly : `` You treat me like an invalid or a child . 
I see it all ! 
Did you behave like that six months ago ? '' 
`` Lise , I beg you to desist , '' said Prince Andrew still more emphatically . 
Pierre , who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this , rose and approached the princess . 
He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself . 
`` Calm yourself , Princess ! 
It seems so to you because ... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No , excuse me ! 
An outsider is out of place here ... No , do n't distress yourself ... Good-by ! '' 
Prince Andrew caught him by the hand . 
`` No , wait , Pierre ! 
The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you . '' 
`` No , he thinks only of himself , '' muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears . 
`` Lise ! '' 
said Prince Andrew dryly , raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted . 
Suddenly the angry , squirrel-like expression of the princess ' pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear . 
Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband 's face , and her own assumed the timid , deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail . 
`` Mon Dieu , mon Dieu ! '' 
she muttered , and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead . 
`` Good night , Lise , '' said he , rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger . 
The friends were silent . 
Neither cared to begin talking . 
Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew ; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand .
