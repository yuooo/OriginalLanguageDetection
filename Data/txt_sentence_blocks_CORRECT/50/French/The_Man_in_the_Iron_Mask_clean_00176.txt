`` You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not any , I assure you , my dear captain ; for , in fact , I have done nothing , no more has Aramis , '' the worthy baron hastened to say . 
D'Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate , which penetrated that hardened heart . 
`` Dear Porthos ! '' 
cried the bishop of Vannes . 
`` You see what is being done against you , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` interception of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle . 
Your means of transport seized . 
If you had endeavored to fly , you would have fallen into the hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions , on the watch for you . 
The king wants you to be taken , and he will take you . '' 
D'Artagnan tore at his gray mustache . 
Aramis grew somber , Porthos angry . 
`` My idea was this , '' continued D'Artagnan : `` to make you both come on board , to keep you near me , and restore you your liberty . 
But now , who can say , when I return to my ship , I may not find a superior ; that I may not find secret orders which will take from me my command , and give it to another , who will dispose of me and you without hope of help ? '' 
`` We must remain at Belle-Isle , '' said Aramis , resolutely ; `` and I assure you , for my part , I will not surrender easily . '' 
Porthos said nothing . 
D'Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend . 
`` I have another trial to make of this officer , of this brave fellow who accompanies me , and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy ; for it denotes an honest man , who , though an enemy , is a thousand times better than a complaisant coward . 
Let us try to learn from him what his instructions are , and what his orders permit or forbid . '' 
`` Let us try , '' said Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went to the parapet , leaned over towards the steps of the mole , and called the officer , who immediately came up . 
`` Monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other , `` monsieur , if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here , what would you do ? '' 
`` I should not oppose it , monsieur ; but having direct explicit orders to put them under guard , I should detain them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` That 's all over , '' said Aramis , gloomily . 
Porthos did not stir . 
`` But still take Porthos , '' said the bishop of Vannes . 
`` He can prove to the king , and I will help him do so , and you too , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that he had nothing to do with this affair . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Will you come ? 
Will you follow me , Porthos ? 
The king is merciful . '' 
`` I want time for reflection , '' said Porthos . 
`` You will remain here , then ? '' 
`` Until fresh orders , '' said Aramis , with vivacity . 
`` Until we have an idea , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` and I now believe that will not be long , for I have one already . '' 
`` Let us say adieu , then , '' said Aramis ; `` but in truth , my good Porthos , you ought to go . '' 
`` No , '' said the latter , laconically . 
`` As you please , '' replied Aramis , a little wounded in his susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion . 
`` Only I am reassured by the promise of an idea from D'Artagnan , an idea I fancy I have divined . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the musketeer , placing his ear near Aramis 's mouth . 
The latter spoke several words rapidly , to which D'Artagnan replied , `` That is it , precisely . '' 
`` Infallible ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` During the first emotion this resolution will cause , take care of yourself , Aramis . '' 
`` Oh ! 
do n't be afraid . '' 
`` Now , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan to the officer , `` thanks , a thousand thanks ! 
You have made yourself three friends for life . ''
