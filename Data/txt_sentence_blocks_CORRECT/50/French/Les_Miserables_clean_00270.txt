She had neither eaten nor slept . 
The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions , without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze . 
Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days . 
She divined that they were passing through a crisis . 
She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to `` be good . '' 
Who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words , pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being : Say nothing ! 
Fear is mute . 
Moreover , no one guards a secret like a child . 
But when , at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours , she beheld Jean Valjean again , she gave vent to such a cry of joy , that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry , would have guessed that it issued from an abyss . 
Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words . 
All the doors opened . 
Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in . 
The porter , who had received his instructions , opened the little servant 's door which connected the courtyard with the garden , and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago , in the wall at the bottom of the court , which faced the carriage entrance . 
The porter admitted all three of them through this door , and from that point they reached the inner , reserved parlor where Fauchelevent , on the preceding day , had received his orders from the prioress . 
The prioress , rosary in hand , was waiting for them . 
A vocal mother , with her veil lowered , stood beside her . 
A discreet candle lighted , one might almost say , made a show of lighting the parlor . 
The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review . 
There is nothing which examines like a downcast eye . 
Then she questioned him : -- `` You are the brother ? '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother , '' replied Fauchelevent . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Ultime Fauchelevent . '' 
He really had had a brother named Ultime , who was dead . 
`` Where do you come from ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` From Picquigny , near Amiens . '' 
`` What is your age ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Fifty . '' 
`` What is your profession ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Gardener . '' 
`` Are you a good Christian ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Every one is in the family . '' 
`` Is this your little girl ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` You are her father ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Her grandfather . '' 
The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice `` He answers well . '' 
Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word . 
The prioress looked attentively at Cosette , and said half aloud to the vocal mother : -- `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor , then the prioress turned round and said : -- `` Father Fauvent , you will get another knee-cap with a bell . 
Two will be required now . '' 
On the following day , therefore , two bells were audible in the garden , and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils . 
At the extreme end of the garden , under the trees , two men , Fauvent and another man , were visible as they dug side by side . 
An enormous event . 
Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other : `` He is an assistant gardener . '' 
The vocal mothers added : `` He is a brother of Father Fauvent . '' 
Jean Valjean was , in fact , regularly installed ; he had his belled knee-cap ; henceforth he was official . 
His name was Ultime Fauchelevent . 
The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress 's observation upon Cosette : `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The prioress , that pronounced prognosticator , immediately took a fancy to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil .
