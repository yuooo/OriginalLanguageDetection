`` See if M. d'Artagnan has returned . '' 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` It is very strange , '' murmured the king . 
`` Call M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert entered ; he had been expecting this all the morning . 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' said the king , very sharply ; `` you must ascertain what has become of M. d'Artagnan . '' 
Colbert in his calm voice replied , `` Where does your majesty desire him to be sought for ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur ! 
do you not know on what I have sent him ? '' 
replied Louis , acrimoniously . 
`` Your majesty did not inform me . '' 
`` Monsieur , there are things that must be guessed ; and you , above all , are apt to guess them . '' 
`` I might have been able to imagine , sire ; but I do not presume to be positive . '' 
Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the monarch and his clerk . 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , with evident joy . 
D'Artagnan , pale and in evidently bad humor , cried to the king , as he entered , `` Sire , is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
said the king . 
`` About M. Fouquet 's house ? '' 
`` None ! '' 
replied Louis . 
`` Ha ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , biting his mustache ; `` I was not mistaken , then ; it was monsieur here ; '' and he pointed to Colbert . 
`` What orders ? 
Let me know , '' said the king . 
`` Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy , to beat M. Fouquet 's servants , to force the drawers , to give over a peaceful house to pillage ! 
Mordioux ! 
these are savage orders ! '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert , turning pale . 
`` Monsieur , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` the king alone , understand , - the king alone has a right to command my musketeers ; but , as to you , I forbid you to do it , and I tell you so before his majesty ; gentlemen who carry swords do not sling pens behind their ears . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! 
D'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` It is humiliating , '' continued the musketeer ; `` my soldiers are disgraced . 
I do not command reitres , thank you , nor clerks of the intendant , mordioux ! '' 
`` Well ! 
but what is all this about ? '' 
said the king with authority . 
`` About this , sire ; monsieur - monsieur , who could not guess your majesty 's orders , and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M. Fouquet ; monsieur , who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for his patron of yesterday - has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of M. Fouquet , and , under the pretense of securing the surintendant 's papers , they have taken away the furniture . 
My musketeers have been posted round the house all the morning ; such were my orders . 
Why did any one presume to order them to enter ? 
Why , by forcing them to assist in this pillage , have they been made accomplices in it ? 
Mordioux ! 
we serve the king , we do ; but we do not serve M. Colbert ! '' 
-LRB- 5 -RRB- `` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the king , sternly , `` take care ; it is not in my presence that such explanations , and made in such a tone , should take place . '' 
`` I have acted for the good of the king , '' said Colbert , in a faltering voice . 
`` It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty 's officers , and that without redress , on account of the respect I owe the king . ''
