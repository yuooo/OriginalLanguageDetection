`` He has not made his appearance since yesterday . 
Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us ? '' 
`` Without you , madam ? '' 
answered the detective . 
`` Excuse me , did you intend to sail in the Carnatic ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed . 
The Carnatic , its repairs being completed , left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time , without any notice being given ; and we must now wait a week for another steamer . '' 
As he said `` a week '' Fix felt his heart leap for joy . 
Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week ! 
There would be time for the warrant to arrive , and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law . 
His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say , in his placid voice , `` But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic , it seems to me , in the harbour of Hong Kong . '' 
And , offering his arm to Aouda , he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start . 
Fix , stupefied , followed ; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread . 
Chance , however , appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well . 
For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks , with the determination , if necessary , to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama ; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading , and which could not therefore set sail . 
Fix began to hope again . 
But Mr. Fogg , far from being discouraged , was continuing his search , resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao , when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves . 
`` Is your honour looking for a boat ? '' 
`` Have you a boat ready to sail ? '' 
`` Yes , your honour ; a pilot-boat -- No. 43 -- the best in the harbour . '' 
`` Does she go fast ? '' 
`` Between eight and nine knots the hour . 
Will you look at her ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Your honour will be satisfied with her . 
Is it for a sea excursion ? '' 
`` No ; for a voyage . '' 
`` A voyage ? '' 
`` Yes , will you agree to take me to Yokohama ? '' 
The sailor leaned on the railing , opened his eyes wide , and said , `` Is your honour joking ? '' 
`` No . 
I have missed the Carnatic , and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest , to take the boat for San Francisco . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the sailor ; `` but it is impossible . '' 
`` I offer you a hundred pounds per day , and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time . '' 
`` Are you in earnest ? '' 
`` Very much so . '' 
The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far . 
Fix was in mortal suspense . 
Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her , `` You would not be afraid , would you , madam ? '' 
`` Not with you , Mr. Fogg , '' was her answer . 
The pilot now returned , shuffling his hat in his hands . 
`` Well , pilot ? '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Well , your honour , '' replied he , `` I could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year . 
Besides , we could not reach Yokohama in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong . '' 
`` Only sixteen hundred , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the same thing . '' 
Fix breathed more freely . 
`` But , '' added the pilot , `` it might be arranged another way . ''
