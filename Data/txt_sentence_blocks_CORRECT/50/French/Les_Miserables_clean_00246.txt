The prayers of the forty hours are being said . 
The whole community is in confusion . 
That occupies them . 
The one who is on the point of departure is a saint . 
In fact , we are all saints here ; all the difference between them and me is that they say ` our cell , ' and that I say ` my cabin . ' 
The prayers for the dying are to be said , and then the prayers for the dead . 
We shall be at peace here for to-day ; but I will not answer for to-morrow . '' 
`` Still , '' observed Jean Valjean , `` this cottage is in the niche of the wall , it is hidden by a sort of ruin , there are trees , it is not visible from the convent . '' 
`` And I add that the nuns never come near it . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
The interrogation mark which accentuated this `` well '' signified : `` it seems to me that one may remain concealed here ? '' 
It was to this interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded : -- `` There are the little girls . '' 
`` What little girls ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered , a bell emitted one stroke . 
`` The nun is dead , '' said he . 
`` There is the knell . '' 
And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen . 
The bell struck a second time . 
`` It is the knell , Monsieur Madeleine . 
The bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty-four hours , until the body is taken from the church . 
-- You see , they play . 
At recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside , to send them all hither , in spite of prohibitions , to hunt and rummage for it all about here . 
Those cherubs are devils . '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
`` The little girls . 
You would be very quickly discovered . 
They would shriek : ` Oh ! 
a man ! ' 
There is no danger to-day . 
There will be no recreation hour . 
The day will be entirely devoted to prayers . 
You hear the bell . 
As I told you , a stroke each minute . 
It is the death knell . '' 
`` I understand , Father Fauchelevent . 
There are pupils . '' 
And Jean Valjean thought to himself : -- `` Here is Cosette 's education already provided . '' 
Fauchelevent exclaimed : -- `` Pardine ! 
There are little girls indeed ! 
And they would bawl around you ! 
And they would rush off ! 
To be a man here is to have the plague . 
You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast . '' 
Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought . 
-- `` This convent would be our salvation , '' he murmured . 
Then he raised his voice : -- `` Yes , the difficulty is to remain here . '' 
`` No , '' said Fauchelevent , `` the difficulty is to get out . ''
