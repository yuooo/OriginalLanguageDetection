Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind . 
His twin plots , the one with the nuns , the one for the convent , the other against it , the other with M. Madeleine , had succeeded , to all appearance . 
Jean Valjean 's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious . 
Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success . 
What remained to be done was a mere nothing . 
Within the last two years , he had made good Father Mestienne , a chubby-cheeked person , drunk at least ten times . 
He played with Father Mestienne . 
He did what he liked with him . 
He made him dance according to his whim . 
Mestienne 's head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent 's will . 
Fauchelevent 's confidence was perfect . 
At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery , Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse , and said half aloud , as he rubbed his big hands : -- `` Here 's a fine farce ! '' 
All at once the hearse halted ; it had reached the gate . 
The permission for interment must be exhibited . 
The undertaker 's man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery . 
During this colloquy , which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes , some one , a stranger , came and placed himself behind the hearse , beside Fauchelevent . 
He was a sort of laboring man , who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm . 
Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
he demanded . 
`` The man replied : -- `` The grave-digger . '' 
If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast , he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made . 
`` The grave-digger ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You ? '' 
`` I. '' `` Father Mestienne is the grave-digger . '' 
`` He was . '' 
`` What ! 
He was ? '' 
`` He is dead . '' 
Fauchelevent had expected anything but this , that a grave-digger could die . 
It is true , nevertheless , that grave-diggers do die themselves . 
By dint of excavating graves for other people , one hollows out one 's own . 
Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open . 
He had hardly the strength to stammer : -- `` But it is not possible ! '' 
`` It is so . '' 
`` But , '' he persisted feebly , `` Father Mestienne is the grave-digger . '' 
`` After Napoleon , Louis XVIII . 
After Mestienne , Gribier . 
Peasant , my name is Gribier . '' 
Fauchelevent , who was deadly pale , stared at this Gribier . 
He was a tall , thin , livid , utterly funereal man . 
He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger . 
Fauchelevent burst out laughing . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said he , `` what queer things do happen ! 
Father Mestienne is dead , but long live little Father Lenoir ! 
Do you know who little Father Lenoir is ? 
He is a jug of red wine . 
It is a jug of Surene , morbigou !
