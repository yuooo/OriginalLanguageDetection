What did I say ? 
Duds ! 
No money ! 
They are all alike ! 
By the way , how was the letter to that old blockhead signed ? '' 
`` Fabantou , '' replied the girl . 
`` The dramatic artist , good ! '' 
It was lucky for Jondrette , that this had occurred to him , for at the very moment , M. Leblanc turned to him , and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name : -- `` I see that you are greatly to be pitied , Monsieur -- '' `` Fabantou , '' replied Jondrette quickly . 
`` Monsieur Fabantou , yes , that is it . 
I remember . '' 
`` Dramatic artist , sir , and one who has had some success . '' 
Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the `` philanthropist . '' 
He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs , and the humility of the mendicant on the highway : -- `` A pupil of Talma ! 
Sir ! 
I am a pupil of Talma ! 
Fortune formerly smiled on me -- Alas ! 
Now it is misfortune 's turn . 
You see , my benefactor , no bread , no fire . 
My poor babes have no fire ! 
My only chair has no seat ! 
A broken pane ! 
And in such weather ! 
My spouse in bed ! 
Ill ! '' 
`` Poor woman ! '' 
said M. Leblanc . 
`` My child wounded ! '' 
added Jondrette . 
The child , diverted by the arrival of the strangers , had fallen to contemplating `` the young lady , '' and had ceased to sob . 
`` Cry ! 
bawl ! '' 
said Jondrette to her in a low voice . 
At the same time he pinched her sore hand . 
All this was done with the talent of a juggler . 
The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks . 
The adorable young girl , whom Marius , in his heart , called `` his Ursule , '' approached her hastily . 
`` Poor , dear child ! '' 
said she . 
`` You see , my beautiful young lady , '' pursued Jondrette `` her bleeding wrist ! 
It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day . 
It may be necessary to cut off her arm . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
said the old gentleman , in alarm . 
The little girl , taking this seriously , fell to sobbing more violently than ever . 
`` Alas ! 
yes , my benefactor ! '' 
replied the father . 
For several minutes , Jondrette had been scrutinizing `` the benefactor '' in a singular fashion . 
As he spoke , he seemed to be examining the other attentively , as though seeking to summon up his recollections . 
All at once , profiting by a moment when the new-comers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand , he passed near his wife , who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air , and said to her in a rapid but very low tone : -- `` Take a look at that man ! ''
