Their masters must not enter . '' 
`` That is clear , '' said Porthos . 
`` You understand , '' added Aramis , with the rapid precision of command ; `` there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under which the fox has glided - but at the too narrow opening of which they must be themselves stopped and killed . '' 
The Bretons sprang forward , knife in hand . 
In a few minutes there was a lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls - and then , silence . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
said Aramis , coolly , `` now for the masters ! '' 
`` What is to be done with them ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Wait their arrival , conceal ourselves , and kill them . '' 
`` Kill them ! '' 
replied Porthos . 
`` There are sixteen , '' said Aramis , `` at least , at present . '' 
`` And well armed , '' added Porthos , with a smile of consolation . 
`` It will last about ten minutes , '' said Aramis . 
`` To work ! '' 
And with a resolute air he took up a musket , and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth . 
`` Yves , Goenne , and his son , '' continued Aramis , will pass the muskets to us . 
You , Porthos , will fire when they are close . 
We shall have brought down , at the lowest computation , eight , before the others are aware of anything - that is certain ; then all , there are five of us , will dispatch the other eight , knife in hand . '' 
`` And poor Biscarrat ? '' 
said Porthos . 
Aramis reflected a moment - `` Biscarrat first , '' replied he , coolly . 
`` He knows us . '' 
: The Grotto . 
In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the character of Aramis , the event , subject to the risks of things over which uncertainty presides , did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had foreseen . 
Biscarrat , better mounted than his companions , arrived first at the opening of the grotto , and comprehended that fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it . 
Only , struck by that superstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man , he stopped at the outside of the grotto , and waited till his companions should have assembled round him . 
`` Well ! '' 
asked the young men , coming up , out of breath , and unable to understand the meaning of this inaction . 
`` Well ! 
I can not hear the dogs ; they and the fox must all be lost in this infernal cavern . '' 
`` They were too close up , '' said one of the guards , `` to have lost scent all at once . 
Besides , we should hear them from one side or another . 
They must , as Biscarrat says , be in this grotto . '' 
`` But then , '' said one of the young men , `` why do n't they give tongue ? '' 
`` It is strange ! '' 
muttered another . 
`` Well , but , '' said a fourth , `` let us go into this grotto . 
Does it happen to be forbidden we should enter it ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat . 
`` Only , as it looks as dark as a wolf 's mouth , we might break our necks in it . '' 
`` Witness the dogs , '' said a guard , `` who seem to have broken theirs . '' 
`` What the devil can have become of them ? '' 
asked the young men in chorus . 
And every master called his dog by his name , whistled to him in his favorite mode , without a single one replying to either call or whistle . 
`` It is perhaps an enchanted grotto , '' said Biscarrat ; `` let us see . '' 
And , jumping from his horse , he made a step into the grotto . 
`` Stop ! 
stop !
