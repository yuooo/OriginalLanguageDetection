They are on earth now . '' 
But this confusion vanished ; a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly ; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage . 
By the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle . 
It was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse . 
The noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse 's hoofs on the pavement . 
`` What vehicle is this ? '' 
he said to himself . 
`` Who is coming here so early in the morning ? '' 
At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber . 
He shuddered from head to foot , and cried in a terrible voice : -- `` Who is there ? '' 
Some one said : -- `` I , Monsieur le Maire . '' 
He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress . 
`` Well ! '' 
he replied , `` what is it ? '' 
`` Monsieur le Maire , it is just five o'clock in the morning . '' 
`` What is that to me ? '' 
`` The cabriolet is here , Monsieur le Maire . '' 
`` What cabriolet ? '' 
`` The tilbury . '' 
`` What tilbury ? '' 
`` Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury ? '' 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire . '' 
`` What coachman ? '' 
`` M. Scaufflaire 's coachman . '' 
`` M. Scaufflaire ? '' 
That name sent a shudder over him , as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face . 
`` Ah ! 
yes , '' he resumed ; `` M. Scaufflaire ! '' 
If the old woman could have seen him at that moment , she would have been frightened . 
A tolerably long silence ensued . 
He examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air , and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax , which he rolled between his fingers . 
The old woman waited for him . 
She even ventured to uplift her voice once more : -- `` What am I to say , Monsieur le Maire ? '' 
`` Say that it is well , and that I am coming down . '' 
HINDRANCES The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire . 
These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets , upholstered inside with fawn-colored leather , hung on springs , and having but two seats , one for the postboy , the other for the traveller . 
The wheels were armed with those long , offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance , and which may still be seen on the road in Germany . 
The despatch box , an immense oblong coffer , was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it . 
This coffer was painted black , and the cabriolet yellow . 
These vehicles , which have no counterparts nowadays , had something distorted and hunchbacked about them ; and when one saw them passing in the distance , and climbing up some road to the horizon , they resembled the insects which are called , I think , termites , and which , though with but little corselet , drag a great train behind them . 
But they travelled at a very rapid rate . 
The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o'clock every night , after the mail from Paris had passed , arrived at M. sur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning . 
That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road , collided at the corner of a street , just as it was entering the town , with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse , which was going in the opposite direction , and in which there was but one person , a man enveloped in a mantle . 
The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock . 
The postman shouted to the man to stop , but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop . 
`` That man is in a devilish hurry ! '' 
said the postman . 
The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity . 
Whither was he going ?
