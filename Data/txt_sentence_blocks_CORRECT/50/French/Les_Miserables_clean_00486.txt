He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore , her knot of ribbon , her gloves , her sleeves , her shoes , her cuffs , as sacred objects of which he was the master . 
He dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair , and he even said to himself , in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light , that there was not a ribbon of her gown , not a mesh in her stockings , not a fold in her bodice , which was not his . 
Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property , his own thing , his own despot and his slave . 
It seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls , that it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again . 
-- `` This is mine . '' 
`` No , it is mine . '' 
`` I assure you that you are mistaken . 
This is my property . '' 
`` What you are taking as your own is myself . '' 
-- Marius was something that made a part of Cosette , and Cosette was something which made a part of Marius . 
Marius felt Cosette within him . 
To have Cosette , to possess Cosette , this , to him , was not to be distinguished from breathing . 
It was in the midst of this faith , of this intoxication , of this virgin possession , unprecedented and absolute , of this sovereignty , that these words : `` We are going away , '' fell suddenly , at a blow , and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him : `` Cosette is not yours ! '' 
Marius awoke . 
For six weeks Marius had been living , as we have said , outside of life ; those words , going away ! 
caused him to re-enter it harshly . 
He found not a word to say . 
Cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold . 
She said to him in her turn : `` What is the matter ? '' 
He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him : -- `` I did not understand what you said . '' 
She began again : -- `` This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness , that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk , that he was obliged to go on a journey , that we were to go away , that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him , and that all is to be ready in a week from now , and that we might go to England . '' 
`` But this is outrageous ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
It is certain , that , at that moment , no abuse of power , no violence , not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants , no action of Busiris , of Tiberius , or of Henry VIII. , could have equalled this in atrocity , in the opinion of Marius ; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to England because he had business there . 
He demanded in a weak voice : -- `` And when do you start ? '' 
`` He did not say when . '' 
`` And when shall you return ? '' 
`` He did not say when . '' 
Marius rose and said coldly : -- `` Cosette , shall you go ? '' 
Cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes , all filled with anguish , and replied in a sort of bewilderment : -- `` Where ? '' 
`` To England . 
Shall you go ? '' 
`` Why do you say you to me ? '' 
`` I ask you whether you will go ? '' 
`` What do you expect me to do ? '' 
she said , clasping her hands . 
`` So , you will go ? '' 
`` If my father goes . '' 
`` So , you will go ? '' 
Cosette took Marius ' hand , and pressed it without replying . 
`` Very well , '' said Marius , `` then I will go elsewhere . '' 
Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words . 
She turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom . 
She stammered : -- `` What do you mean ? '' 
Marius looked at her , then raised his eyes to heaven , and answered : `` Nothing . '' 
When his eyes fell again , he saw Cosette smiling at him . 
The smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance , even at night . 
`` How silly we are ! 
Marius , I have an idea . '' 
`` What is it ? ''
