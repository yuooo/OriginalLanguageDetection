replied the young man firmly , `` I will drive Madame de Chevreuse out of my kingdom - and with her all who meddle with its secrets and mysteries . '' 
He had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech , or perhaps he wished to judge the effect of it , like those who , suffering from a chronic pain , and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering , touch their wound to procure a sharper pang . 
Anne of Austria was nearly fainting ; her eyes , open but meaningless , ceased to see for several seconds ; she stretched out her arms towards her other son , who supported and embraced her without fear of irritating the king . 
`` Sire , '' murmured she , `` you are treating your mother very cruelly . '' 
`` In what respect , madame ? '' 
replied he . 
`` I am only speaking of Madame de Chevreuse ; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security of the state and of my person ? 
Well , then , madame , I tell you Madame de Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money , and that she addressed herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret . '' 
`` A certain secret ! '' 
cried Anne of Austria . 
`` Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had committed , which is false , '' added Philippe . 
`` M. Fouquet rejected her offers with indignation , preferring the esteem of the king to complicity with such intriguers . 
Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M. Colbert , and as she is insatiable , and was not satisfied with having extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state , she has taken a still bolder flight , in search of surer sources of supply . 
Is that true , madame ? '' 
`` You know all , sire , '' said the queen , more uneasy than irritated . 
`` Now , '' continued Philippe , `` I have good reason to dislike this fury , who comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others . 
If Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed , and has concealed them in the shadow of its clemency , I will not permit Madame de Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate . '' 
The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother , that her son had pity on her . 
He took her hand and kissed it tenderly ; she did not feel that in that kiss , given in spite of repulsion and bitterness of the heart , there was a pardon for eight years of suffering . 
Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed themselves . 
Then , with a cheerful smile : `` We will not go to-day , '' said he , `` I have a plan . '' 
And , turning towards the door , he hoped to see Aramis , whose absence began to alarm him . 
The queen-mother wished to leave the room . 
`` Remain where you are , mother , '' said he , `` I wish you to make your peace with M. Fouquet . '' 
`` I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will ; I only dreaded his prodigalities . '' 
`` We will put that to rights , and will take nothing of the superintendent but his good qualities . '' 
`` What is your majesty looking for ? '' 
said Henrietta , seeing the king 's eyes constantly turned towards the door , and wishing to let fly a little poisoned arrow at his heart , supposing he was so anxiously expecting either La Valliere or a letter from her . 
`` My sister , '' said the young man , who had divined her thought , thanks to that marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to allow him the exercise , `` my sister , I am expecting a most distinguished man , a most able counselor , whom I wish to present to you all , recommending him to your good graces . 
Ah ! 
come in , then , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` What does your majesty wish ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , appearing . 
`` Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes , your friend ? '' 
`` Why , sire - '' `` I am waiting for him , and he does not come . 
Let him be sought for . '' 
D'Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied ; but soon , reflecting that Aramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king , he concluded that the king wished to preserve the secret . 
`` Sire , '' replied he , `` does your majesty absolutely require M. d'Herblay to be brought to you ? '' 
`` Absolutely is not the word , '' said Philippe ; `` I do not want him so particularly as that ; but if he can be found - '' `` I thought so , '' said D'Artagnan to himself . 
`` Is this M. d'Herblay the bishop of Vannes ? '' 
`` Yes , madame . '' 
`` A friend of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , madame ; an old musketeer . '' 
Anne of Austria blushed . 
`` One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies . '' 
The old queen repented of having wished to bite ; she broke off the conversation , in order to preserve the rest of her teeth . 
`` Whatever may be your choice , sire , '' said she , `` I have no doubt it will be excellent . '' 
All bowed in support of that sentiment . 
`` You will find in him , '' continued Philippe , `` the depth and penetration of M. de Richelieu , without the avarice of M. de Mazarin ! '' 
`` A prime minister , sire ? ''
