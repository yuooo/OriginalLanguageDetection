The girl stared boldly at her father , and showing the shoes which she had on her feet : -- `` A clever girl , possibly ; but I tell you I wo n't put these shoes on again , and that I wo n't , for the sake of my health , in the first place , and for the sake of cleanliness , in the next . 
I do n't know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch , and go ghi , ghi , ghi , the whole time . 
I prefer to go barefoot . '' 
`` You are right , '' said her father , in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl 's rudeness , `` but then , you will not be allowed to enter churches , for poor people must have shoes to do that . 
One can not go barefoot to the good God , '' he added bitterly . 
Then , returning to the subject which absorbed him : -- `` So you are sure that he will come ? '' 
`` He is following on my heels , '' said she . 
The man started up . 
A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance . 
`` Wife ! '' 
he exclaimed , `` you hear . 
Here is the philanthropist . 
Extinguish the fire . '' 
The stupefied mother did not stir . 
The father , with the agility of an acrobat , seized a broken-nosed jug which stood on the chimney , and flung the water on the brands . 
Then , addressing his eldest daughter : -- `` Here you ! 
Pull the straw off that chair ! '' 
His daughter did not understand . 
He seized the chair , and with one kick he rendered it seatless . 
His leg passed through it . 
As he withdrew his leg , he asked his daughter : -- `` Is it cold ? '' 
`` Very cold . 
It is snowing . '' 
The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window , and shouted to her in a thundering voice : -- `` Quick ! 
get off that bed , you lazy thing ! 
will you never do anything ? 
Break a pane of glass ! '' 
The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver . 
`` Break a pane ! '' 
he repeated . 
The child stood still in bewilderment . 
`` Do you hear me ? '' 
repeated her father , `` I tell you to break a pane ! '' 
The child , with a sort of terrified obedience , rose on tiptoe , and struck a pane with her fist . 
The glass broke and fell with a loud clatter . 
`` Good , '' said the father . 
He was grave and abrupt . 
His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret . 
One would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning . 
The mother , who had not said a word so far , now rose and demanded in a dull , slow , languid voice , whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state : -- `` What do you mean to do , my dear ? '' 
`` Get into bed , '' replied the man . 
His intonation admitted of no deliberation . 
The mother obeyed , and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets . 
In the meantime , a sob became audible in one corner . 
`` What 's that ? '' 
cried the father . 
The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist , without quitting the corner in which she was cowering . 
She had wounded herself while breaking the window ; she went off , near her mother 's pallet and wept silently . 
It was now the mother 's turn to start up and exclaim : -- `` Just see there ! 
What follies you commit !
