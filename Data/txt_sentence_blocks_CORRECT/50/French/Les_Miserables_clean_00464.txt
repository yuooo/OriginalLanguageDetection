He dared not call to them ; a cry might be heard and ruin everything . 
An idea occurred to him , a last idea , a flash of inspiration ; he drew from his pocket the end of Brujon 's rope , which he had detached from the chimney of the New Building , and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence . 
This rope fell at their feet . 
`` A widow , '' -LSB- 37 -RSB- said Babet . 
-LSB- 37 -RSB- Argot of the Temple . 
`` My tortouse ! '' 
-LSB- 38 -RSB- said Brujon . 
-LSB- 38 -RSB- Argot of the barriers . 
`` The tavern-keeper is there , '' said Montparnasse . 
They raised their eyes . 
Thenardier thrust out his head a very little . 
`` Quick ! '' 
said Montparnasse , `` have you the other end of the rope , Brujon ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Knot the two pieces together , we 'll fling him the rope , he can fasten it to the wall , and he 'll have enough of it to get down with . '' 
Thenardier ran the risk , and spoke : -- `` I am paralyzed with cold . '' 
`` We 'll warm you up . '' 
`` I ca n't budge . '' 
`` Let yourself slide , we 'll catch you . '' 
`` My hands are benumbed . '' 
`` Only fasten the rope to the wall . '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
`` Then one of us must climb up , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` Three stories ! '' 
ejaculated Brujon . 
An ancient plaster flue , which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times , ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see Thenardier . 
This flue , then much damaged and full of cracks , has since fallen , but the marks of it are still visible . 
It was very narrow . 
`` One might get up by the help of that , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` By that flue ? '' 
exclaimed Babet , `` a grown-up cove , never ! 
it would take a brat . '' 
`` A brat must be got , '' resumed Brujon . 
`` Where are we to find a young ` un ? '' 
said Guelemer . 
`` Wait , '' said Montparnasse . 
`` I 've got the very article . '' 
He opened the gate of the fence very softly , made sure that no one was passing along the street , stepped out cautiously , shut the gate behind him , and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille . 
Seven or eight minutes elapsed , eight thousand centuries to Thenardier ; Babet , Brujon , and Guelemer did not open their lips ; at last the gate opened once more , and Montparnasse appeared , breathless , and followed by Gavroche . 
The rain still rendered the street completely deserted . 
Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air . 
The water was dripping from his hair . 
Guelemer addressed him : -- `` Are you a man , young ` un ? '' 
Gavroche shrugged his shoulders , and replied : -- `` A young ` un like me 's a man , and men like you are babes . '' 
`` The brat 's tongue 's well hung ! '' 
exclaimed Babet . 
`` The Paris brat ai n't made of straw , '' added Brujon . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
asked Gavroche . 
Montparnasse answered : -- `` Climb up that flue . ''
