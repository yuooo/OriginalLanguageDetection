cried the unhappy governor , in a paroxysm of terror , and completely dumbfounded . 
`` For a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis - `` for so devoted a servant , I have no secrets ; '' and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux 's ear , as he said , in a low tone of voice , `` you know the resemblance between that unfortunate fellow , and - '' `` And the king ? 
- yes ! '' 
`` Very good ; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to persist - Can you guess what ? '' 
`` How is it likely I should guess ? '' 
`` To persist in saying that he was king of France ; to dress himself up in clothes like those of the king ; and then pretend to assume that he was the king himself . '' 
`` Gracious heavens ! '' 
`` That is the reason why I have brought him back again , my dear friend . 
He is mad and lets every one see how mad he is . '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` That is very simple ; let no one hold any communication with him . 
You understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king 's ears , the king , who had pitied his terrible affliction , and saw that all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude , became perfectly furious ; so that , now - and remember this very distinctly , dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , for it concerns you most closely - so that there is now , I repeat , sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself . 
You understand , Baisemeaux , sentence of death ! '' 
`` You need not ask me whether I understand . '' 
`` And now , let us go down , and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon again , unless you prefer he should come up here . '' 
`` What would be the good of that ? '' 
`` It would be better , perhaps , to enter his name in the prison-book at once ! '' 
`` Of course , certainly ; not a doubt of it . '' 
`` In that case , have him up . '' 
Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung , as a warning to every one to retire , in order to avoid meeting a prisoner , about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery . 
Then , when the passages were free , he went to take the prisoner from the carriage , at whose breast Porthos , faithful to the directions which had been given him , still kept his musket leveled . 
`` Ah ! 
is that you , miserable wretch ? '' 
cried the governor , as soon as he perceived the king . 
`` Very good , very good . '' 
And immediately , making the king get out of the carriage , he led him , still accompanied by Porthos , who had not taken off his mask , and Aramis , who again resumed his , up the stairs , to the second Bertaudiere , and opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had bemoaned his existence . 
The king entered the cell without pronouncing a single word : he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily . 
Baisemeaux shut the door upon him , turned the key twice in the lock , and then returned to Aramis . 
`` It is quite true , '' he said , in a low tone , `` that he bears a striking resemblance to the king ; but less so than you said . '' 
`` So that , '' said Aramis , `` you would not have been deceived by the substitution of the one for the other ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` You are a most valuable fellow , Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and now , set Seldon free . '' 
`` Oh , yes . 
I was going to forget that . 
I will go and give orders at once . '' 
`` Bah ! 
to-morrow will be time enough . '' 
`` To-morrow ! 
- oh , no . 
This very minute . '' 
`` Well ; go off to your affairs , I will go away to mine . 
But it is quite understood , is it not ? '' 
`` What ` is quite understood ' ? '' 
`` That no one is to enter the prisoner 's cell , expect with an order from the king ; an order which I will myself bring . '' 
`` Quite so . 
Adieu , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis returned to his companion . 
`` Now , Porthos , my good fellow , back again to Vaux , and as fast as possible . '' 
`` A man is light and easy enough , when he has faithfully served his king ; and , in serving him , saved his country , '' said Porthos . 
`` The horses will be as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven .
