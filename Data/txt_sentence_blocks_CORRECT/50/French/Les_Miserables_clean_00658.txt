Jean Valjean continued : `` It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage . 
I absented myself as much as was in my power . 
So I invented this injury in order that I might not commit a forgery , that I might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents , in order that I might escape from signing . '' 
Marius stammered . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
`` The meaning of it is , '' replied Jean Valjean , `` that I have been in the galleys . '' 
`` You are driving me mad ! '' 
exclaimed Marius in terror . 
`` Monsieur Pontmercy , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I was nineteen years in the galleys . 
For theft . 
Then , I was condemned for life for theft , for a second offence . 
At the present moment , I have broken my ban . '' 
In vain did Marius recoil before the reality , refuse the fact , resist the evidence , he was forced to give way . 
He began to understand , and , as always happens in such cases , he understood too much . 
An inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him ; an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind . 
He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future . 
`` Say all , say all ! '' 
he cried . 
`` You are Cosette 's father ! '' 
And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror . 
Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling . 
`` It is necessary that you should believe me here , sir ; although our oath to others may not be received in law ... '' Here he paused , then , with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority , he added , articulating slowly , and emphasizing the syllables : '' ... You will believe me . 
I the father of Cosette ! 
before God , no . 
Monsieur le Baron Pontmercy , I am a peasant of Faverolles . 
I earned my living by pruning trees . 
My name is not Fauchelevent , but Jean Valjean . 
I am not related to Cosette . 
Reassure yourself . '' 
Marius stammered : `` Who will prove that to me ? '' 
`` I . 
Since I tell you so . '' 
Marius looked at the man . 
He was melancholy yet tranquil . 
No lie could proceed from such a calm . 
That which is icy is sincere . 
The truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb . 
`` I believe you , '' said Marius . 
Jean Valjean bent his head , as though taking note of this , and continued : `` What am I to Cosette ? 
A passer-by . 
Ten years ago , I did not know that she was in existence . 
I love her , it is true . 
One loves a child whom one has seen when very young , being old oneself . 
When one is old , one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children . 
You may , it seems to me , suppose that I have something which resembles a heart . 
She was an orphan . 
Without either father or mother . 
She needed me . 
That is why I began to love her . 
Children are so weak that the first comer , even a man like me , can become their protector .
