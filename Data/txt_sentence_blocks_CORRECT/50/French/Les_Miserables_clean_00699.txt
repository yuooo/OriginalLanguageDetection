I will explain to you , my children , and for that reason , also , I am glad to see you . 
Black jet comes from England , white jet comes from Norway . 
All this is in this paper , which you will read . 
For bracelets , I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron , slides of iron laid together . 
It is prettier , better and less costly . 
You will understand how much money can be made in that way . 
So Cosette 's fortune is really hers . 
I give you these details , in order that your mind may be set at rest . '' 
The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door . 
The doctor dismissed her . 
But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared : `` Would you like a priest ? '' 
`` I have had one , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one . 
It is probable , in fact , that the Bishop was present at this death agony . 
Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins . 
Jean Valjean resumed : `` Have no fear , Monsieur Pontmercy , I adjure you . 
The six hundred thousand francs really belong to Cosette . 
My life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them ! 
We managed to do very well with those glass goods . 
We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery . 
However , we could not equal the black glass of England . 
A gross , which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains , only costs three francs . '' 
When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death , we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back . 
Cosette gave her hand to Marius , and both , mute with anguish , not knowing what to say to the dying man , stood trembling and despairing before him . 
Jean Valjean sank moment by moment . 
He was failing ; he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon . 
His breath had become intermittent ; a little rattling interrupted it . 
He found some difficulty in moving his forearm , his feet had lost all movement , and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased , all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow . 
The light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes . 
His face paled and smiled . 
Life was no longer there , it was something else . 
His breath sank , his glance grew grander . 
He was a corpse on which the wings could be felt . 
He made a sign to Cosette to draw near , then to Marius ; the last minute of the last hour had , evidently , arrived . 
He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance , and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him . 
`` Draw near , draw near , both of you . 
I love you dearly . 
Oh ! 
how good it is to die like this ! 
And thou lovest me also , my Cosette . 
I knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man . 
How kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins ! 
Thou wilt weep for me a little , wilt thou not ? 
Not too much . 
I do not wish thee to have any real griefs . 
You must enjoy yourselves a great deal , my children . 
I forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest . 
A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty . 
It really was a good business . 
So there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs , Monsieur Pontmercy .
