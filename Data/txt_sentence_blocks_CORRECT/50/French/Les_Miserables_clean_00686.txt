He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger . 
An examining judge could not have done the look better . 
He almost lay in wait for him . 
He confined himself to replying : `` State the case precisely . '' 
The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs , drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column , but scrutinizing Marius in his turn , with the green gaze of his spectacles . 
`` So be it , Monsieur le Baron . 
I will be precise . 
I have a secret to sell to you . '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` A secret . '' 
`` Which concerns me ? '' 
`` Somewhat . '' 
`` What is the secret ? '' 
Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him . 
`` I commence gratis , '' said the stranger . 
`` You will see that I am interesting . '' 
`` Speak . '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron , you have in your house a thief and an assassin . '' 
Marius shuddered . 
`` In my house ? 
no , '' said he . 
The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on : `` An assassin and a thief . 
Remark , Monsieur le Baron , that I do not here speak of ancient deeds , deeds of the past which have lapsed , which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God . 
I speak of recent deeds , of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour . 
I continue . 
This man has insinuated himself into your confidence , and almost into your family under a false name . 
I am about to tell you his real name . 
And to tell it to you for nothing . '' 
`` I am listening . '' 
`` His name is Jean Valjean . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` I am going to tell you , equally for nothing , who he is . '' 
`` Say on . '' 
`` He is an ex-convict . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` You know it since I have had the honor of telling you . '' 
`` No . 
I knew it before . '' 
Marius ' cold tone , that double reply of `` I know it , '' his laconicism , which was not favorable to dialogue , stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger . 
He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius , which was instantly extinguished . 
Rapid as it was , this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it ; it did not escape Marius . 
Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls ; the eye , that vent-hole of the thought , glows with it ; spectacles hide nothing ; try putting a pane of glass over hell ! 
The stranger resumed with a smile : `` I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron . 
In any case , you ought to perceive that I am well informed . 
Now what I have to tell you is known to myself alone . 
This concerns the fortune of Madame la Baronne . 
It is an extraordinary secret . 
It is for sale -- I make you the first offer of it . 
Cheap . 
Twenty thousand francs . ''
