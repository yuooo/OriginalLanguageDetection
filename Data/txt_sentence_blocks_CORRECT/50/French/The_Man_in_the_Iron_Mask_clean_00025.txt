`` Yes , I ask you , what has he done for you ? '' 
`` My friend , he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished : he has taken my measure without touching me ! '' 
`` Ah , bah ! 
tell me how he did it . '' 
`` First , then , they went , I do n't know where , for a number of lay figures , of all heights and sizes , hoping there would be one to suit mine , but the largest - that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard - was two inches too short , and a half foot too narrow in the chest . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` It is exactly as I tell you , D'Artagnan ; but he is a great man , or at the very least a great tailor , is this M. Moliere . 
He was not at all put at fault by the circumstance . '' 
`` What did he do , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is a very simple matter . 
I ` faith , 't is an unheard-of thing that people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method from the first . 
What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared me ! '' 
`` Not to mention of the costumes , my dear Porthos . '' 
`` Yes , thirty dresses . '' 
`` Well , my dear Porthos , come , tell me M. Moliere 's plan . '' 
`` Moliere ? 
You call him so , do you ? 
I shall make a point of recollecting his name . '' 
`` Yes ; or Poquelin , if you prefer that . '' 
`` No ; I like Moliere best . 
When I wish to recollect his name , I shall think of voliere -LSB- an aviary -RSB- ; and as I have one at Pierrefonds - '' `` Capital ! '' 
returned D'Artagnan . 
`` And M. Moliere 's plan ? '' '' 
'T is this : instead of pulling me to pieces , as all these rascals do - of making me bend my back , and double my joints - all of them low and dishonorable practices - '' D'Artagnan made a sign of approbation with his head . '' 
` Monsieur , ' he said to me , '' continued Porthos , '' ' a gentleman ought to measure himself . 
Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass ; ' and I drew near the glass . 
I must own I did not exactly understand what this good M. Voliere wanted with me . '' 
`` Moliere ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , Moliere - Moliere . 
And as the fear of being measured still possessed me , ` Take care , ' said I to him , ` what you are going to do with me ; I am very ticklish , I warn you . ' 
But he , with his soft voice -LRB- for he is a courteous fellow , we must admit , my friend -RRB- , he with his soft voice , ` Monsieur , ' said he , ` that your dress may fit you well , it must be made according to your figure . 
Your figure is exactly reflected in this mirror . 
We shall take the measure of this reflection . ' '' 
`` In fact , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you saw yourself in the glass ; but where did they find one in which you could see your whole figure ? '' 
`` My good friend , it is the very glass in which the king is used to look to see himself . '' 
`` Yes ; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are . '' 
`` Ah ! 
well , I know not how that may be ; it is , no doubt , a cunning way of flattering the king ; but the looking-glass was too large for me . 
'T is true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of glass , placed one above another , and its breadth of three similar parallelograms in juxtaposition . '' 
`` Oh , Porthos ! 
what excellent words you have command of . 
Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary ? '' 
`` At Belle-Isle . 
Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic studies and castramentative experiments . '' 
D'Artagnan recoiled , as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked the breath out of his body . 
`` Ah ! 
very good . 
Let us return to the looking-glass , my friend . ''
