`` Well ! 
but do you suppose the king would haggle with you ? '' 
said Colbert . 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur , you have not understood me , '' replied D'Artagnan , sure of carrying his point . 
`` I was telling you that I , an old captain , formerly chief of the king 's guard , having precedence of the marechaux of France - I saw myself one day in the trenches with two other equals , the captain of the guards and the colonel commanding the Swiss . 
Now , at no price will I suffer that . 
I have old habits , and I will stand or fall by them . '' 
Colbert felt this blow , but he was prepared for it . 
`` I have been thinking of what you said just now , '' replied he . 
`` About what , monsieur ? '' 
`` We were speaking of canals and marshes in which people are drowned . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
`` Well ! 
if they are drowned , it is for want of a boat , a plank , or a stick . '' 
`` Of a stick , however short it may be , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Exactly , '' said Colbert . 
`` And , therefore , I never heard of an instance of a marechal of France being drowned . '' 
D'Artagnan became very pale with joy , and in a not very firm voice , `` People would be very proud of me in my country , '' said he , `` if I were a marechal of France ; but a man must have commanded an expedition in chief to obtain the baton . '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert , `` here is in this pocket-book which you will study , a plan of campaign you will have to lead a body of troops to carry out in the next spring . '' 
-LRB- 12 -RRB- D'Artagnan took the book , tremblingly , and his fingers meeting those of Colbert , the minister pressed the hand of the musketeer loyally . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we had both a revenge to take , one over the other . 
I have begun ; it is now your turn ! '' 
`` I will do you justice , monsieur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` and implore you to tell the king that the first opportunity that shall offer , he may depend upon a victory , or to behold me dead - or both . '' 
`` Then I will have the fleurs-de-lis for your marechal 's baton prepared immediately , '' said Colbert . 
On the morrow , Aramis , who was setting out for Madrid , to negotiate the neutrality of Spain , came to embrace D'Artagnan at his hotel . 
`` Let us love each other for four , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` We are now but two . '' 
`` And you will , perhaps , never see me again , dear D'Artagnan , '' said Aramis ; `` if you knew how I have loved you ! 
I am old , I am extinct - ah , I am almost dead . '' 
`` My friend , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you will live longer than I shall : diplomacy commands you to live ; but , for my part , honor condemns me to die . '' 
`` Bah ! 
such men as we are , monsieur le marechal , '' said Aramis , `` only die satisfied with joy in glory . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
replied D'Artagnan , with a melancholy smile , `` I assure you , monsieur le duc , I feel very little appetite for either . '' 
They once more embraced , and , two hours after , separated - forever . 
The Death of D'Artagnan . 
Contrary to that which generally happens , whether in politics or morals , each kept his promises , and did honor to his engagements . 
The king recalled M. de Guiche , and banished M. le Chevalier de Lorraine ; so that Monsieur became ill in consequence . 
Madame set out for London , where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother , Charles II. , acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle de Keroualle , that the alliance between England and France was signed , and the English vessels , ballasted by a few millions of French gold , made a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces . 
Charles II . 
had promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude for her good counsels ; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth . 
Colbert had promised the king vessels , munitions , victories . 
He kept his word , as is well known . 
At length Aramis , upon whose promises there was least dependence to be placed , wrote Colbert the following letter , on the subject of the negotiations which he had undertaken at Madrid : `` MONSIEUR COLBERT , - I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P. Oliva , general ad interim of the Society of Jesus , my provisional successor . 
The reverend father will explain to you , Monsieur Colbert , that I preserve to myself the direction of all the affairs of the order which concern France and Spain ; but that I am not willing to retain the title of general , which would throw too high a side-light on the progress of the negotiations with which His Catholic Majesty wishes to intrust me . 
I shall resume that title by the command of his majesty , when the labors I have undertaken in concert with you , for the great glory of God and His Church , shall be brought to a good end . 
The R. P. Oliva will inform you likewise , monsieur , of the consent His Catholic Majesty gives to the signature of a treaty which assures the neutrality of Spain in the event of a war between France and the United Provinces . 
This consent will be valid even if England , instead of being active , should satisfy herself with remaining neutral .
