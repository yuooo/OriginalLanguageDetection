She turned to him with a stupefied air . 
`` Eponine ! 
How do you know that my name is Eponine ? '' 
`` Promise what I tell you ! '' 
But she did not seem to hear him . 
`` That 's nice ! 
You have called me Eponine ! '' 
Marius grasped both her arms at once . 
`` But answer me , in the name of Heaven ! 
pay attention to what I am saying to you , swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know ! '' 
`` My father ! '' 
said she . 
`` Ah yes , my father ! 
Be at ease . 
He 's in close confinement . 
Besides , what do I care for my father ! '' 
`` But you do not promise me ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
`` Let go of me ! '' 
she said , bursting into a laugh , `` how you do shake me ! 
Yes ! 
Yes ! 
I promise that ! 
I swear that to you ! 
What is that to me ? 
I will not tell my father the address . 
There ! 
Is that right ? 
Is that it ? '' 
`` Nor to any one ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` Nor to any one . '' 
`` Now , '' resumed Marius , `` take me there . '' 
`` Immediately ? '' 
`` Immediately . '' 
`` Come along . 
Ah ! 
how pleased he is ! '' 
said she . 
After a few steps she halted . 
`` You are following me too closely , Monsieur Marius . 
Let me go on ahead , and follow me so , without seeming to do it . 
A nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me . '' 
No tongue can express all that lay in that word , woman , thus pronounced by that child . 
She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more ; Marius joined her . 
She addressed him sideways , and without turning towards him : -- `` By the way , you know that you promised me something ? '' 
Marius fumbled in his pocket . 
All that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for Thenardier the father . 
He took them and laid them in Eponine 's hand . 
She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground , and gazed at him with a gloomy air .
