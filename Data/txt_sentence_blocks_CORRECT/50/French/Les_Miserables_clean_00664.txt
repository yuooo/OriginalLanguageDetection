you shall see , gentlemen , that I , in my turn , can say : It is impossible . 
Then who will be caught ? 
I beseech you , my little Marius , let me stay here with you two . '' 
`` I swear to you , that it is indispensable that we should be alone . '' 
`` Well , am I anybody ? '' 
Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word . 
Cosette turned to him : `` In the first place , father , I want you to come and embrace me . 
What do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part ? 
who gave me such a father as that ? 
You must perceive that my family life is very unhappy . 
My husband beats me . 
Come , embrace me instantly . '' 
Jean Valjean approached . 
Cosette turned toward Marius . 
`` As for you , I shall make a face at you . '' 
Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean advanced a step toward her . 
Cosette recoiled . 
`` Father , you are pale . 
Does your arm hurt you ? '' 
`` It is well , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Did you sleep badly ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Are you sad ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Embrace me if you are well , if you sleep well , if you are content , I will not scold you . '' 
And again she offered him her brow . 
Jean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial gleam . 
`` Smile . '' 
Jean Valjean obeyed . 
It was the smile of a spectre . 
`` Now , defend me against my husband . '' 
`` Cosette ! 
... '' ejaculated Marius . 
`` Get angry , father . 
Say that I must stay . 
You can certainly talk before me . 
So you think me very silly . 
What you say is astonishing ! 
business , placing money in a bank a great matter truly . 
Men make mysteries out of nothing . 
I am very pretty this morning . 
Look at me , Marius . '' 
And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders , and an indescribably exquisite pout , she glanced at Marius . 
`` I love you ! '' 
said Marius . 
`` I adore you ! '' 
said Cosette . 
And they fell irresistibly into each other 's arms . 
`` Now , '' said Cosette , adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown , with a triumphant little grimace , `` I shall stay . ''
