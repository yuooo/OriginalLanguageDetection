The man resumed his writing . 
STRATEGY AND TACTICS Marius , with a load upon his breast , was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised , when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post . 
The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly . 
The eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold . 
On her feet , she had large , coarse , men 's shoes , bespattered with mud , which had splashed even to her red ankles , and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters . 
Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously , but she had probably deposited it at his door , in order that she might inspire the more pity , and had picked it up again on emerging . 
She entered , pushed the door to behind her , paused to take breath , for she was completely breathless , then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy : -- `` He is coming ! '' 
The father turned his eyes towards her , the woman turned her head , the little sister did not stir . 
`` Who ? '' 
demanded her father . 
`` The gentleman ! '' 
`` The philanthropist ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` From the church of Saint-Jacques ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That old fellow ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And he is coming ? '' 
`` He is following me . '' 
`` You are sure ? '' 
`` I am sure . '' 
`` There , truly , he is coming ? '' 
`` He is coming in a fiacre . '' 
`` In a fiacre . 
He is Rothschild . '' 
The father rose . 
`` How are you sure ? 
If he is coming in a fiacre , how is it that you arrive before him ? 
You gave him our address at least ? 
Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor , on the right ? 
If he only does not make a mistake ! 
So you found him at the church ? 
Did he read my letter ? 
What did he say to you ? '' 
`` Ta , ta , ta , '' said the girl , `` how you do gallop on , my good man ! 
See here : I entered the church , he was in his usual place , I made him a reverence , and I handed him the letter ; he read it and said to me : ` Where do you live , my child ? ' 
I said : ` Monsieur , I will show you . ' 
He said to me : ` No , give me your address , my daughter has some purchases to make , I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do . ' 
I gave him the address . 
When I mentioned the house , he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant , then he said : ` Never mind , I will come . ' 
When the mass was finished , I watched him leave the church with his daughter , and I saw them enter a carriage . 
I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor , on the right . '' 
`` And what makes you think that he will come ? '' 
`` I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier . 
That is what made me run so . '' 
`` How do you know that it was the same fiacre ? '' 
`` Because I took notice of the number , so there ! '' 
`` What was the number ? '' 
`` 440 . '' 
`` Good , you are a clever girl . ''
