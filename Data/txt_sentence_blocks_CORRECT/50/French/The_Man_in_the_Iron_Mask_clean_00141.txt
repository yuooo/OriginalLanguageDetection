`` Since you explain yourself with such frankness , it is our duty to be frank , likewise . 
Yes , you are ruined -- yes , you are hastening to your ruin - stop . 
And , in the first place , what money have we left ? '' 
`` Seven hundred thousand livres , '' said the intendant . 
`` Bread , '' murmured Madame Fouquet . 
`` Relays , '' said Pelisson , `` relays , and fly ! '' 
`` Whither ? '' 
`` To Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly ! '' 
`` If monseigneur flies , '' said Madame Belliere , `` it will be said that he was guilty - was afraid . '' 
`` More than that , it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with me . '' 
`` We will draw up memoirs to justify you , '' said La Fontaine . 
`` Fly ! '' 
`` I will remain , '' said Fouquet . 
`` And , besides , does not everything serve me ? '' 
`` You have Belle-Isle , '' cried the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` And I am naturally going there , when going to Nantes , '' replied the superintendent . 
`` Patience , then , patience ! '' 
`` Before arriving at Nantes , what a distance ! '' 
said Madame Fouquet . 
`` Yes , I know that well , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` But what is to be done there ? 
The king summons me to the States . 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me ; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness . '' 
`` Well , I have discovered the means of reconciling everything , '' cried Pelisson . 
`` You are going to set out for Nantes . '' 
Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise . 
`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened . 
In fact , you will carry your money against all chances ; and , whilst flying , you will only have obeyed the king ; then , reaching the sea , when you like , you will embark for Belle-Isle , and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please you , like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its eyrie . '' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband . 
`` Do so , '' said Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do it ! 
do it ! '' 
cried all his friends . 
`` I will do so , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` This very evening ? '' 
`` In an hour ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune , '' said the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` And , if necessary , we will go and discover a new world , '' added La Fontaine , intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm . 
A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope . 
`` A courier from the king , '' said the master of the ceremonies . 
A profound silence immediately ensued , as if the message brought by this courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment before . 
Every one waited to see what the master would do . 
His brow was streaming with perspiration , and he was really suffering from his fever at that instant . 
He passed into his cabinet , to receive the king 's message . 
There prevailed , as we have said , such a silence in the chambers , and throughout the attendance , that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet , saying , `` That is well , monsieur . '' 
This voice was , however , broken by fatigue , and trembled with emotion . 
An instant after , Fouquet called Gourville , who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation .
