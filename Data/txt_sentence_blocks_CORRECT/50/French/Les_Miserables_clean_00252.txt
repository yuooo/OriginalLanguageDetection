`` Father Fauvent , what the dead wish must be done . '' 
The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet . 
Fauchelevent held his peace . 
She went on : -- `` I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord , who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life , and who bear wonderful fruit . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden . '' 
`` Besides , she is more than a dead woman , she is a saint . '' 
`` Like yourself , reverend Mother . '' 
`` She slept in her coffin for twenty years , by express permission of our Holy Father , Pius VII . 
-- '' `` The one who crowned the Emp -- Buonaparte . '' 
For a clever man like Fauchelevent , this allusion was an awkward one . 
Fortunately , the prioress , completely absorbed in her own thoughts , did not hear it . 
She continued : -- `` Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` Saint Didorus , Archbishop of Cappadocia , desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb : Acarus , which signifies , a worm of the earth ; this was done . 
Is this true ? '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The blessed Mezzocane , Abbot of Aquila , wished to be buried beneath the gallows ; this was done . '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` Saint Terentius , Bishop of Port , where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea , requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides , in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb . 
This was done . 
The dead must be obeyed . '' 
`` So be it . '' 
`` The body of Bernard Guidonis , born in France near Roche-Abeille , was , as he had ordered , and in spite of the king of Castile , borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges , although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy in Spain . 
Can the contrary be affirmed ? '' 
`` For that matter , no , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse . '' 
Several beads of the chaplet were told off , still in silence . 
The prioress resumed : -- `` Father Fauvent , Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years . '' 
`` That is just . '' 
`` It is a continuation of her slumber . '' 
`` So I shall have to nail up that coffin ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And we are to reject the undertaker 's coffin ? '' 
`` Precisely . '' 
`` I am at the orders of the very reverend community . '' 
`` The four Mother Precentors will assist you . '' 
`` In nailing up the coffin ? 
I do not need them . '' 
`` No . 
In lowering the coffin . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` Into the vault . '' 
`` What vault ? '' 
`` Under the altar . '' 
Fauchelevent started . 
`` The vault under the altar ? '' 
`` Under the altar . '' 
`` But -- '' `` You will have an iron bar . '' 
`` Yes , but -- '' `` You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring . '' 
`` But -- '' `` The dead must be obeyed .
