`` This . 
A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me : ` Do you know Mother Hucheloup ? ' 
I said : ` Yes , Rue Chanvrerie , the old man 's widow ; ' he said to me : ` Go there . 
There you will find M. Bossuet . 
Tell him from me : `` A B C '' . ' 
It 's a joke that they 're playing on you , is n't it . 
He gave me ten sous . '' 
`` Joly , lend me ten sous , '' said Laigle ; and , turning to Grantaire : `` Grantaire , lend me ten sous . '' 
This made twenty sous , which Laigle handed to the lad . 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the urchin . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
inquired Laigle . 
`` Navet , Gavroche 's friend . '' 
`` Stay with us , '' said Laigle . 
`` Breakfast with us , '' said Grantaire , The child replied : -- `` I ca n't , I belong in the procession , I 'm the one to shout ` Down with Polignac ! ' '' 
And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him , which is the most respectful of all possible salutes , he took his departure . 
The child gone , Grantaire took the word : -- `` That is the pure-bred gamin . 
There are a great many varieties of the gamin species . 
The notary 's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter , the cook 's gamin is called a scullion , the baker 's gamin is called a mitron , the lackey 's gamin is called a groom , the marine gamin is called the cabin-boy , the soldier 's gamin is called the drummer-boy , the painter 's gamin is called paint-grinder , the tradesman 's gamin is called an errand-boy , the courtesan gamin is called the minion , the kingly gamin is called the dauphin , the god gamin is called the bambino . '' 
In the meantime , Laigle was engaged in reflection ; he said half aloud : -- `` A B C , that is to say : the burial of Lamarque . '' 
`` The tall blonde , '' remarked Grantaire , `` is Enjolras , who is sending you a warning . '' 
`` Shall we go ? '' 
ejaculated Bossuet . 
`` It 's raiding , '' said Joly . 
`` I have sworn to go through fire , but not through water . 
I do n't wand to ged a gold . '' 
`` I shall stay here , '' said Grantaire . 
`` I prefer a breakfast to a hearse . '' 
`` Conclusion : we remain , '' said Laigle . 
`` Well , then , let us drink . 
Besides , we might miss the funeral without missing the riot . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the riot , I am with you ! '' 
cried Joly . 
Laigle rubbed his hands . 
`` Now we 're going to touch up the revolution of 1830 . 
As a matter of fact , it does hurt the people along the seams . '' 
`` I do n't think much of your revolution , '' said Grantaire . 
`` I do n't execrate this Government . 
It is the crown tempered by the cotton night-cap . 
It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella . 
In fact , I think that to-day , with the present weather , Louis Philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions , he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people , and open the umbrella end against heaven . '' 
The room was dark , large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight . 
There was no one in the wine-shop , or in the street , every one having gone off `` to watch events . '' 
`` Is it mid-day or midnight ? '' 
cried Bossuet . 
`` You ca n't see your hand before your face . 
Gibelotte , fetch a light . '' 
Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way . 
`` Enjolras disdains me , '' he muttered .
