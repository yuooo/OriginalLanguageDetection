Woe be to you , Biscarrat ! '' 
`` You are the cause of my being wounded unto death , '' said one of the young men , letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm , and spattering it into Biscarrat 's livid face . 
`` My blood be on your head ! '' 
And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man . 
`` But , at least , tell us who is there ? '' 
cried several furious voices . 
Biscarrat remained silent . 
`` Tell us , or die ! '' 
cried the wounded man , raising himself upon one knee , and lifting towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword . 
Biscarrat rushed towards him , opening his breast for the blow , but the wounded man fell back not to rise again , uttering a groan which was his last . 
Biscarrat , with hair on end , haggard eyes , and bewildered head , advanced towards the interior of the cavern , saying , `` You are right . 
Death to me , who have allowed my comrades to be assassinated . 
I am a worthless wretch ! '' 
And throwing away his sword , for he wished to die without defending himself , he rushed head foremost into the cavern . 
The others followed him . 
The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his example ; but they did not go further than the first . 
A second discharge laid five upon the icy sand ; and as it was impossible to see whence this murderous thunder issued , the others fell back with a terror that can be better imagined than described . 
But , far from flying , as the others had done , Biscarrat remained safe and sound , seated on a fragment of rock , and waited . 
There were only six gentlemen left . 
`` Seriously , '' said one of the survivors , `` is it the devil ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
it is much worse , '' said another . 
`` Ask Biscarrat , he knows . '' 
`` Where is Biscarrat ? '' 
The young men looked round them , and saw that Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` He is dead ! '' 
said two or three voices . 
`` Oh ! 
no ! '' 
replied another , `` I saw him through the smoke , sitting quietly on a rock . 
He is in the cavern ; he is waiting for us . '' 
`` He must know who are there . '' 
`` And how should he know them ? '' 
`` He was taken prisoner by the rebels . '' 
`` That is true . 
Well ! 
let us call him , and learn from him whom we have to deal with . '' 
And all voices shouted , `` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
But Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` Good ! '' 
said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair . 
`` We have no longer any need of him ; here are reinforcements coming . '' 
In fact , a company of guards , left in the rear by their officers , whom the ardor of the chase had carried away - from seventy-five to eighty men - arrived in good order , led by their captain and the first lieutenant . 
The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers ; and , in language the eloquence of which may be easily imagined , they related the adventure , and asked for aid . 
The captain interrupted them . 
`` Where are your companions ? '' 
demanded he . 
`` Dead ! '' 
`` But there were sixteen of you ! ''
