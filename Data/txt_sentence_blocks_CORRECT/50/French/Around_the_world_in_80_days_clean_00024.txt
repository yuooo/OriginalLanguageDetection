`` She may , '' replied the policeman . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four-wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . 
No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . 
They first passed through the `` black town , '' with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the `` European town , '' which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth . 
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion . 
The policeman having requested his prisoners for so , truly , they might be called-to descend , conducted them into a room with barred windows , and said : `` You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight . '' 
He then retired , and closed the door . 
`` Why , we are prisoners ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , falling into a chair . 
Aouda , with an emotion she tried to conceal , said to Mr. Fogg : `` Sir , you must leave me to my fate ! 
It is on my account that you receive this treatment , it is for having saved me ! '' 
Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible . 
It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee . 
The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge . 
There was some mistake . 
Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon Aouda , but would escort her to Hong Kong . 
`` But the steamer leaves at noon ! '' 
observed Passepartout , nervously . 
`` We shall be on board by noon , '' replied his master , placidly . 
It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself , `` Parbleu that 's certain ! 
Before noon we shall be on board . '' 
But he was by no means reassured . 
At half-past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall . 
It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment . 
Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk . 
Immediately after , Judge Obadiah , a fat , round man , followed by the clerk , entered . 
He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail , and put it hurriedly on his head . 
`` The first case , '' said he . 
Then , putting his hand to his head , he exclaimed , `` Heh ! 
This is not my wig ! '' 
`` No , your worship , '' returned the clerk , `` it is mine . '' 
`` My dear Mr. Oysterpuff , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk 's wig ? '' 
The wigs were exchanged . 
Passepartout was getting nervous , for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity . 
`` The first case , '' repeated Judge Obadiah . 
`` Phileas Fogg ? '' 
demanded Oysterpuff . 
`` I am here , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` Passepartout ? '' 
`` Present , '' responded Passepartout . 
`` Good , '' said the judge . 
`` You have been looked for , prisoners , for two days on the trains from Bombay . '' 
`` But of what are we accused ? '' 
asked Passepartout , impatiently . 
`` You are about to be informed . '' 
`` I am an English subject , sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` and I have the right -- '' `` Have you been ill-treated ? '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Very well ; let the complainants come in . '' 
A door was swung open by order of the judge , and three Indian priests entered . 
`` That 's it , '' muttered Passepartout ; `` these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady . ''
