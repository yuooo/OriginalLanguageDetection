`` I fancy you already on your road , my dear little sister , consoled for all your griefs . '' 
`` I will go , on two conditions . 
The first is , that I shall know what I am negotiating about . '' 
`` That is it . 
The Dutch , you know , insult me daily in their gazettes , and by their republican attitude . 
I do not like republics . '' 
`` That may easily be imagined , sire . '' 
`` I see with pain that these kings of the sea - they call themselves so - keep trade from France in the Indies , and that their vessels will soon occupy all the ports of Europe . 
Such a power is too near me , sister . '' 
`` They are your allies , nevertheless . '' 
`` That is why they were wrong in having the medal you have heard of struck ; a medal which represents Holland stopping the sun , as Joshua did , with this legend : The sun had stopped before me . 
There is not much fraternity in that , is there ? '' 
`` I thought you had forgotten that miserable episode ? '' 
`` I never forget anything , sister . 
And if my true friends , such as your brother Charles , are willing to second me - '' The princess remained pensively silent . 
`` Listen to me ; there is the empire of the seas to be shared , '' said Louis XIV . 
`` For this partition , which England submits to , could I not represent the second party as well as the Dutch ? '' 
`` We have Mademoiselle de Keroualle to treat that question , '' replied Madame . 
`` Your second condition for going , if you please , sister ? '' 
`` The consent of Monsieur , my husband . '' 
`` You shall have it . '' 
`` Then consider me already gone , brother . '' 
On hearing these words , Louis XIV . 
turned round towards the corner of the room in which D'Artagnan , Colbert , and Aramis stood , and made an affirmative sign to his minister . 
Colbert then broke in on the conversation suddenly , and said to Aramis : `` Monsieur l'ambassadeur , shall we talk about business ? '' 
D'Artagnan immediately withdrew , from politeness . 
He directed his steps towards the fireplace , within hearing of what the king was about to say to Monsieur , who , evidently uneasy , had gone to him . 
The face of the king was animated . 
Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will , the expression of which already met no further contradiction in France , and was soon to meet no more in Europe . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the king to his brother , `` I am not pleased with M. le Chevalier de Lorraine . 
You , who do him the honor to protect him , must advise him to travel for a few months . '' 
These words fell with the crush of an avalanche upon Monsieur , who adored his favorite , and concentrated all his affections in him . 
`` In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your majesty ? '' 
cried he , darting a furious look at Madame . 
`` I will tell you that when he is gone , '' said the king , suavely . 
`` And also when Madame , here , shall have crossed over into England . '' 
`` Madame ! 
in England ! '' 
murmured Monsieur , in amazement . 
`` In a week , brother , '' continued the king , `` whilst we will go whither I will shortly tell you . '' 
And the king turned on his heel , smiling in his brother 's face , to sweeten , as it were , the bitter draught he had given him . 
During this time Colbert was talking with the Duc d'Almeda . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Colbert to Aramis , `` this is the moment for us to come to an understanding . 
I have made your peace with the king , and I owed that clearly to a man of so much merit ; but as you have often expressed friendship for me , an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof of it . 
You are , besides , more a Frenchman than a Spaniard . 
Shall we secure - answer me frankly - the neutrality of Spain , if we undertake anything against the United Provinces ? '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Aramis , `` the interest of Spain is clear . 
To embroil Europe with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy , but the king of France is an ally of the United Provinces . 
You are not ignorant , besides , that it would infer a maritime war , and that France is in no state to undertake this with advantage . '' 
Colbert , turning round at this moment , saw D'Artagnan who was seeking some interlocutor , during this `` aside '' of the king and Monsieur .
