`` Kiss the hand of a prisoner , '' he said , shaking his head , `` to what purpose ? '' 
`` Why did you tell me , '' said Aramis , `` that you were happy here ? 
Why , that you aspired to nothing ? 
Why , in a word , by thus speaking , do you prevent me from being frank in my turn ? '' 
The same light shone a third time in the young man 's eyes , but died ineffectually away as before . 
`` You distrust me , '' said Aramis . 
`` And why say you so , monsieur ? '' 
`` Oh , for a very simple reason ; if you know what you ought to know , you ought to mistrust everybody . '' 
`` Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful , since you suspect me of knowing what I do not know . '' 
Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance . 
`` Oh , monseigneur ! 
you drive me to despair , '' said he , striking the armchair with his fist . 
`` And , on my part , I do not comprehend you , monsieur . '' 
`` Well , then , try to understand me . '' 
The prisoner looked fixedly at Aramis . 
`` Sometimes it seems to me , '' said the latter , `` that I have before me the man whom I seek , and then - '' `` And then your man disappears , - is it not so ? '' 
said the prisoner , smiling . 
`` So much the better . '' 
Aramis rose . 
`` Certainly , '' said he ; `` I have nothing further to say to a man who mistrusts me as you do . '' 
`` And I , monsieur , '' said the prisoner , in the same tone , `` have nothing to say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be mistrustful of everybody . '' 
`` Even of his old friends , '' said Aramis . 
`` Oh , monseigneur , you are too prudent ! '' 
`` Of my old friends ? 
- you one of my old friends , - you ? '' 
`` Do you no longer remember , '' said Aramis , `` that you once saw , in the village where your early years were spent - '' `` Do you know the name of the village ? '' 
asked the prisoner . 
`` Noisy-le-Sec , monseigneur , '' answered Aramis , firmly . 
`` Go on , '' said the young man , with an immovable aspect . 
`` Stay , monseigneur , '' said Aramis ; `` if you are positively resolved to carry on this game , let us break off . 
I am here to tell you many things , 't is true ; but you must allow me to see that , on your side , you have a desire to know them . 
Before revealing the important matters I still withhold , be assured I am in need of some encouragement , if not candor ; a little sympathy , if not confidence . 
But you keep yourself intrenched in a pretended which paralyzes me . 
Oh , not for the reason you think ; for , ignorant as you may be , or indifferent as you feign to be , you are none the less what you are , monseigneur , and there is nothing - nothing , mark me ! 
which can cause you not to be so . '' 
`` I promise you , '' replied the prisoner , `` to hear you without impatience . 
Only it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have already asked , ` Who are you ? ' '' 
`` Do you remember , fifteen or eighteen years ago , seeing at Noisy-le-Sec a cavalier , accompanied by a lady in black silk , with flame-colored ribbons in her hair ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the young man ; `` I once asked the name of this cavalier , and they told me that he called himself the Abbe d'Herblay . 
I was astonished that the abbe had so warlike an air , and they replied that there was nothing singular in that , seeing that he was one of Louis XIII . 
's musketeers . '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that musketeer and abbe , afterwards bishop of Vannes , is your confessor now . '' 
`` I know it ; I recognized you . '' 
`` Then , monseigneur , if you know that , I must further add a fact of which you are ignorant - that if the king were to know this evening of the presence of this musketeer , this abbe , this bishop , this confessor , here - he , who has risked everything to visit you , to-morrow would behold the steely glitter of the executioner 's axe in a dungeon more gloomy , more obscure than yours . '' 
While listening to these words , delivered with emphasis , the young man had raised himself on his couch , and was now gazing more and more eagerly at Aramis . 
The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some confidence from it . 
`` Yes , '' he murmured , `` I remember perfectly . 
The woman of whom you speak came once with you , and twice afterwards with another . '' 
He hesitated . 
`` With another , who came to see you every month - is it not so , monseigneur ? ''
