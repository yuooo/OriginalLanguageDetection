`` Ah ! '' 
repeated Porthos . 
`` Dress yourself , my friend . '' 
And he helped the giant to dress himself , and thrust his gold and diamonds into his pocket . 
Whilst he was thus engaged , a slight noise attracted his attention , and on looking up , he saw D'Artagnan watching them through the half-opened door . 
Aramis started . 
`` What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` We are going off on a mission of great importance , '' added the bishop . 
`` You are very fortunate , '' said the musketeer . 
`` Oh , dear me ! '' 
said Porthos , `` I feel so wearied ; I would far sooner have been fast asleep . 
But the service of the king ... '' `` Have you seen M. Fouquet ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` Yes , this very minute , in a carriage . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' '' 
` Adieu ; ' nothing more . '' 
`` Was that all ? '' 
`` What else do you think he could say ? 
Am I worth anything now , since you have got into such high favor ? '' 
`` Listen , '' said Aramis , embracing the musketeer ; `` your good times are returning again . 
You will have no occasion to be jealous of any one . '' 
`` Ah ! 
bah ! '' 
`` I predict that something will happen to you to-day which will increase your importance more than ever . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` You know that I know all the news ? '' 
`` Oh , yes ! '' 
`` Come , Porthos , are you ready ? 
Let us go . '' 
`` I am quite ready , Aramis . '' 
`` Let us embrace D'Artagnan first . '' 
`` Most certainly . '' 
`` But the horses ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
there is no want of them here . 
Will you have mine ? '' 
`` No ; Porthos has his own stud . 
So adieu ! 
adieu ! '' 
The fugitives mounted their horses beneath the very eyes of the captain of the musketeers , who held Porthos 's stirrup for him , and gazed after them until they were out of sight . 
`` On any other occasion , '' thought the Gascon , `` I should say that those gentlemen were making their escape ; but in these days politics seem so changed that such an exit is termed going on a mission . 
I have no objection ; let me attend to my own affairs , that is more than enough for me , '' - and he philosophically entered his apartments . 
: Showing How the Countersign Was Respected at the Bastile . 
Fouquet tore along as fast as his horses could drag him . 
On his way he trembled with horror at the idea of what had just been revealed to him . 
`` What must have been , '' he thought , `` the youth of those extraordinary men , who , even as age is stealing fast upon them , are still able to conceive such gigantic plans , and carry them through without a tremor ? '' 
At one moment he could not resist the idea that all Aramis had just been recounting to him was nothing more than a dream , and whether the fable itself was not the snare ; so that when Fouquet arrived at the Bastile , he might possibly find an order of arrest , which would send him to join the dethroned king .
