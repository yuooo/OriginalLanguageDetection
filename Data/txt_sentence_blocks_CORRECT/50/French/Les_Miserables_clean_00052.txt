she exclaimed , `` does your Grace know where the basket of silver is ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the Bishop . 
`` Jesus the Lord be blessed ! '' 
she resumed ; `` I did not know what had become of it . '' 
The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed . 
He presented it to Madame Magloire . 
`` Here it is . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said she . 
`` Nothing in it ! 
And the silver ? '' 
`` Ah , '' returned the Bishop , `` so it is the silver which troubles you ? 
I do n't know where it is . '' 
`` Great , good God ! 
It is stolen ! 
That man who was here last night has stolen it . '' 
In a twinkling , with all the vivacity of an alert old woman , Madame Magloire had rushed to the oratory , entered the alcove , and returned to the Bishop . 
The Bishop had just bent down , and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons , which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed . 
He rose up at Madame Magloire 's cry . 
`` Monseigneur , the man is gone ! 
The silver has been stolen ! '' 
As she uttered this exclamation , her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden , where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible . 
The coping of the wall had been torn away . 
`` Stay ! 
yonder is the way he went . 
He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane . 
Ah , the abomination ! 
He has stolen our silver ! '' 
The Bishop remained silent for a moment ; then he raised his grave eyes , and said gently to Madame Magloire : -- `` And , in the first place , was that silver ours ? '' 
Madame Magloire was speechless . 
Another silence ensued ; then the Bishop went on : -- `` Madame Magloire , I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully . 
It belonged to the poor . 
Who was that man ? 
A poor man , evidently . '' 
`` Alas ! 
Jesus ! '' 
returned Madame Magloire . 
`` It is not for my sake , nor for Mademoiselle 's . 
It makes no difference to us . 
But it is for the sake of Monseigneur . 
What is Monseigneur to eat with now ? '' 
The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement . 
`` Ah , come ! 
Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons ? '' 
Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders . 
`` Pewter has an odor . '' 
`` Iron forks and spoons , then . '' 
Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace . 
`` Iron has a taste . '' 
`` Very well , '' said the Bishop ; `` wooden ones then . ''
