`` Well ? '' 
`` I 'm sure that I know him . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` I 'm willing that they should cut my throat , and I 'm ready to swear that I never said either you , thou , or I , in my life , if I do n't know that Parisian . '' 
-LSB- pantinois . -RSB- 
`` Paris in Pantin to-day . '' 
`` Can you see the bride if you stoop down ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` And the bridegroom ? '' 
`` There 's no bridegroom in that trap . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` Unless it 's the old fellow . '' 
`` Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low . '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
`` Never mind , that old cove who has something the matter with his paw I know , and that I 'm positive . '' 
`` And what good does it do to know him ? '' 
`` No one can tell . 
Sometimes it does ! '' 
`` I do n't care a hang for old fellows , that I do n't ! '' 
`` I know him . '' 
`` Know him , if you want to . '' 
`` How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party ? '' 
`` We are in it , too . '' 
`` Where does that wedding come from ? '' 
`` How should I know ? '' 
`` Listen . '' 
`` Well , what ? '' 
`` There 's one thing you ought to do . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` Get off of our trap and spin that wedding . '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` To find out where it goes , and what it is . 
Hurry up and jump down , trot , my girl , your legs are young . '' 
`` I ca n't quit the vehicle . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` I 'm hired . '' 
`` Ah , the devil ! '' 
`` I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture . '' 
`` That 's true . '' 
`` If I leave the cart , the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me . 
You know that well enough . '' 
`` Yes , I do . '' 
`` I 'm bought by the government for to-day . '' 
`` All the same , that old fellow bothers me . '' 
`` Do the old fellows bother you ? 
But you 're not a young girl . '' 
`` He 's in the first carriage . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` In the bride 's trap . '' 
`` What then ? ''
