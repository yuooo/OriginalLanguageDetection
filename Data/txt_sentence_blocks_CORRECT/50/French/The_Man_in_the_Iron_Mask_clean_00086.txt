I understand , I understand ; you have the king in your power ; I understand . '' 
`` You understand nothing - as yet , '' replied Aramis , `` and again you interrupt me . 
Then , too , allow me to observe that you pay no attention to logical reasoning , and seem to forget what you ought most to remember . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our conversation ? '' 
`` Yes , his majesty 's hate , invincible hate for me ; yes , but what feeling of hate could resist the threat of such a revelation ? '' 
`` Such a revelation , do you say ? 
that is the very point where your logic fails you . 
What ! 
do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to the king , I should have been alive now ? '' 
`` It is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king . '' 
`` That may be . 
He might not have had the time to get me killed outright , but he would have had the time to get me gagged and thrown in a dungeon . 
Come , come , show a little consistency in your reasoning , mordieu ! '' 
And by the mere use of this word , which was so thoroughly his old musketeer 's expression , forgotten by one who never seemed to forget anything , Fouquet could not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation the calm , impenetrable bishop of Vannes had wrought himself . 
He shuddered . 
`` And then , '' replied the latter , after having mastered his feelings , `` should I be the man I really am , should I be the true friend you believe me , if I were to expose you , whom the king already hates so bitterly , to a feeling more than ever to be dreaded in that young man ? 
To have robbed him , is nothing ; to have addressed the woman he loves , is not much ; but to hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor , why , he would pluck out your heart with his own hands . '' 
`` You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret , then ? '' 
`` I would sooner , far sooner , have swallowed at one draught all the poisons that Mithridates drank in twenty years , in order to try and avoid death , than have betrayed my secret to the king . '' 
`` What have you done , then ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
now we are coming to the point , monseigneur . 
I think I shall not fail to excite in you a little interest . 
You are listening , I hope . '' 
`` How can you ask me if I am listening ? 
Go on . '' 
Aramis walked softly all round the room , satisfied himself that they were alone , and that all was silent , and then returned and placed himself close to the armchair in which Fouquet was seated , awaiting with the deepest anxiety the revelation he had to make . 
`` I forgot to tell you , '' resumed Aramis , addressing himself to Fouquet , who listened to him with the most absorbed attention - `` I forgot to mention a most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins , namely , that God had formed them so startlingly , so miraculously , like each other , that it would be utterly impossible to distinguish the one from the other . 
Their own mother would not be able to distinguish them . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
exclaimed Fouquet . 
`` The same noble character in their features , the same carriage , the same stature , the same voice . '' 
`` But their thoughts ? 
degree of intelligence ? 
their knowledge of human life ? '' 
`` There is inequality there , I admit , monseigneur . 
Yes ; for the prisoner of the Bastile is , most incontestably , superior in every way to his brother ; and if , from his prison , this unhappy victim were to pass to the throne , France would not , from the earliest period of its history , perhaps , have had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of character . '' 
Fouquet buried his face in his hands , as if he were overwhelmed by the weight of this immense secret . 
Aramis approached him . 
`` There is a further inequality , '' he said , continuing his work of temptation , `` an inequality which concerns yourself , monseigneur , between the twins , both sons of Louis XIII. , namely , the last comer does not know M. Colbert . '' 
Fouquet raised his head immediately - his features were pale and distorted . 
The bolt had hit its mark - not his heart , but his mind and comprehension . 
`` I understand you , '' he said to Aramis ; `` you are proposing a conspiracy to me ? '' 
`` Something like it . '' 
`` One of those attempts which , as you said at the beginning of this conversation , alters the fate of empires ? '' 
`` And of superintendents , too ; yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` In a word , you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the son of Louis XIII. , who is now a prisoner in the Bastile , for the son of Louis XIII. , who is at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus ? '' 
Aramis smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which was passing through his brain . 
`` Exactly , '' he said .
