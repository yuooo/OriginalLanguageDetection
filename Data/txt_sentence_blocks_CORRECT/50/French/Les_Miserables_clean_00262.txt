of real Paris Surene ? 
Ah ! 
So old Mestienne is dead ! 
I am sorry for it ; he was a jolly fellow . 
But you are a jolly fellow , too . 
Are you not , comrade ? 
We 'll go and have a drink together presently . '' 
The man replied : -- `` I have been a student . 
I passed my fourth examination . 
I never drink . '' 
The hearse had set out again , and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery . 
Fauchelevent had slackened his pace . 
He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity . 
The grave-digger walked on in front of him . 
Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review . 
He was one of those men who , though very young , have the air of age , and who , though slender , are extremely strong . 
`` Comrade ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
The man turned round . 
`` I am the convent grave-digger . '' 
`` My colleague , '' said the man . 
Fauchelevent , who was illiterate but very sharp , understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man , with a fine talker . 
He muttered : `` So Father Mestienne is dead . '' 
The man replied : -- `` Completely . 
The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the time is up . 
It was Father Mestienne 's turn . 
Father Mestienne died . '' 
Fauchelevent repeated mechanically : `` The good God -- '' `` The good God , '' said the man authoritatively . 
`` According to the philosophers , the Eternal Father ; according to the Jacobins , the Supreme Being . '' 
`` Shall we not make each other 's acquaintance ? '' 
stammered Fauchelevent . 
`` It is made . 
You are a peasant , I am a Parisian . '' 
`` People do not know each other until they have drunk together . 
He who empties his glass empties his heart . 
You must come and have a drink with me . 
Such a thing can not be refused . '' 
`` Business first . '' 
Fauchelevent thought : `` I am lost . '' 
They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns ' corner . 
The grave-digger resumed : -- `` Peasant , I have seven small children who must be fed . 
As they must eat , I can not drink . '' 
And he added , with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well : -- `` Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst . '' 
The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees , quitted the grand alley , turned into a narrow one , entered the waste land , and plunged into a thicket . 
This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture . 
Fauchelevent slackened his pace , but he could not detain the hearse . 
Fortunately , the soil , which was light and wet with the winter rains , clogged the wheels and retarded its speed . 
He approached the grave-digger . 
`` They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine , '' murmured Fauchelevent . 
`` Villager , '' retorted the man , `` I ought not be a grave-digger .
