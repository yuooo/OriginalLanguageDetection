`` Ah ! 
gentlemen and friends ! 
it is because by speaking I betray the watchword . 
But , hark ! 
I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it . '' 
`` Cannon ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Cannon and musketry , too ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
On hearing at a distance , among the rocks , these sinister reports of a combat which they thought had ceased : `` What can that be ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
Pardieu ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` that is just what I expected . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint ; is not that true , monsieur ? 
And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed , you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the island . '' 
`` Oh ! 
several , monsieur . '' 
`` We are lost , then , '' said the bishop of Vannes , quietly . 
`` Lost ! 
that is possible , '' replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , `` but we are not taken or hung . '' 
And so saying , he rose from the table , went to the wall , and coolly took down his sword and pistols , which he examined with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle , and who feels that life , in a great measure , depends upon the excellence and right conditions of his arms . 
At the report of the cannon , at the news of the surprise which might deliver up the island to the royal troops , the terrified crowd rushed precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their leaders . 
Aramis , pale and downcast , between two flambeaux , showed himself at the window which looked into the principal court , full of soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor . 
`` My friends , '' said D'Herblay , in a grave and sonorous voice , `` M. Fouquet , your protector , your friend , you father , has been arrested by an order of the king , and thrown into the Bastile . '' 
A sustained yell of vengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood , and enveloped him in a magnetic field . 
`` Avenge Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
cried the most excited of his hearers , `` death to the royalists ! '' 
`` No , my friends , '' replied Aramis , solemnly ; `` no , my friends ; no resistance . 
The king is master in his kingdom . 
The king is the mandatory of God . 
The king and God have struck M. Fouquet . 
Humble yourselves before the hand of God . 
Love God and the king , who have struck M. Fouquet . 
But do not avenge your seigneur , do not think of avenging him . 
You would sacrifice yourselves in vain - you , your wives and children , your property , your liberty . 
Lay down your arms , my friends - lay down your arms ! 
since the king commands you so to do - and retire peaceably to your dwellings . 
It is I who ask you to do so ; it is I who beg you to do so ; it is I who now , in the hour of need , command you to do so , in the name of M. Fouquet . '' 
The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and terror . 
`` The soldiers of Louis XIV . 
have reached the island , '' continued Aramis . 
`` From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them and you - it would be a massacre . 
Begone , then , begone , and forget ; this time I command you , in the name of the Lord of Hosts ! '' 
The mutineers retired slowly , submissive , silent . 
`` Ah ! 
what have you just been saying , my friend ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Biscarrat to the bishop , `` you may save all these inhabitants , but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend . ''
