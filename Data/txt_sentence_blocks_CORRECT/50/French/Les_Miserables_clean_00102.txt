What is the meaning of this ? 
What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me ? 
What have you done to me ? 
What are your wrongs with regard to me ? 
You accuse yourself ; you wish to be superseded -- '' `` Turned out , '' said Javert . 
`` Turned out ; so it be , then . 
That is well . 
I do not understand . '' 
`` You shall understand , Mr. Mayor . '' 
Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest , and resumed , still coldly and sadly : -- `` Mr. Mayor , six weeks ago , in consequence of the scene over that woman , I was furious , and I informed against you . '' 
`` Informed against me ! '' 
`` At the Prefecture of Police in Paris . '' 
M. Madeleine , who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than Javert himself , burst out laughing now : -- `` As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police ? '' 
`` As an ex-convict . '' 
The mayor turned livid . 
Javert , who had not raised his eyes , went on : -- `` I thought it was so . 
I had had an idea for a long time ; a resemblance ; inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles ; the strength of your loins ; the adventure with old Fauchelevant ; your skill in marksmanship ; your leg , which you drag a little ; -- I hardly know what all , -- absurdities ! 
But , at all events , I took you for a certain Jean Valjean . '' 
`` A certain -- What did you say the name was ? '' 
`` Jean Valjean . 
He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago , when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon . 
On leaving the galleys , this Jean Valjean , as it appears , robbed a bishop ; then he committed another theft , accompanied with violence , on a public highway on the person of a little Savoyard . 
He disappeared eight years ago , no one knows how , and he has been sought , I fancied . 
In short , I did this thing ! 
Wrath impelled me ; I denounced you at the Prefecture ! '' 
M. Madeleine , who had taken up the docket again several moments before this , resumed with an air of perfect indifference : -- `` And what reply did you receive ? '' 
`` That I was mad . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , they were right . '' 
`` It is lucky that you recognize the fact . '' 
`` I am forced to do so , since the real Jean Valjean has been found . '' 
The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his hand ; he raised his head , gazed fixedly at Javert , and said with his indescribable accent : -- `` Ah ! '' 
Javert continued : -- `` This is the way it is , Mr. Mayor . 
It seems that there was in the neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called Father Champmathieu . 
He was a very wretched creature . 
No one paid any attention to him . 
No one knows what such people subsist on . 
Lately , last autumn , Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from -- Well , no matter , a theft had been committed , a wall scaled , branches of trees broken . 
My Champmathieu was arrested . 
He still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand . 
The scamp is locked up . 
Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor . 
But here is where Providence intervened . 
`` The jail being in a bad condition , the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras , where the departmental prison is situated . 
In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet , who is detained for I know not what , and who has been appointed turnkey of the house , because of good behavior . 
Mr. Mayor , no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims : ` Eh ! 
Why , I know that man ! 
He is a fagot ! 
-LSB- 4 -RSB- Take a good look at me , my good man ! 
You are Jean Valjean ! '
