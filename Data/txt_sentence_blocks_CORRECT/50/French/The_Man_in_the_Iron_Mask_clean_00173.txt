: Explanations by Aramis . 
`` What I have to say to you , friend Porthos , will probably surprise you , but it may prove instructive . '' 
`` I like to be surprised , '' said Porthos , in a kindly tone ; `` do not spare me , therefore , I beg . 
I am hardened against emotions ; do n't fear , speak out . '' 
`` It is difficult , Porthos - difficult ; for , in truth , I warn you a second time , I have very strange things , very extraordinary things , to tell you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you speak so well , my friend , that I could listen to you for days together . 
Speak , then , I beg - and - stop , I have an idea : I will , to make your task more easy , I will , to assist you in telling me such things , question you . '' 
`` I shall be pleased at your doing so . '' 
`` What are we going to fight for , Aramis ? '' 
`` If you ask me many such questions as that - if you would render my task the easier by interrupting my revelations thus , Porthos , you will not help me at all . 
So far , on the contrary , that is the very Gordian knot . 
But , my friend , with a man like you , good , generous , and devoted , the confession must be bravely made . 
I have deceived you , my worthy friend . '' 
`` You have deceived me ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
yes . '' 
`` Was it for my good , Aramis ? '' 
`` I thought so , Porthos ; I thought so sincerely , my friend . '' 
`` Then , '' said the honest seigneur of Bracieux , `` you have rendered me a service , and I thank you for it ; for if you had not deceived me , I might have deceived myself . 
In what , then , have you deceived me , tell me ? '' 
`` In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV. , at this moment , is directing his efforts . '' 
`` The usurper ! '' 
said Porthos , scratching his head . 
`` That is - well , I do not quite clearly comprehend ! '' 
`` He is one of the two kings who are contending fro the crown of France . '' 
`` Very well ! 
Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` You have hit the matter in one word . '' 
`` It follows that - '' `` It follows that we are rebels , my poor friend . '' 
`` The devil ! 
the devil ! '' 
cried Porthos , much disappointed . 
`` Oh ! 
but , dear Porthos , be calm , we shall still find means of getting out of the affair , trust me . '' 
`` It is not that which makes me uneasy , '' replied Porthos ; `` that which alone touches me is that ugly word rebels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
but - '' `` And so , according to this , the duchy that was promised me - '' `` It was the usurper that was to give it to you . '' 
`` And that is not the same thing , Aramis , '' said Porthos , majestically . 
`` My friend , if it had only depended upon me , you should have become a prince . '' 
Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way . 
`` That is where you have been wrong , '' continued he , `` in deceiving me ; for that promised duchy I reckoned upon . 
Oh ! 
I reckoned upon it seriously , knowing you to be a man of your word , Aramis . '' 
`` Poor Porthos ! 
pardon me , I implore you ! '' 
`` So , then , '' continued Porthos , without replying to the bishop 's prayer , `` so then , it seems , I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I will settle all that , my good friend , I will settle all that . 
I will take it on myself alone ! ''
