`` Cosette ! 
... '' stammered Marius . 
And he paused . 
One would have said that they were two criminals . 
Cosette , who was radiant , continued to gaze at both of them . 
There was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise . 
`` I have caught you in the very act , '' said Cosette . 
`` Just now , I heard my father Fauchelevent through the door saying : ` Conscience ... doing my duty ... ' That is politics , indeed it is . 
I will not have it . 
People should not talk politics the very next day . 
It is not right . '' 
`` You are mistaken . 
Cosette , '' said Marius , `` we are talking business . 
We are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs ... '' `` That is not it at all '' interrupted Cosette . 
`` I am coming . 
Does any body want me here ? '' 
And , passing resolutely through the door , she entered the drawing-room . 
She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown , with a thousand folds and large sleeves which , starting from the neck , fell to her feet . 
In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures , there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels . 
She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror , then exclaimed , in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy : `` There was once a King and a Queen . 
Oh ! 
how happy I am ! '' 
That said , she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean . 
`` There , '' said she , `` I am going to install myself near you in an easy-chair , we breakfast in half an hour , you shall say anything you like , I know well that men must talk , and I will be very good . '' 
Marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her : `` We are talking business . '' 
`` By the way , '' said Cosette , `` I have opened my window , a flock of pierrots has arrived in the garden , -- Birds , not maskers . 
To-day is Ash-Wednesday ; but not for the birds . '' 
`` I tell you that we are talking business , go , my little Cosette , leave us alone for a moment . 
We are talking figures . 
That will bore you . '' 
`` You have a charming cravat on this morning , Marius . 
You are very dandified , monseigneur . 
No , it will not bore me . '' 
`` I assure you that it will bore you . '' 
`` No . 
Since it is you . 
I shall not understand you , but I shall listen to you . 
When one hears the voices of those whom one loves , one does not need to understand the words that they utter . 
That we should be here together -- that is all that I desire . 
I shall remain with you , bah ! '' 
`` You are my beloved Cosette ! 
Impossible . '' 
`` Impossible ! '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Very good , '' said Cosette . 
`` I was going to tell you some news . 
I could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep , that your aunt is at mass , that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent 's room smokes , that Nicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep , that Toussaint and Nicolette have already quarrelled , that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint 's stammer . 
Well , you shall know nothing . 
Ah ! 
it is impossible ?
