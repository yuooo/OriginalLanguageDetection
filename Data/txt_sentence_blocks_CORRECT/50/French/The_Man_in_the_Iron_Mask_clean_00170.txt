An old fisherman passed . 
`` Are those our barks , yonder ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
The old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon . 
`` No , monseigneur , '' replied he , `` they are lighter boars , boats in the king 's service . '' 
`` Boats in the royal service ? '' 
replied Aramis , starting . 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
said he . 
`` By the flag . '' 
`` But , '' said Porthos , `` the boat is scarcely visible ; how the devil , my friend , can you distinguish the flag ? '' 
`` I see there is one , '' replied the old man ; `` our boats , trade lighters , do not carry any . 
That sort of craft is generally used for transport of troops . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
groaned Aramis . 
`` Vivat ! '' 
cried Porthos , `` they are sending us reinforcements , do n't you think they are , Aramis ? '' 
`` Probably . '' 
`` Unless it is the English coming . '' 
`` By the Loire ? 
That would have an evil look , Porthos ; for they must have come through Paris ! '' 
`` You are right ; they are reinforcements , decidedly , or provisions . '' 
Aramis leaned his head upon his hands , and made no reply . 
Then , all at once , - `` Porthos , '' said he , `` have the alarm sounded . '' 
`` The alarm ! 
do you imagine such a thing ? '' 
`` Yes , and let the cannoniers mount their batteries , the artillerymen be at their pieces , and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries . '' 
Porthos opened his eyes to their widest extent . 
He looked attentively at his friend , to convince himself he was in his proper senses . 
`` I will do it , my dear Porthos , '' continued Aramis , in his blandest tone ; `` I will go and have these orders executed myself , if you do not go , my friend . '' 
`` Well ! 
I will - instantly ! '' 
said Porthos , who went to execute the orders , casting all the while looks behind him , to see if the bishop of Vannes were not deceived ; and if , on recovering more rational ideas , he would not recall him . 
The alarm was sounded , trumpets brayed , drums rolled ; the great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry . 
The dikes and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers ; matches sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen , placed behind the large cannon bedded in their stone carriages . 
When every man was at his post , when all the preparations for defense were made : `` Permit me , Aramis , to try to comprehend , '' whispered Porthos , timidly , in Aramis 's ear . 
`` My dear friend , you will comprehend but too soon , '' murmured M. d'Herblay , in reply to this question of his lieutenant . 
`` The fleet which is coming yonder , with sails unfurled , straight towards the port of Belle-Isle , is a royal fleet , is it not ? '' 
`` But as there are two kings in France , Porthos , to which of these two kings does this fleet belong ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you open my eyes , '' replied the giant , stunned by the insinuation . 
And Porthos , whose eyes this reply of his friend 's had at last opened , or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight , went with his best speed to the batteries to overlook his people , and exhort every one to do his duty . 
In the meantime , Aramis , with his eye fixed on the horizon , saw the ships continually drawing nearer . 
The people and the soldiers , perched on the summits of the rocks , could distinguish the masts , then the lower sails , and at last the hulls of the lighters , bearing at the masthead the royal flag of France . 
It was night when one of these vessels , which had created such a sensation among the inhabitants of Belle-Isle , dropped anchor within cannon shot of the place . 
It was soon seen , notwithstanding the darkness , that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel , from the side of which a skiff was lowered , of which the three rowers , bending to their oars , took the direction of the port , and in a few instants struck land at the foot of the fort . 
The commander jumped ashore . 
He had a letter in his hand , which he waved in the air , and seemed to wish to communicate with somebody . 
This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of the pilots of the island . 
He was the captain of one of the two barks retained by Aramis , but which Porthos , in his anxiety with regard to the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared , had sent in search of the missing boats .
