`` Your daughter . '' 
It was , in fact , Eponine , who had addressed Thenardier . 
At the apparition of Eponine , the other five , that is to say , Claquesous , Guelemer , Babet , Brujon , and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near , without precipitation , without uttering a word , with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night . 
Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands . 
Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons . 
`` Ah , see here , what are you about there ? 
What do you want with us ? 
Are you crazy ? '' 
exclaimed Thenardier , as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low ; `` what have you come here to hinder our work for ? '' 
Eponine burst out laughing , and threw herself on his neck . 
`` I am here , little father , because I am here . 
Is n't a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays ? 
It 's you who ought not to be here . 
What have you come here for , since it 's a biscuit ? 
I told Magnon so . 
There 's nothing to be done here . 
But embrace me , my good little father ! 
It 's a long time since I 've seen you ! 
So you 're out ? '' 
Thenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponine 's arms , and grumbled : -- `` That 's good . 
You 've embraced me . 
Yes , I 'm out . 
I 'm not in . 
Now , get away with you . '' 
But Eponine did not release her hold , and redoubled her caresses . 
`` But how did you manage it , little pa ? 
You must have been very clever to get out of that . 
Tell me about it ! 
And my mother ? 
Where is mother ? 
Tell me about mamma . '' 
Thenardier replied : -- `` She 's well . 
I do n't know , let me alone , and be off , I tell you . 
`` I wo n't go , so there now , '' pouted Eponine like a spoiled child ; `` you send me off , and it 's four months since I saw you , and I 've hardly had time to kiss you . '' 
And she caught her father round the neck again . 
`` Come , now , this is stupid ! '' 
said Babet . 
`` Make haste ! '' 
said Guelemer , `` the cops may pass . '' 
The ventriloquist 's voice repeated his distich : -- `` Nous n ' sommes pas le jour de l'an , `` This is n't New Year 's day A becoter papa , maman . '' 
To peck at pa and ma . '' 
Eponine turned to the five ruffians . 
`` Why , it 's Monsieur Brujon . 
Good day , Monsieur Babet . 
Good day , Monsieur Claquesous . 
Do n't you know me , Monsieur Guelemer ? 
How goes it , Montparnasse ? '' 
`` Yes , they know you ! '' 
ejaculated Thenardier . 
`` But good day , good evening , sheer off !
