Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread , and had reached the angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets , at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of La Force was visible : -- `` Hullo , is that you , Gavroche ? '' 
said some one . 
`` Hullo , is that you , Montparnasse ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
A man had just accosted the street urchin , and the man was no other than Montparnasse in disguise , with blue spectacles , but recognizable to Gavroche . 
`` The bow-wows ! '' 
went on Gavroche , `` you 've got a hide the color of a linseed plaster , and blue specs like a doctor . 
You 're putting on style , ` pon my word ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
ejaculated Montparnasse , `` not so loud . '' 
And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops . 
The two little ones followed mechanically , holding each other by the hand . 
When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere , sheltered from the rain and from all eyes : -- `` Do you know where I 'm going ? '' 
demanded Montparnasse . 
`` To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret , '' -LSB- 36 -RSB- replied Gavroche . 
-LSB- 36 -RSB- The scaffold . 
`` Joker ! '' 
And Montparnasse went on : -- `` I 'm going to find Babet . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche , `` so her name is Babet . '' 
Montparnasse lowered his voice : -- `` Not she , he . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Babet . '' 
`` Yes , Babet . '' 
`` I thought he was buckled . '' 
`` He has undone the buckle , '' replied Montparnasse . 
And he rapidly related to the gamin how , on the morning of that very day , Babet , having been transferred to La Conciergerie , had made his escape , by turning to the left instead of to the right in `` the police office . '' 
Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill . 
`` What a dentist ! '' 
he cried . 
Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet 's flight , and ended with : -- `` Oh ! 
That 's not all . '' 
Gavroche , as he listened , had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in his hand , and mechanically pulled at the upper part , and the blade of a dagger made its appearance . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he exclaimed , pushing the dagger back in haste , `` you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois . '' 
Montparnasse winked . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
resumed Gavroche , `` so you 're going to have a bout with the bobbies ? '' 
`` You ca n't tell , '' replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air . 
`` It 's always a good thing to have a pin about one . '' 
Gavroche persisted : -- `` What are you up to to-night ? '' 
Again Montparnasse took a grave tone , and said , mouthing every syllable : `` Things . '' 
And abruptly changing the conversation : -- `` By the way ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Something happened t ` other day . 
Fancy . 
I meet a bourgeois . 
He makes me a present of a sermon and his purse . 
I put it in my pocket . 
A minute later , I feel in my pocket .
