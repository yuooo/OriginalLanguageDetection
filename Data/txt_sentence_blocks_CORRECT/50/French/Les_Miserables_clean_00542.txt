There ; I no longer suffer . '' 
She remained silent for a moment , then she turned her face with an effort , and looked at Marius . 
`` Do you know what , Monsieur Marius ? 
It puzzled me because you entered that garden ; it was stupid , because it was I who showed you that house ; and then , I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you -- '' She paused , and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind , she resumed with a heartrending smile : -- `` You thought me ugly , did n't you ? '' 
She continued : -- `` You see , you are lost ! 
Now , no one can get out of the barricade . 
It was I who led you here , by the way ! 
You are going to die , I count upon that . 
And yet , when I saw them taking aim at you , I put my hand on the muzzle of the gun . 
How queer it is ! 
But it was because I wanted to die before you . 
When I received that bullet , I dragged myself here , no one saw me , no one picked me up , I was waiting for you , I said : ` So he is not coming ! ' 
Oh , if you only knew . 
I bit my blouse , I suffered so ! 
Now I am well . 
Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked at myself in your mirror , and the day when I came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen ? 
How the birds sang ! 
That was a long time ago . 
You gave me a hundred sous , and I said to you : ` I do n't want your money . ' 
I hope you picked up your coin ? 
You are not rich . 
I did not think to tell you to pick it up . 
The sun was shining bright , and it was not cold . 
Do you remember , Monsieur Marius ? 
Oh ! 
How happy I am ! 
Every one is going to die . '' 
She had a mad , grave , and heart-breaking air . 
Her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat . 
As she talked , she pressed her pierced hand to her breast , where there was another hole , and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood , like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole . 
Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she resumed , `` it is coming again , I am stifling ! '' 
She caught up her blouse and bit it , and her limbs stiffened on the pavement . 
At that moment the young cock 's crow executed by little Gavroche resounded through the barricade . 
The child had mounted a table to load his gun , and was singing gayly the song then so popular : -- `` En voyant Lafayette , `` On beholding Lafayette , Le gendarme repete : -- The gendarme repeats : -- Sauvons nous ! 
sauvons nous ! 
Let us flee ! 
let us flee ! 
sauvons nous ! '' 
let us flee ! 
Eponine raised herself and listened ; then she murmured : -- `` It is he . '' 
And turning to Marius : -- `` My brother is here . 
He must not see me . 
He would scold me . '' 
`` Your brother ? '' 
inquired Marius , who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thenardiers which his father had bequeathed to him ; `` who is your brother ? '' 
`` That little fellow . '' 
`` The one who is singing ? '' 
`` Yes . ''
