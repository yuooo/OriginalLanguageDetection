They intended to bring up the child in their own way . 
Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions , but he submitted to them , thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself . 
The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much ; but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable . 
This aunt , who had remained unmarried , was very rich on the maternal side , and her sister 's son was her natural heir . 
The boy , whose name was Marius , knew that he had a father , but nothing more . 
No one opened his mouth to him about it . 
Nevertheless , in the society into which his grandfather took him , whispers , innuendoes , and winks , had eventually enlightened the little boy 's mind ; he had finally understood something of the case , and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were , so to speak , the air he breathed , by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration , he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart . 
While he was growing up in this fashion , the colonel slipped away every two or three months , came to Paris on the sly , like a criminal breaking his ban , and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice , at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass . 
There , trembling lest the aunt should turn round , concealed behind a pillar , motionless , not daring to breathe , he gazed at his child . 
The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster . 
From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon , M. l'Abbe Mabeuf . 
That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice , who had often observed this man gazing at his child , and the scar on his cheek , and the large tears in his eyes . 
That man , who had so manly an air , yet who was weeping like a woman , had struck the warden . 
That face had clung to his mind . 
One day , having gone to Vernon to see his brother , he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge , and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice . 
The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure , and both had paid the colonel a visit , on some pretext or other . 
This visit led to others . 
The colonel , who had been extremely reserved at first , ended by opening his heart , and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history , and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child 's future . 
This caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness , and the colonel , on his side , became fond of the cure . 
And moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier . 
At bottom , the man is the same . 
The one has devoted his life to his country here below , the other to his country on high ; that is the only difference . 
Twice a year , on the first of January and on St. George 's day , Marius wrote duty letters to his father , which were dictated by his aunt , and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula ; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated ; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread . 
REQUIESCANT Madame de T. 's salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world . 
It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life . 
This opening was sombre , and more cold than warmth , more night than day , came to him through this skylight . 
This child , who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world , soon became melancholy , and , what is still more contrary to his age , grave . 
Surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages , he gazed about him with serious amazement . 
Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him . 
There were in Madame de T. 's salon some very noble ladies named Mathan , Noe , Levis , -- which was pronounced Levi , -- Cambis , pronounced Cambyse . 
These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child 's mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart , and when they were all there , seated in a circle around a dying fire , sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green , with their severe profiles , their gray or white hair , their long gowns of another age , whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished , dropping , at rare intervals , words which were both majestic and severe , little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes , in the conviction that he beheld not women , but patriarchs and magi , not real beings , but phantoms . 
With these phantoms , priests were sometimes mingled , frequenters of this ancient salon , and some gentlemen ; the Marquis de Sass **** , private secretary to Madame de Berry , the Vicomte de Val *** , who published , under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine , monorhymed odes , the Prince de Beauff ******* , who , though very young , had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife , whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows , the Marquis de C ***** d' E ****** , the man in all France who best understood `` proportioned politeness , '' the Comte d'Am ***** , the kindly man with the amiable chin , and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy , a pillar of the library of the Louvre , called the King 's cabinet , M. de Port-de-Guy , bald , and rather aged than old , was wont to relate that in 1793 , at the age of sixteen , he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian , the Bishop of Mirepoix , also refractory , but as a priest , while he was so in the capacity of a soldier . 
This was at Toulon . 
Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day ; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses , and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck , which was dry in the morning and wet at night . 
These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T. 's salon , and by dint of cursing Marat , they applauded Trestaillon . 
Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there ; M. Thibord du Chalard , M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt , and the celebrated scoffer of the right , M. Cornet-Dincourt . 
The bailiff de Ferrette , with his short breeches and his thin legs , sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand . 
He had been M. le Comte d'Artois ' companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe , he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours , and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff . 
As for the priests , there was the Abbe Halma , the same to whom M. Larose , his collaborator on la Foudre , said : `` Bah ! 
Who is there who is not fifty years old ? 
a few greenhorns perhaps ? '' 
The Abbe Letourneur , preacher to the King , the Abbe Frayssinous , who was not , as yet , either count , or bishop , or minister , or peer , and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing , and the Abbe Keravenant , Cure of Saint-Germain-des-Pres ; also the Pope 's Nuncio , then Monsignor Macchi , Archbishop of Nisibi , later on Cardinal , remarkable for his long , pensive nose , and another Monsignor , entitled thus : Abbate Palmieri , domestic prelate , one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See , Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica , Advocate of the saints , Postulatore dei Santi , which refers to matters of canonization , and signifies very nearly : Master of Requests of the section of Paradise . 
Lastly , two cardinals , M. de la Luzerne , and M. de Cl ****** T ******* . 
The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have , a few years later , the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand ; M. de Cl ****** T ******* was Archbishop of Toul **** , and often made trips to Paris , to his nephew , the Marquis de T ******* , who was Minister of Marine and War . 
The Cardinal of Cl ****** T ******* was a merry little man , who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock ; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopaedia , and his desperate play at billiards , and persons who , at that epoch , passed through the Rue M ***** on summer evenings , where the hotel de Cl ****** T ******* then stood , halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist , Monseigneur Cotiret , Bishop in partibus of Caryste : `` Mark , Abbe , I make a cannon . '' 
The Cardinal de Cl ****** T ******* had been brought to Madame de T. 's by his most intimate friend , M. de Roquelaure , former Bishop of Senlis , and one of the Forty . 
M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy ; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings , the curious could , on every Tuesday , contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis , usually standing erect , freshly powdered , in violet hose , with his back turned to the door , apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar . 
All these ecclesiastics , though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen , added to the gravity of the T. salon , whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France , the Marquis de Vib **** , the Marquis de Tal *** , the Marquis de Herb ******* , the Vicomte Damb *** , and the Duc de Val ******** . 
This Duc de Val ******** , although Prince de Mon *** , that is to say a reigning prince abroad , had so high an idea of France and its peerage , that he viewed everything through their medium . 
It was he who said : `` The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome ; the lords are the peers of France of England . ''
