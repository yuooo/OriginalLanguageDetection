let us go to the bottom of it ! 
We must scent out the truth ; dig in the earth for it , and seize it . 
Then it gives you exquisite joys . 
Then you grow strong , and you laugh . 
I am square on the bottom , I am . 
Immortality , Bishop , is a chance , a waiting for dead men 's shoes . 
Ah ! 
what a charming promise ! 
trust to it , if you like ! 
What a fine lot Adam has ! 
We are souls , and we shall be angels , with blue wings on our shoulder-blades . 
Do come to my assistance : is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star ? 
Very well . 
We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars . 
And then , besides , we shall see God . 
Ta , ta , ta ! 
What twaddle all these paradises are ! 
God is a nonsensical monster . 
I would not say that in the Moniteur , egad ! 
but I may whisper it among friends . 
Inter pocula . 
To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow . 
Be the dupe of the infinite ! 
I 'm not such a fool . 
I am a nought . 
I call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought , senator . 
Did I exist before my birth ? 
No . 
Shall I exist after death ? 
No . 
What am I ? 
A little dust collected in an organism . 
What am I to do on this earth ? 
The choice rests with me : suffer or enjoy . 
Whither will suffering lead me ? 
To nothingness ; but I shall have suffered . 
Whither will enjoyment lead me ? 
To nothingness ; but I shall have enjoyed myself . 
My choice is made . 
One must eat or be eaten . 
I shall eat . 
It is better to be the tooth than the grass . 
Such is my wisdom . 
After which , go whither I push thee , the grave-digger is there ; the Pantheon for some of us : all falls into the great hole . 
End . 
Finis . 
Total liquidation . 
This is the vanishing-point . 
Death is death , believe me . 
I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject .
