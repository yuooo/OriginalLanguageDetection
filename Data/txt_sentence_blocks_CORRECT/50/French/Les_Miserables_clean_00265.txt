`` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin . 
The coffin gave back a hollow sound . 
Fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself . 
He shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle : -- `` Comrade ! 
Before the Bon Coing is shut ! '' 
The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel . 
Fauchelevent continued . 
`` I will pay . '' 
And he seized the man 's arm . 
`` Listen to me , comrade . 
I am the convent grave-digger , I have come to help you . 
It is a business which can be performed at night . 
Let us begin , then , by going for a drink . '' 
And as he spoke , and clung to this desperate insistence , this melancholy reflection occurred to him : `` And if he drinks , will he get drunk ? '' 
`` Provincial , '' said the man , `` if you positively insist upon it , I consent . 
We will drink . 
After work , never before . '' 
And he flourished his shovel briskly . 
Fauchelevent held him back . 
`` It is Argenteuil wine , at six . '' 
`` Oh , come , '' said the grave-digger , `` you are a bell-ringer . 
Ding dong , ding dong , that 's all you know how to say . 
Go hang yourself . '' 
And he threw in a second shovelful . 
Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying . 
`` Come along and drink , '' he cried , `` since it is I who pays the bill . '' 
`` When we have put the child to bed , '' said the grave-digger . 
He flung in a third shovelful . 
Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added : -- `` It 's cold to-night , you see , and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet . '' 
At that moment , as he loaded his shovel , the grave-digger bent over , and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped . 
Fauchelevent 's wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket , and there it stopped . 
The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon ; there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket . 
The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain , traversed Fauchelevent 's pupils . 
An idea had just occurred to him . 
He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind , without the grave-digger , who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth , observing it , and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it . 
The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave . 
Just as he turned round to get the fifth , Fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said : -- `` By the way , you new man , have you your card ? '' 
The grave-digger paused . 
`` What card ? '' 
`` The sun is on the point of setting . '' 
`` That 's good , it is going to put on its nightcap . '' 
`` The gate of the cemetery will close immediately . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Have you your card ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my card ? '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he fumbled in his pocket .
