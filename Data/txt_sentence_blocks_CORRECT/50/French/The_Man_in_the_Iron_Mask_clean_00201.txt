- To the castle , then ! '' 
He returned thither . 
M. de Lyonne was coming out . 
He gave D'Artagnan both hands , but told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening and all night , and that orders had been given that no one should be admitted . 
`` Not even the captain who takes the order ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I think that is rather too strong . '' 
`` Not even he , '' said M. de Lyonne . 
`` Since that is the case , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the heart ; `` since the captain of the musketeers , who has always entered the king 's chamber , is no longer allowed to enter it , his cabinet , or his salle-a - manger , either the king is dead , or his captain is in disgrace . 
Do me the favor , then , M. de Lyonne , who are in favor , to return and tell the king , plainly , I send him my resignation . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , beware of what you are doing ! '' 
`` For friendship 's sake , go ! '' 
and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet . 
`` Well , I will go , '' said Lyonne . 
D'Artagnan waited , walking about the corridor in no enviable mood . 
Lyonne returned . 
`` Well , what did the king say ? '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` He simply answered , '' Tis well , ' '' replied Lyonne . 
`` That it was well ! '' 
said the captain , with an explosion . 
`` That is to say , that he accepts it ? 
Good ! 
Now , then , I am free ! 
I am only a plain citizen , M. de Lyonne . 
I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye ! 
Farewell , castle , corridor , ante-chamber ! 
a bourgeois , about to breathe at liberty , takes his farewell of you . '' 
And without waiting longer , the captain sprang from the terrace down the staircase , where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville 's letter . 
Five minutes after , he was at the hostelry , where , according to the custom of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle , he had taken what was called his city-chamber . 
But when he arrived there , instead of throwing off his sword and cloak , he took his pistols , put his money into a large leather purse , sent for his horses from the castle - stables , and gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes during the night . 
Everything went on according to his wishes . 
At eight o'clock in the evening , he was putting his foot in the stirrup , when M. de Gesvres appeared , at the head of twelve guards , in front of the hostelry . 
D'Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye ; he could not fail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses . 
But he feigned not to observe anything , and was about to put his horse in motion . 
Gesvres rode up to him . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
said he , aloud . 
`` Ah , Monsieur de Gesvres ! 
good evening ! '' 
`` One would say you were getting on horseback . '' 
`` More than that , - I am mounted , - as you see . '' 
`` It is fortunate I have met with you . '' 
`` Were you looking for me , then ? '' 
`` Mon Dieu ! 
yes . '' 
`` On the part of the king , I will wager ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` As I , three days ago , went in search of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Oh ! ''
