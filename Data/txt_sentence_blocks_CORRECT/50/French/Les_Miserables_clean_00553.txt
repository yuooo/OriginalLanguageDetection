And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread . 
All at once , Gavroche , pushing his cart in front of him , and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes , found himself face to face with a uniform , a shako , a plume , and a gun . 
For the second time , he stopped short . 
`` Hullo , '' said he , `` it 's him . 
Good day , public order . '' 
Gavroche 's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed . 
`` Where are you going , you rascal ? '' 
shouted the sergeant . 
`` Citizen , '' retorted Gavroche , `` I have n't called you ` bourgeois ' yet . 
Why do you insult me ? '' 
`` Where are you going , you rogue ? '' 
`` Monsieur , '' retorted Gavroche , `` perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday , but you have degenerated this morning . '' 
`` I ask you where are you going , you villain ? '' 
Gavroche replied : -- `` You speak prettily . 
Really , no one would suppose you as old as you are . 
You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece . 
That would yield you five hundred francs . '' 
`` Where are you going ? 
Where are you going ? 
Where are you going , bandit ? '' 
Gavroche retorted again : -- `` What villainous words ! 
You must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck . '' 
The sergeant lowered his bayonet . 
`` Will you tell me where you are going , you wretch ? '' 
`` General , '' said Gavroche `` I 'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor . '' 
`` To arms ! '' 
shouted the sergeant . 
The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them ; Gavroche took in the whole situation at a glance . 
It was the cart which had told against him , it was the cart 's place to protect him . 
At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on Gavroche , the cart , converted into a projectile and launched with all the latter 's might , rolled down upon him furiously , and the sergeant , struck full in the stomach , tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air . 
The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant 's shout ; the shot brought on a general random discharge , after which they reloaded their weapons and began again . 
This blind-man 's - buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several panes of glass . 
In the meanwhile , Gavroche , who had retraced his steps at full speed , halted five or six streets distant and seated himself , panting , on the stone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges . 
He listened . 
After panting for a few minutes , he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging , lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times , as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand ; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom has condensed French irony , and which is evidently efficacious , since it has already lasted half a century . 
This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection . 
`` Yes , '' said he , `` I 'm splitting with laughter , I 'm twisting with delight , I abound in joy , but I 'm losing my way , I shall have to take a roundabout way . 
If I only reach the barricade in season ! '' 
Thereupon he set out again on a run . 
And as he ran : -- `` Ah , by the way , where was I ? '' 
said he . 
And he resumed his ditty , as he plunged rapidly through the streets , and this is what died away in the gloom : -- `` Mais il reste encore des bastilles , Et je vais mettre le hola Dans l'orde public que voila . 
Ou vont les belles filles , Lon la . 
`` Quelqu'un veut-il jouer aux quilles ? 
Tout l'ancien monde s ` ecroula Quand la grosse boule roula . 
Ou vont les belles filles , Lon la . 
`` Vieux bon peuple , a coups de bequilles , Cassons ce Louvre ou s ` etala La monarchie en falbala . 
Ou vont les belles filles , Lon la . 
`` Nous en avons force les grilles , Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour la , Tenait mal et se decolla . 
Ou vont les belles filles , Lon la . ''
