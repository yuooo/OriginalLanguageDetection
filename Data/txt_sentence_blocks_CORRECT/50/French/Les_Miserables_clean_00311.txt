Here is none of your heavy-sides , a student who studies , a greenhorn pedant , strong on letters , theology , science , and sapience , one of those dull wits cut by the square ; a pin by profession . 
He is an honorable idler who lounges , who practises country jaunts , who cultivates the grisette , who pays court to the fair sex , who is at this very moment , perhaps , with my mistress . 
Let us save him . 
Death to Blondeau ! ' 
At that moment , Blondeau dipped his pen in , all black with erasures in the ink , cast his yellow eyes round the audience room , and repeated for the third time : ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
I replied : ` Present ! ' 
This is why you were not crossed off . '' 
`` Monsieur ! 
-- '' said Marius . 
`` And why I was , '' added Laigle de Meaux . 
`` I do not understand you , '' said Marius . 
Laigle resumed : -- `` Nothing is more simple . 
I was close to the desk to reply , and close to the door for the purpose of flight . 
The professor gazed at me with a certain intensity . 
All of a sudden , Blondeau , who must be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau , skipped to the letter L. L is my letter . 
I am from Meaux , and my name is Lesgle . '' 
`` L'Aigle ! '' 
interrupted Marius , `` what fine name ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Blondeau came to this fine name , and called : ` Laigle ! ' 
I reply : ` Present ! ' 
Then Blondeau gazes at me , with the gentleness of a tiger , and says to me : ` lf you are Pontmercy , you are not Laigle . ' 
A phrase which has a disobliging air for you , but which was lugubrious only for me . 
That said , he crossed me off . '' 
Marius exclaimed : -- `` I am mortified , sir -- '' `` First of all , '' interposed Laigle , `` I demand permission to embalm Blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium . 
I will assume that he is dead . 
There will be no great change required in his gauntness , in his pallor , in his coldness , and in his smell . 
And I say : ` Erudimini qui judicatis terram . 
Here lies Blondeau , Blondeau the Nose , Blondeau Nasica , the ox of discipline , bos disciplinae , the bloodhound of the password , the angel of the roll-call , who was upright , square exact , rigid , honest , and hideous . 
God crossed him off as he crossed me off . ' '' 
Marius resumed : -- `` I am very sorry -- '' `` Young man , '' said Laigle de Meaux , `` let this serve you as a lesson . 
In future , be exact . '' 
`` I really beg you a thousand pardons . '' 
`` Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again . '' 
`` I am extremely sorry -- '' Laigle burst out laughing . 
`` And I am delighted . 
I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer . 
This erasure saves me . 
I renounce the triumphs of the bar . 
I shall not defend the widow , and I shall not attack the orphan . 
No more toga , no more stage . 
Here is my erasure all ready for me . 
It is to you that I am indebted for it , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you . 
Where do you live ? '' 
`` In this cab , '' said Marius . 
`` A sign of opulence , '' retorted Laigle calmly . 
`` I congratulate you . 
You have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum . '' 
At that moment , Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe . 
Marius smiled sadly .
