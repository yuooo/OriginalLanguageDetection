said D'Artagnan , reflecting in vain . 
`` Here ! '' 
cried an old man , white as snow , sitting bent in his carriage , which he caused to be thrown open to make room for the musketeer . 
`` Aramis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , struck with profound amazement . 
And he felt , inert as it was , the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round his neck . 
Colbert , after having observed them in silence for a few moments , urged his horse forward , and left the two old friends together . 
`` And so , '' said the musketeer , taking Aramis 's arm , `` you , the exile , the rebel , are again in France ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
and I shall dine with you at the king 's table , '' said Aramis , smiling . 
`` Yes , will you not ask yourself what is the use of fidelity in this world ? 
Stop ! 
let us allow poor La Valliere 's carriage to pass . 
Look , how uneasy she is ! 
How her eyes , dim with tears , follow the king , who is riding on horseback yonder ! '' 
`` With whom ? '' 
`` With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente , now Madame de Montespan , '' replied Aramis . 
`` She is jealous . 
Is she then deserted ? '' 
`` Not quite yet , but it will not be long before she is . '' 
-LRB- 9 -RRB- They chatted together , while following the sport , and Aramis 's coachman drove them so cleverly that they arrived at the instant when the falcon , attacking the bird , beat him down , and fell upon him . 
The king alighted ; Madame de Montespan followed his example . 
They were in front of an isolated chapel , concealed by huge trees , already despoiled of their leaves by the first cutting winds of autumn . 
Behind this chapel was an inclosure , closed by a latticed gate . 
The falcon had beaten down his prey in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel , and the king was desirous of going in to take the first feather , according to custom . 
The cortege formed a circle round the building and the hedges , too small to receive so many . 
D'Artagnan held back Aramis by the arm , as he was about , like the rest , to alight from his carriage , and in a hoarse , broken voice , `` Do you know , Aramis , '' said he , `` whither chance has conducted us ? '' 
`` No , '' replied the duke . 
`` Here repose men that we knew well , '' said D'Artagnan , greatly agitated . 
Aramis , without divining anything , and with a trembling step , penetrated into the chapel by a little door which D'Artagnan opened for him . 
`` Where are they buried ? '' 
said he . 
`` There , in the inclosure . 
There is a cross , you see , beneath yon little cypress . 
The tree of grief is planted over their tomb ; do n't go to it ; the king is going that way ; the heron has fallen just there . '' 
Aramis stopped , and concealed himself in the shade . 
They then saw , without being seen , the pale face of La Valliere , who , neglected in her carriage , at first looked on , with a melancholy heart , from the door , and then , carried away by jealousy , advanced into the chapel , whence , leaning against a pillar , she contemplated the king smiling and making signs to Madame de Montespan to approach , as there was nothing to be afraid of . 
Madame de Montespan complied ; she took the hand the king held out to her , and he , plucking out the first feather from the heron , which the falconer had strangled , placed it in his beautiful companion 's hat . 
She , smiling in her turn , kissed the hand tenderly which made her this present . 
The king grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure ; he looked at Madame de Montespan with all the fire of new love . 
`` What will you give me in exchange ? '' 
said he . 
She broke off a little branch of cypress and offered it to the king , who looked intoxicated with hope . 
`` Humph ! '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan ; `` the present is but a sad one , for that cypress shades a tomb . '' 
`` Yes , and the tomb is that of Raoul de Bragelonne , '' said D'Artagnan aloud ; `` of Raoul , who sleeps under that cross with his father . '' 
A groan resounded - they saw a woman fall fainting to the ground . 
Mademoiselle de la Valliere had seen all , heard all . 
`` Poor woman ! '' 
muttered D'Artagnan , as he helped the attendants to carry back to her carriage the lonely lady whose lot henceforth in life was suffering .
