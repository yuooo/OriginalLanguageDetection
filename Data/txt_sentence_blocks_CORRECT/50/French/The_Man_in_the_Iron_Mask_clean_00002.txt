`` Nothing . '' 
`` Not even your liberty ? '' 
`` What do you call liberty , monsieur ? '' 
asked the prisoner , with the tone of a man who is preparing for a struggle . 
`` I call liberty , the flowers , the air , light , the stars , the happiness of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to carry you . '' 
The young man smiled , whether in resignation or contempt , it was difficult to tell . 
`` Look , '' said he , `` I have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor 's garden ; this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath my gaze ; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their perfumes , filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it . 
Look now on these two roses ; even among roses these are beautiful , and the rose is the most beautiful of flowers . 
Why , then , do you bid me desire other flowers when I possess the loveliest of all ? '' 
Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise . 
`` If flowers constitute liberty , '' sadly resumed the captive , `` I am free , for I possess them . '' 
`` But the air ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` air is so necessary to life ! '' 
`` Well , monsieur , '' returned the prisoner ; `` draw near to the window ; it is open . 
Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages of hail and lightning , exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle breezes . 
It caresses my face . 
When mounted on the back of this armchair , with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself , I fancy I am swimming the wide expanse before me . '' 
The countenance of Aramis darkened as the young man continued : `` Light I have ! 
what is better than light ? 
I have the sun , a friend who comes to visit me every day without the permission of the governor or the jailer 's company . 
He comes in at the window , and traces in my room a square the shape of the window , which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor . 
This luminous square increases from ten o'clock till midday , and decreases from one till three slowly , as if , having hastened to my presence , it sorrowed at bidding me farewell . 
When its last ray disappears I have enjoyed its presence for five hours . 
Is not that sufficient ? 
I have been told that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries , and laborers who toil in mines , who never behold it at all . '' 
Aramis wiped the drops from his brow . 
`` As to the stars which are so delightful to view , '' continued the young man , `` they all resemble each other save in size and brilliancy . 
I am a favored mortal , for if you had not lighted that candle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was gazing at from my couch before your arrival , whose silvery rays were stealing through my brain . '' 
Aramis lowered his head ; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter flow of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive . 
`` So much , then , for the flowers , the air , the daylight , and the stars , '' tranquilly continued the young man ; `` there remains but exercise . 
Do I not walk all day in the governor 's garden if it is fine - here if it rains ? 
in the fresh air if it is warm ; in perfect warmth , thanks to my winter stove , if it be cold ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , do you fancy , '' continued the prisoner , not without bitterness , `` that men have not done everything for me that a man can hope for or desire ? '' 
`` Men ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` be it so ; but it seems to me you are forgetting Heaven . '' 
`` Indeed I have forgotten Heaven , '' murmured the prisoner , with emotion ; `` but why do you mention it ? 
Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of Heaven ? '' 
Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth , who possessed the resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist . 
`` Is not Heaven in everything ? '' 
he murmured in a reproachful tone . 
`` Say rather , at the end of everything , '' answered the prisoner , firmly . 
`` Be it so , '' said Aramis ; `` but let us return to our starting-point . '' 
`` I ask nothing better , '' returned the young man . 
`` I am your confessor . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , then , you ought , as a penitent , to tell me the truth . '' 
`` My whole desire is to tell it you . '' 
`` Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been imprisoned . 
What crime , then , have you committed ? ''
