`` Nineteen years . '' 
`` Nineteen years ! '' 
The Bishop sighed deeply . 
The man continued : `` I have still the whole of my money . 
In four days I have spent only twenty-five sous , which I earned by helping unload some wagons at Grasse . 
Since you are an abbe , I will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys . 
And one day I saw a bishop there . 
Monseigneur is what they call him . 
He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles . 
He is the cure who rules over the other cures , you understand . 
Pardon me , I say that very badly ; but it is such a far-off thing to me ! 
You understand what we are ! 
He said mass in the middle of the galleys , on an altar . 
He had a pointed thing , made of gold , on his head ; it glittered in the bright light of midday . 
We were all ranged in lines on the three sides , with cannons with lighted matches facing us . 
We could not see very well . 
He spoke ; but he was too far off , and we did not hear . 
That is what a bishop is like . '' 
While he was speaking , the Bishop had gone and shut the door , which had remained wide open . 
Madame Magloire returned . 
She brought a silver fork and spoon , which she placed on the table . 
`` Madame Magloire , '' said the Bishop , `` place those things as near the fire as possible . '' 
And turning to his guest : `` The night wind is harsh on the Alps . 
You must be cold , sir . '' 
Each time that he uttered the word sir , in his voice which was so gently grave and polished , the man 's face lighted up . 
Monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa . 
Ignominy thirsts for consideration . 
`` This lamp gives a very bad light , '' said the Bishop . 
Madame Magloire understood him , and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur 's bed-chamber , and placed them , lighted , on the table . 
`` Monsieur le Cure , '' said the man , `` you are good ; you do not despise me . 
You receive me into your house . 
You light your candles for me . 
Yet I have not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate man . '' 
The Bishop , who was sitting close to him , gently touched his hand . 
`` You could not help telling me who you were . 
This is not my house ; it is the house of Jesus Christ . 
This door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name , but whether he has a grief . 
You suffer , you are hungry and thirsty ; you are welcome . 
And do not thank me ; do not say that I receive you in my house . 
No one is at home here , except the man who needs a refuge . 
I say to you , who are passing by , that you are much more at home here than I am myself . 
Everything here is yours . 
What need have I to know your name ? 
Besides , before you told me you had one which I knew . '' 
The man opened his eyes in astonishment . 
`` Really ? 
You knew what I was called ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the Bishop , `` you are called my brother . '' 
`` Stop , Monsieur le Cure , '' exclaimed the man . 
`` I was very hungry when I entered here ; but you are so good , that I no longer know what has happened to me . ''
