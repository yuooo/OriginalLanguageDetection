`` Yes ; as you see . '' 
`` You have given a most charming fete to the king . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
beautiful ! '' 
`` Is the king pleased ? '' 
`` Enchanted . '' 
`` Did he desire you to say as much to me ? '' 
`` He would not choose so unworthy a messenger , monseigneur . '' 
`` You do not do yourself justice , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` Is that your bed , there ? '' 
`` Yes ; but why do you ask ? 
Are you not satisfied with your own ? '' 
`` My I speak frankly to you ? '' 
`` Most assuredly . '' 
`` Well , then , I am not . '' 
Fouquet started ; and then replied , `` Will you take my room , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` What ! 
deprive you of it , monseigneur ? 
never ! '' 
`` What am I to do , then ? '' 
`` Allow me to share yours with you . '' 
Fouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly . 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
he said , `` you have just left the king . '' 
`` I have , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room ? '' 
`` Monseigneur - '' `` Very well , Monsieur d'Artagnan , very well . 
You are the master here . '' 
`` I assure you , monseigneur , that I do not wish to abuse - '' Fouquet turned to his valet , and said , `` Leave us . '' 
When the man had left , he said to D'Artagnan , `` You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
`` A man of your superior intelligence can not have come to talk with a man like myself , at such an hour as the present , without grave motives . '' 
`` Do not interrogate me . '' 
`` On the contrary . 
What do you want with me ? '' 
`` Nothing more than the pleasure of your society . '' 
`` Come into the garden , then , '' said the superintendent suddenly , `` or into the park . '' 
`` No , '' replied the musketeer , hastily , `` no . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` The fresh air - '' `` Come , admit at once that you arrest me , '' said the superintendent to the captain . 
`` Never ! '' 
said the latter . 
`` You intend to look after me , then ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , I do , upon my honor . '' 
`` Upon your honor - ah ! 
that is quite another thing ! 
So I am to be arrested in my own house . '' 
`` Do not say such a thing . ''
