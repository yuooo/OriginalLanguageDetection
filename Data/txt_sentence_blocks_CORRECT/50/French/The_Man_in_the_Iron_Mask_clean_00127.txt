Let us try to amuse ourselves . '' 
`` As you please , D'Artagnan ; not for the sake of amusing ourselves , but to gain an opportunity for talking freely . '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign to a soldier , who brought the gentlemen some guns , and then returned to the fort . 
`` And now , '' said the musketeer , `` answer me the question put to you by that black-looking Saint-Mars : what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles ? '' 
`` To bid you farewell . '' 
`` Bid me farewell ! 
What do you mean by that ? 
Is Raoul going anywhere ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` With M. de Beaufort it is , my dear friend . 
You always guess correctly . '' 
`` From habit . '' 
Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation , Raoul , with his head hanging down and his heart oppressed , seated himself on a mossy rock , his gun across his knees , looking at the sea - looking at the heavens , and listening to the voice of his soul ; he allowed the sportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him . 
D'Artagnan remarked his absence . 
`` He has not recovered the blow ? '' 
said he to Athos . 
`` He is struck to death . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your fears exaggerate , I hope . 
Raoul is of a tempered nature . 
Around all hearts as noble as his , there is a second envelope that forms a cuirass . 
The first bleeds , the second resists . '' 
`` No , '' replied Athos , `` Raoul will die of it . '' 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , in a melancholy tone . 
And he did not add a word to this exclamation . 
Then , a minute after , `` Why do you let him go ? '' 
`` Because he insists on going . '' 
`` And why do you not go with him ? '' 
`` Because I could not bear to see him die . '' 
D'Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face . 
`` You know one thing , '' continued the comte , leaning upon the arm of the captain ; `` you know that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things . 
Well ! 
I have an incessant gnawing , insurmountable fear that an hour will come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan ; `` oh ! '' 
`` He will die , I know , I have a perfect conviction of that ; but I would not see him die . '' 
`` How is this , Athos ? 
you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man , you say you have ever seen , of your own D'Artagnan , of that man without an equal , as you formerly called him , and you come and tell him , with your arms folded , that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son , you who have seen all that can be seen in this world ! 
Why have you this fear , Athos ? 
Man upon this earth must expect everything , and ought to face everything . '' 
`` Listen to me , my friend . 
After having worn myself out upon this earth of which you speak , I have preserved but two religions : that of life , friendship , my duty as a father - that of eternity , love , and respect for God . 
Now , I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence -- oh ! 
no , I can not even tell you , D'Artagnan ! '' 
`` Speak , speak , tell me ! '' 
`` I am strong against everything , except against the death of those I love . 
For that only there is no remedy . 
He who dies , gains ; he who sees others die , loses .
