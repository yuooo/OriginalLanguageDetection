Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins . 
The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity ; the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion . 
But in a few days Fantine disarmed them . 
She said all kinds of humble and gentle things , and the mother in her provoked tenderness . 
One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever : `` I have been a sinner ; but when I have my child beside me , it will be a sign that God has pardoned me . 
While I was leading a bad life , I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me ; I could not have borne her sad , astonished eyes . 
It was for her sake that I did evil , and that is why God pardons me . 
I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here . 
I shall gaze at her ; it will do me good to see that innocent creature . 
She knows nothing at all . 
She is an angel , you see , my sisters . 
At that age the wings have not fallen off . '' 
M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day , and each time she asked him : -- `` Shall I see my Cosette soon ? '' 
He answered : -- `` To-morrow , perhaps . 
She may arrive at any moment . 
I am expecting her . '' 
And the mother 's pale face grew radiant . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she said , `` how happy I am going to be ! '' 
We have just said that she did not recover her health . 
On the contrary , her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week . 
That handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration , as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last . 
At that time people were beginning to follow the fine Laennec 's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies . 
The doctor sounded Fantine 's chest and shook his head . 
M. Madeleine said to the doctor : -- `` Well ? '' 
`` Has she not a child which she desires to see ? '' 
said the doctor . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
Make haste and get it here ! '' 
M. Madeleine shuddered . 
Fantine inquired : -- `` What did the doctor say ? '' 
M. Madeleine forced himself to smile . 
`` He said that your child was to be brought speedily . 
That that would restore your health . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
she rejoined , `` he is right ! 
But what do those Thenardiers mean by keeping my Cosette from me ! 
Oh ! 
she is coming . 
At last I behold happiness close beside me ! '' 
In the meantime Thenardier did not `` let go of the child , '' and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it . 
Cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter . 
And then , there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood , and they were collecting the bills for them , etc. , etc. `` I shall send some one to fetch Cosette ! '' 
said Father Madeleine . 
`` If necessary , I will go myself . '' 
He wrote the following letter to Fantine 's dictation , and made her sign it : -- `` MONSIEUR THENARDIER : -- You will deliver Cosette to this person . 
You will be paid for all the little things . 
I have the honor to salute you with respect . 
`` FANTINE . ''
