Taken or killed ! 
Ah ! 
Ah ! 
sire ! 
tell me , if the news is true , how much has it cost you in men and money . 
We will then reckon if the game has been worth the stakes . '' 
As he spoke thus , the king went up to him in great anger , and said , `` Monsieur d'Artagnan , your replies are those of a rebel ! 
Tell me , if you please , who is king of France ? 
Do you know any other ? '' 
`` Sire , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , coldly , `` I very well remember that one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many people who did not answer to it , whilst I , on my part , did answer to it . 
If I recognized my king on that day , when the thing was not easy , I think it would be useless to ask the question of me now , when your majesty and I are alone . '' 
At these words Louis cast down his eyes . 
It appeared to him that the shade of the unfortunate Philippe passed between D'Artagnan and himself , to evoke the remembrance of that terrible adventure . 
Almost at the same moment an officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the king , who , in his turn , changed color , while reading it . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` what I learn here you would know later ; it is better I should tell you , and that you should learn it from the mouth of your king . 
A battle has taken place at Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a calm air , though his heart was beating fast enough to choke him . 
`` Well , sire ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur - and I have lost a hundred and ten men . '' 
A beam of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D'Artagnan . 
`` And the rebels ? '' 
said he . 
`` The rebels have fled , '' said the king . 
D'Artagnan could not restrain a cry of triumph . 
`` Only , '' added the king , `` I have a fleet which closely blockades Belle-Isle , and I am certain not a bark can escape . '' 
`` So that , '' said the musketeer , brought back to his dismal idea , `` if these two gentlemen are taken - '' `` They will be hanged , '' said the king , quietly . 
`` And do they know it ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan , repressing his trembling . 
`` They know it , because you must have told them yourself ; and all the country knows it . '' 
`` Then , sire , they will never be taken alive , I will answer for that . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the king , negligently , and taking up his letter again . 
`` Very well , they will be dead , then , Monsieur d'Artagnan , and that will come to the same thing , since I should only take them to have them hanged . '' 
D'Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow . 
`` I have told you , '' pursued Louis XIV. , `` that I would one day be an affectionate , generous , and constant master . 
You are now the only man of former times worthy of my anger or my friendship . 
I will not spare you either sentiment , according to your conduct . 
Could you serve a king , Monsieur d'Artagnan , who should have a hundred kings , his equals , in the kingdom ? 
Could I , tell me , do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate ? 
Did you ever see an artist effect great works with an unworthy tool ? 
Far from us , monsieur , the old leaven of feudal abuse ! 
The Fronde , which threatened to ruin monarchy , has emancipated it . 
I am master at home , Captain d'Artagnan , and I shall have servants who , lacking , perhaps , your genius , will carry devotion and obedience to the verge of heroism . 
Of what consequence , I ask you , of what consequence is it that God has given no sense to arms and legs ? 
It is to the head he has given genius , and the head , you know , the rest obey . 
I am the head . '' 
D'Artagnan started . 
Louis XIV . 
continued as if he had seen nothing , although this emotion had not by any means escaped him .
