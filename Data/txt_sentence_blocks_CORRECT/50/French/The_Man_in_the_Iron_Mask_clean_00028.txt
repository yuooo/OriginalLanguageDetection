Moliere , on the other hand , quite delighted at having made such a capital rough sketch , and at knowing where to find his original again , whenever he should desire to convert his sketch into a picture , Moliere arrived in the merriest of moods . 
All the first story of the left wing was occupied by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris , and those on the freest footing in the house - every one in his compartment , like the bees in their cells , employed in producing the honey intended for that royal cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV . 
during the fete at Vaux . 
Pelisson , his head leaning on his hand , was engaged in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the `` Facheux , '' a comedy in three acts , which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere , as D'Artagnan called him , or Coquelin de Voliere , as Porthos styled him . 
Loret , with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer , - the gazetteers of all ages have always been so artless ! 
- Loret was composing an account of the fetes at Vaux , before those fetes had taken place . 
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other , a peripatetic , absent - minded , boring , unbearable dreamer , who kept buzzing and humming at everybody 's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions . 
He so often disturbed Pelisson , that the latter , raising his head , crossly said , `` At least , La Fontaine , supply me with a rhyme , since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus . '' 
`` What rhyme do you want ? '' 
asked the Fabler as Madame de Sevigne used to call him . 
`` I want a rhyme to lumiere . '' 
`` Orniere , '' answered La Fontaine . 
`` Ah , but , my good friend , one can not talk of wheel-ruts when celebrating the delights of Vaux , '' said Loret . 
`` Besides , it does n't rhyme , '' answered Pelisson . 
`` What ! 
does n't rhyme ! '' 
cried La Fontaine , in surprise . 
`` Yes ; you have an abominable habit , my friend , - a habit which will ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order . 
You rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , oh , you think so , do you , Pelisson ? '' 
`` Yes , I do , indeed . 
Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can find a better . '' 
`` Then I will never write anything again save in prose , '' said La Fontaine , who had taken up Pelisson 's reproach in earnest . 
`` Ah ! 
I often suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet ! 
Yes , 't is the very truth . '' 
`` Do not say so ; your remark is too sweeping , and there is much that is good in your ` Fables . ' '' 
`` And to begin , '' continued La Fontaine , following up his idea , `` I will go and burn a hundred verses I have just made . '' 
`` Where are your verses ? '' 
`` In my head . '' 
`` Well , if they are in your head you can not burn them . '' 
`` True , '' said La Fontaine ; `` but if I do not burn them - '' `` Well , what will happen if you do not burn them ? '' 
`` They will remain in my mind , and I shall never forget them ! '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
cried Loret ; `` what a dangerous thing ! 
One would go mad with it ! '' 
`` The deuce ! 
the deuce ! '' 
repeated La Fontaine ; `` what can I do ? '' 
`` I have discovered the way , '' said Moliere , who had entered just at this point of the conversation . 
`` What way ? '' 
`` Write them first and burn them afterwards . '' 
`` How simple ! 
Well , I should never have discovered that . 
What a mind that devil of a Moliere has ! '' 
said La Fontaine . 
Then , striking his forehead , `` Oh , thou wilt never be aught but an ass , Jean La Fontaine ! '' 
he added . 
`` What are you saying there , my friend ? '' 
broke in Moliere , approaching the poet , whose aside he had heard .
