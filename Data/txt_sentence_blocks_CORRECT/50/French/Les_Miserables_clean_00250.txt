MOTHER INNOCENTE About a quarter of an hour elapsed . 
The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair . 
The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied . 
We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued , to the best of our ability . 
`` Father Fauvent ! '' 
`` Reverend Mother ! '' 
`` Do you know the chapel ? '' 
`` I have a little cage there , where I hear the mass and the offices . '' 
`` And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties ? '' 
`` Two or three times . '' 
`` There is a stone to be raised . '' 
`` Heavy ? '' 
`` The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar . '' 
`` The slab which closes the vault ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` It would be a good thing to have two men for it . '' 
`` Mother Ascension , who is as strong as a man , will help you . '' 
`` A woman is never a man . '' 
`` We have only a woman here to help you . 
Each one does what he can . 
Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard , while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven , I do not despise Merlonus Horstius . '' 
`` Neither do I. '' `` Merit consists in working according to one 's strength . 
A cloister is not a dock-yard . '' 
`` And a woman is not a man . 
But my brother is the strong one , though ! '' 
`` And can you get a lever ? '' 
`` That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door . '' 
`` There is a ring in the stone . '' 
`` I will put the lever through it . '' 
`` And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot . '' 
`` That is good , reverend Mother . 
I will open the vault . '' 
`` And the four Mother Precentors will help you . '' 
`` And when the vault is open ? '' 
`` It must be closed again . '' 
`` Will that be all ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Give me your orders , very reverend Mother . '' 
`` Fauvent , we have confidence in you . '' 
`` I am here to do anything you wish . '' 
`` And to hold your peace about everything ! '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` When the vault is open -- '' `` I will close it again . '' 
`` But before that -- '' `` What , reverend Mother ? '' 
`` Something must be lowered into it . '' 
A silence ensued . 
The prioress , after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation , broke it . 
`` Father Fauvent ! '' 
`` Reverend Mother ! '' 
`` You know that a mother died this morning ? ''
