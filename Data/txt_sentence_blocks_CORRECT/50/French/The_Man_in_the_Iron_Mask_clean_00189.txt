`` Messieurs , it is serious , '' said another , `` he is going to faint ; does any one of you happen to have any salts ? '' 
And they all laughed . 
This hail of jests fell round Biscarrat 's ears like musket-balls in a melee . 
He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations . 
`` What do you suppose I have seen ? ' 
asked he . 
`` I was too hot when I entered the grotto , and I have been struck with a chill . 
That is all . '' 
`` But the dogs , the dogs ; have you seen them again - did you see anything of them - do you know anything about them ? '' 
`` I suppose they have got out some other way . '' 
`` Messieurs , '' said one of the young men , `` there is in that which is going on , in the paleness and silence of our friend , a mystery which Biscarrat will not , or can not reveal . 
Only , and this is certain , Biscarrat has seen something in the grotto . 
Well , for my part , I am very curious to see what it is , even if it is the devil ! 
To the grotto ! 
messieurs , to the grotto ! '' 
`` To the grotto ! '' 
repeated all the voices . 
And the echo of the cavern carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis , `` To the grotto ! 
to the grotto ! '' 
Biscarrat threw himself before his companions . 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! '' 
cried he , `` in the name of Heaven ! 
do not go in ! '' 
`` Why , what is there so terrific in the cavern ? '' 
asked several at once . 
`` Come , speak , Biscarrat . '' 
`` Decidedly , it is the devil he has seen , '' repeated he who had before advanced that hypothesis . 
`` Well , '' said another , `` if he has seen him , he need not be selfish ; he may as well let us have a look at him in turn . '' 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! 
I beseech you , '' urged Biscarrat . 
`` Nonsense ! 
Let us pass ! '' 
`` Messieurs , I implore you not to enter ! '' 
`` Why , you went in yourself . '' 
Then one of the officers , who - of a riper age than the others - had till this time remained behind , and had said nothing , advanced . 
`` Messieurs , '' said he , with a calmness which contrasted with the animation of the young men , `` there is in there some person , or something , that is not the devil ; but which , whatever it may be , has had sufficient power to silence our dogs . 
We must discover who this some one is , or what this something is . '' 
Biscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends , but it was useless . 
In vain he threw himself before the rashest ; in vain he clung to the rocks to bar the passage ; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave , in the steps of the officer who had spoken last , but who had sprung in first , sword in hand , to face the unknown danger . 
Biscarrat , repulsed by his friends , unable to accompany them , without passing in the eyes of Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer , with painfully attentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers . 
As to the guards , they penetrated further and further , with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced . 
All at once , a discharge of musketry , growling like thunder , exploded in the entrails of the vault . 
Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning . 
At the same instant , cries , shrieks , imprecations burst forth , and the little troop of gentlemen reappeared - some pale , some bleeding - all enveloped in a cloud of smoke , which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the fugitives , `` you knew there was an ambuscade in that cavern , and you did not warn us ! 
Biscarrat , you are the cause that four of us are murdered men !
