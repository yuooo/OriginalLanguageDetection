`` Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty 's army ! 
That is incredible . '' 
`` You have no power to judge of my will . '' 
`` But I have to judge of my own friendships , sire . '' 
`` He who serves his friends does not serve his master . '' 
`` I so well understand this , sire , that I have respectfully offered your majesty my resignation . '' 
`` And I have accepted it , monsieur , '' said the king . 
`` Before being separated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep my word . '' 
`` Your majesty has kept more than your word , for your majesty has had me arrested , '' said D'Artagnan , with his cold , bantering air ; `` you did not promise me that , sire . '' 
The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry , and continued , seriously , `` You see , monsieur , to what grave steps your disobedience forces me . '' 
`` My disobedience ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , red with anger . 
`` It is the mildest term that I can find , '' pursued the king . 
`` My idea was to take and punish rebels ; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels were your friends or not ? '' 
`` But I was , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` It was a cruelty on your majesty 's part to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets . '' 
`` It was a trial I had to make , monsieur , of pretended servants , who eat my bread and should defend my person . 
The trial has succeeded ill , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` For one bad servant your majesty loses , '' said the musketeer , with bitterness , `` there are ten who , on that same day , go through a like ordeal . 
Listen to me , sire ; I am not accustomed to that service . 
Mine is a rebel sword when I am required to do ill . 
It was ill to send me in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet , your majesty 's preserver , implored you to save . 
Still further , these men were my friends . 
They did not attack your majesty , they succumbed to your blind anger . 
Besides , why were they not allowed to escape ? 
What crime had they committed ? 
I admit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct . 
But why suspect me before the action ? 
Why surround me with spies ? 
Why disgrace me before the army ? 
Why me , in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who for thirty years have been attached to your person , and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion - for it must be said , now that I am accused - why reduce me to see three thousand of the king 's soldiers march in battle against two men ? '' 
`` One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me ! '' 
said the king , in a hollow voice , `` and that it was no merit of theirs I was not lost . '' 
`` Sire , one would imagine you forget that I was there . '' 
`` Enough , Monsieur d'Artagnan , enough of these dominating interests which arise to keep the sun itself from my interests . 
I am founding a state in which there shall be but one master , as I promised you ; the moment is at hand for me to keep my promise . 
You wish to be , according to your tastes or private friendships , free to destroy my plans and save my enemies ? 
I will thwart you or will drop you - seek a more compliant master . 
I know full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do , and would allow himself to be dominated by you , at the risk of sending you some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest ; but I have an excellent memory , and for me , services are sacred titles to gratitude , to impunity . 
You shall only have this lesson , Monsieur d'Artagnan , as the punishment of your want of discipline , and I will not imitate my predecessors in anger , not having imitated them in favor . 
And , then , other reasons make me act mildly towards you ; in the first place , because you are a man of sense , a man of excellent sense , a man of heart , and that you will be a capital servant to him who shall have mastered you ; secondly , because you will cease to have any motives for insubordination . 
Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me . 
These supports on which your capricious mind instinctively relied I have caused to disappear . 
At this moment , my soldiers have taken or killed the rebels of Belle-Isle . '' 
D'Artagnan became pale . 
`` Taken or killed ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh ! 
sire , if you thought what you tell , if you were sure you were telling me the truth , I should forget all that is just , all that is magnanimous in your words , to call you a barbarous king , and an unnatural man . 
But I pardon you these words , '' said he , smiling with pride ; `` I pardon them to a young prince who does not know , who can not comprehend what such men as M. d'Herblay , M. du Vallon , and myself are .
