my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , I should be very glad to sleep . '' 
`` Who hinders you ? '' 
`` Why , you in the first place . '' 
`` I ? 
Oh , monseigneur ! '' 
`` No doubt you do . 
Is it at Nantes as at Paris ? 
Do you not come in the king 's name ? '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , monseigneur , '' replied the captain , `` leave the king alone ! 
The day on which I shall come on the part of the king , for the purpose you mean , take my word for it , I will not leave you long in doubt . 
You will see me place my hand on my sword , according to the ordonnance , and you will hear my say at once , in ceremonial voice , ` Monseigneur , in the name of the king , I arrest you ! ' '' 
`` You promise me that frankness ? '' 
said the superintendent . 
`` Upon my honor ! 
But we have not come to that , believe me . '' 
`` What makes you think that , M. d'Artagnan ? 
For my part , I think quite the contrary . '' 
`` I have heard speak of nothing of the kind , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Indeed , no . 
You are an agreeable man , in spite of your fever . 
The king should not , can not help loving you , at the bottom of his heart . '' 
Fouquet 's expression implied doubt . 
`` But M. Colbert ? '' 
said he ; `` does M. Colbert love me as much as you say ? '' 
`` I am not speaking of M. Colbert , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He is an exceptional man . 
He does not love you ; so much is very possible ; but , mordioux ! 
the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little trouble . '' 
`` Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend ? '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` and that , upon my life ! 
I have never met with a man of your intelligence , and heart ? '' 
`` You are pleased to say so , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Why did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment ? '' 
`` Blind that we are ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Your voice is getting hoarse , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` drink , monseigneur , drink ! '' 
And he offered him a cup of tisane , with the most friendly cordiality ; Fouquet took it , and thanked him by a gentle smile . 
`` Such things only happen to me , '' said the musketeer . 
`` I have passed ten years under your very beard , while you were rolling about tons of gold . 
You were clearing an annual pension of four millions ; you never observed me ; and you find out there is such a person in the world , just at the moment you - '' `` Just at the moment I am about to fall , '' interrupted Fouquet . 
`` That is true , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` But you thought so ; and that is the same thing . 
Well ! 
if I fall , take my word as truth , I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself , as I strike my brow , ` Fool ! 
fool ! 
- stupid mortal !
