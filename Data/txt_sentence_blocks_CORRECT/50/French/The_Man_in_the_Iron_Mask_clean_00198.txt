`` Impossible ! '' 
`` Well , captain , look yourself , '' said the sailor . 
And he passed him the glass . 
`` Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this ? '' 
asked Yves . 
Aramis shrugged his shoulders . 
The skipper lifted the glass to his eye . 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , '' said he , `` it is a miracle - there they are ; it seems as if I were going to touch them . 
Twenty-five men at least ! 
Ah ! 
I see the captain forward . 
He holds a glass like this , and is looking at us . 
Ah ! 
he turns round , and gives an order ; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward - they are loading it - pointing it . 
Misericorde ! 
they are firing at us ! '' 
And by a mechanical movement , the skipper put aside the telescope , and the pursuing ship , relegated to the horizon , appeared again in its true aspect . 
The vessel was still at the distance of nearly a league , but the maneuver sighted thus was not less real . 
A light cloud of smoke appeared beneath the sails , more blue than they , and spreading like a flower opening ; then , at about a mile from the little canoe , they saw the ball take the crown off two or three waves , dig a white furrow in the sea , and disappear at the end of it , as inoffensive as the stone with which , in play , a boy makes ducks and drakes . 
It was at once a menace and a warning . 
`` What is to be done ? '' 
asked the patron . 
`` They will sink us ! '' 
said Goenne , `` give us absolution , monseigneur ! '' 
And the sailors fell on their knees before him . 
`` You forget that they can see you , '' said he . 
`` That is true ! '' 
said the sailors , ashamed of their weakness . 
`` Give us your orders , monseigneur , we are prepared to die for you . '' 
`` Let us wait , '' said Aramis . 
`` How - let us wait ? '' 
`` Yes ; do you not see , as you just now said , that if we endeavor to fly , they will sink us ? '' 
`` But , perhaps , '' the patron ventured to say , `` perhaps under cover of night , we could escape them . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Aramis , `` they have , no doubt , Greek fire with which to lighten their own course and ours likewise . '' 
At the same moment , as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of Aramis , a second cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens , and from the bosom of that cloud sparkled an arrow of flame , which described a parabola like a rainbow , and fell into the sea , where it continued to burn , illuminating a space of a quarter of a league in diameter . 
The Bretons looked at each other in terror . 
`` You see plainly , '' said Aramis , `` it will be better to wait for them . '' 
The oars dropped from the hands of the sailors , and the bark , ceasing to make way , rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves . 
Night came on , but still the ship drew nearer . 
It might be imagined it redoubled its speed with darkness . 
From time to time , as a vulture rears its head out of its nest , the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides , and cast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall . 
At last it came within musket-shot . 
All the men were on deck , arms in hand ; the cannoniers were at their guns , the matches burning . 
It might be thought they were about to board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in number to their own , not to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by four people . 
`` Surrender ! '' 
cried the commander of the balancelle , with the aid of his speaking-trumpet . 
The sailors looked at Aramis . 
Aramis made a sign with his head .
