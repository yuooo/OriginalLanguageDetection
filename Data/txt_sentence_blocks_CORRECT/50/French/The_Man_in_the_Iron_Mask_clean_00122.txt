`` A rock ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` Level with the water , but below water ; a dangerous passage , yet one I have cleared a thousand times ; the gentleman required me to land him at Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur ! '' 
cried the fisherman , with his Provencal accent , `` a man is a sailor , or he is not ; he knows his course , or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber . 
I was obstinate , and wished to try the channel . 
The gentleman took me by the collar , and told me quietly he would strangle me . 
My mate armed himself with a hatchet , and so did I . 
We had the affront of the night before to pay him out for . 
But the gentleman drew his sword , and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner , that we neither of us could get near him . 
I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head , and I had a right to do so , had n't I , monsieur ? 
for a sailor aboard is master , as a citizen is in his chamber ; I was going , then , in self-defense , to cut the gentleman in two , when , all at once - believe me or not , monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself , I do n't know how , and there came out of it a sort of a phantom , his head covered with a black helmet and a black mask , something terrible to look upon , which came towards me threatening with its fist . '' 
`` And that was - '' said Athos . 
`` That was the devil , monsieur ; for the gentleman , with great glee , cried out , on seeing him : ` Ah ! 
thank you , monseigneur ! ' '' 
`` A most strange story ! '' 
murmured the comte , looking at Raoul . 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
asked the latter of the fisherman . 
`` You must know , monsieur , that two poor men , such as we are , could be no match for two gentlemen ; but when one of them turned out to be the devil , we had no earthly chance ! 
My companion and I did not stop to consult one another ; we made but one jump into the sea , for we were within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore . '' 
`` Well , and then ? '' 
`` Why , and then , monseigneur , as there was a little wind from the southwest , the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Oh ! 
- but the travelers ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
you need not be uneasy about them ! 
It was pretty plain that one was the devil , and protected the other ; for when we recovered the boat , after she got afloat again , instead of finding these two creatures injured by the shock , we found nothing , not even the carriage or the case . '' 
`` Very strange ! 
very strange ! '' 
repeated the comte . 
`` But after that , what did you do , my friend ? '' 
`` I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite 's , who brought my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would have me flogged . '' 
`` What ! 
did the governor himself say so ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; and yet my boat was injured , seriously injured , for the prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite 's , and the carpenter asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it . '' 
`` Very well , '' replied Raoul ; `` you will be exempted from the service . 
Go . '' 
`` We will go to Sainte-Marguerite 's , shall we ? '' 
said the comte to Bragelonne , as the man walked away . 
`` Yes , monsieur , for there is something to be cleared up ; that man does not seem to me to have told the truth . '' 
`` Nor to me either , Raoul . 
The story of the masked man and the carriage having disappeared , may be told to conceal some violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea , to punish him for his persistence in embarking . '' 
`` I formed the same suspicion ; the carriage was more likely to contain property than a man . '' 
`` We shall see to that , Raoul . 
The gentleman very much resembles D'Artagnan ; I recognize his methods of proceeding . 
Alas ! 
we are no longer the young invincibles of former days . 
Who knows whether the hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which the best blades of Europe , balls , and bullets have not been able to do in forty years ? ''
