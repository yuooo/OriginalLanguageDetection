The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse , torn trousers of coarse velvet , bare feet , and something which resembled a pool of blood . 
Marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him : -- `` You do not recognize me ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Eponine . '' 
Marius bent hastily down . 
It was , in fact , that unhappy child . 
She was dressed in men 's clothes . 
`` How come you here ? 
What are you doing here ? '' 
`` I am dying , '' said she . 
There are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings . 
Marius cried out with a start : -- `` You are wounded ! 
Wait , I will carry you into the room ! 
They will attend to you there . 
Is it serious ? 
How must I take hold of you in order not to hurt you ? 
Where do you suffer ? 
Help ! 
My God ! 
But why did you come hither ? '' 
And he tried to pass his arm under her , in order to raise her . 
She uttered a feeble cry . 
`` Have I hurt you ? '' 
asked Marius . 
`` A little . '' 
`` But I only touched your hand . '' 
She raised her hand to Marius , and in the middle of that hand Marius saw a black hole . 
`` What is the matter with your hand ? '' 
said he . 
`` It is pierced . '' 
`` Pierced ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What with ? '' 
`` A bullet . '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Did you see a gun aimed at you ? '' 
`` Yes , and a hand stopping it . '' 
`` It was mine . '' 
Marius was seized with a shudder . 
`` What madness ! 
Poor child ! 
But so much the better , if that is all , it is nothing , let me carry you to a bed . 
They will dress your wound ; one does not die of a pierced hand . '' 
She murmured : -- `` The bullet traversed my hand , but it came out through my back . 
It is useless to remove me from this spot . 
I will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon . 
Sit down near me on this stone . '' 
He obeyed ; she laid her head on Marius ' knees , and , without looking at him , she said : -- `` Oh ! 
How good this is ! 
How comfortable this is !
