You will keep watch ; there is a hole in the wall , as you have informed me . 
These men will come . 
Leave them to their own devices for a time . 
When you think matters have reached a crisis , and that it is time to put a stop to them , fire a shot . 
Not too soon . 
The rest concerns me . 
A shot into the ceiling , the air , no matter where . 
Above all things , not too soon . 
Wait until they begin to put their project into execution ; you are a lawyer ; you know the proper point . '' 
Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat . 
`` That makes a lump that can be seen , '' said the inspector . 
`` Put them in your trousers pocket . '' 
Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets . 
`` Now , '' pursued the inspector , `` there is not a minute more to be lost by any one . 
What time is it ? 
Half-past two . 
Seven o'clock is the hour ? '' 
`` Six o'clock , '' answered Marius . 
`` I have plenty of time , '' said the inspector , `` but no more than enough . 
Do n't forget anything that I have said to you . 
Bang . 
A pistol shot . '' 
`` Rest easy , '' said Marius . 
And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out , the inspector called to him : -- `` By the way , if you have occasion for my services between now and then , come or send here . 
You will ask for Inspector Javert . '' 
JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES A few moments later , about three o'clock , Courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet . 
The snow had redoubled in violence , and filled the air . 
Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac : -- `` One would say , to see all these snow-flakes fall , that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven . '' 
All at once , Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air . 
`` Hold ! '' 
said Bossuet . 
`` There 's Marius . '' 
`` I saw him , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` Do n't let 's speak to him . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` He is busy . '' 
`` With what ? '' 
`` Do n't you see his air ? '' 
`` What air ? '' 
`` He has the air of a man who is following some one . '' 
`` That 's true , '' said Bossuet . 
`` Just see the eyes he is making ! '' 
said Courfeyrac . 
`` But who the deuce is he following ? '' 
`` Some fine , flowery bonneted wench ! 
He 's in love . '' 
`` But , '' observed Bossuet , `` I do n't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street . 
There 's not a woman round . '' 
Courfeyrac took a survey , and exclaimed : -- `` He 's following a man ! '' 
A man , in fact , wearing a gray cap , and whose gray beard could be distinguished , although they only saw his back , was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius .
