I was a countryman formerly . '' 
And Planchet marked this confession with a rather pretentious laugh for a man making profession of humility . 
Athos made a gesture of approval , and then added : `` You are going to buy an estate , then ? '' 
`` I have bought one , monsieur . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is still better . '' 
`` A little house at Fontainebleau , with something like twenty acres of land round it . '' 
`` Very well , Planchet ! 
Accept my compliments on your acquisition . '' 
`` But , monsieur , we are not comfortable here ; the cursed dust makes you cough . 
Corbleu ! 
I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman in the kingdom . '' 
Athos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed at him , in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness . 
`` Yes , '' said Athos , `` let us have a little talk by ourselves - in your own room , for example . 
You have a room , have you not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur le comte . '' 
`` Upstairs , perhaps ? '' 
And Athos , seeing Planchet a little embarrassed , wished to relieve him by going first . 
`` It is - but - '' said Planchet , hesitating . 
Athos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation , and , attributing it to a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality , `` Never mind , never mind , '' said he , still going up , `` the dwelling of a tradesman in this quarter is not expected to be a palace . 
Come on . '' 
Raoul nimbly preceded him , and entered first . 
Two cries were heard simultaneously - we may say three . 
One of these cries dominated the others ; it emanated from a woman . 
Another proceeded from the mouth of Raoul ; it was an exclamation of surprise . 
He had no sooner uttered it than he shut the door sharply . 
The third was from fright ; it came from Planchet . 
`` I ask your pardon ! '' 
added he ; `` madame is dressing . '' 
Raoul had , no doubt , seen that what Planchet said was true , for he turned round to go downstairs again . 
`` Madame - '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
pardon me , Planchet , I did not know that you had upstairs - '' `` It is Truchen , '' added Planchet , blushing a little . 
`` It is whoever you please , my good Planchet ; but pardon my rudeness . '' 
`` No , no ; go up now , gentlemen . '' 
`` We will do no such thing , '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
madame , having notice , has had time - '' `` No , Planchet ; farewell ! '' 
`` Eh , gentlemen ! 
you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the staircase , or by going away without having sat down . '' 
`` If we had known you had a lady upstairs , '' replied Athos , with his customary coolness , `` we would have asked permission to pay our respects to her . '' 
Planchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance , that he forced the passage , and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son . 
Truchen was quite dressed : in the costume of the shopkeeper 's wife , rich yet coquettish ; German eyes attacking French eyes . 
She left the apartment after two courtesies , and went down into the shop - but not without having listened at the door , to know what Planchet 's gentlemen visitors would say of her . 
Athos suspected that , and therefore turned the conversation accordingly . 
Planchet , on his part , was burning to give explanations , which Athos avoided . 
But , as certain tenacities are stronger than others , Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity , translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus . 
So Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing age , and brought good luck to his business , as Ruth did to Boaz . 
`` You want nothing now , then , but heirs to your property . '' 
`` If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres , '' said Planchet .
