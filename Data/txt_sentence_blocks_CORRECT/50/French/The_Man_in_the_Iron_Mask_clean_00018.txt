It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown , instead of running after customers , made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones . 
And so Percerin declined to fit bourgeois , or those who had but recently obtained patents of nobility . 
A story used to circulate that even M. de Mazarin , in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal , one fine day slipped letters of nobility into his pocket . 
It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D'Artagnan took the despairing Porthos ; who , as they were going along , said to his friend , `` Take care , my good D'Artagnan , not to compromise the dignity of a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin , who will , I expect , be very impertinent ; for I give you notice , my friend , that if he is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him . '' 
`` Presented by me , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` you have nothing to fear , even though you were what you are not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
't is because - '' `` What ? 
Have you anything against Percerin , Porthos ? '' 
`` I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` The fellow refused to supply me . '' 
`` Oh , a misunderstanding , no doubt , which it will be now exceedingly easy to set right . 
Mouston must have made a mistake . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
`` He has confused the names . '' 
`` Possibly . 
That rascal Mouston never can remember names . '' 
`` I will take it all upon myself . '' 
`` Very good . '' 
`` Stop the carriage , Porthos ; here we are . '' 
`` Here ! 
how here ? 
We are at the Halles ; and you told me the house was at the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . '' '' 
'T is true , but look . '' 
`` Well , I do look , and I see - '' `` What ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
that we are at the Halles ! '' 
`` You do not , I suppose , want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of it . 
Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or forty others which have arrived before us . '' 
`` No , you are right , indeed . 
What a number of people ! 
And what are they all about ? '' '' 
'T is very simple . 
They are waiting their turn . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their quarters ? '' 
`` No ; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin 's house . '' 
`` And we are going to wait too ? '' 
`` Oh , we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud . '' 
`` What are we to do , then ? '' 
`` Get down , pass through the footmen and lackeys , and enter the tailor 's house , which I will answer for our doing , if you go first . '' 
`` Come along , then , '' said Porthos . 
They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the establishment . 
The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin 's doors were closed , while a servant , standing before them , was explaining to the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M. Percerin could not receive anybody . 
It was bruited about outside still , on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom he favored , in confidence , that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes for the king , and that , owing to the urgency of the case , he was meditating in his office on the ornaments , colors , and cut of these five suits . 
Some , contented with this reason , went away again , contented to repeat the tale to others , but others , more tenacious , insisted on having the doors opened , and among these last three Blue Ribbons , intended to take parts in a ballet , which would inevitably fail unless the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great Percerin himself . 
D'Artagnan , pushing on Porthos , who scattered the groups of people right and left , succeeded in gaining the counter , behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer queries . 
-LRB- We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos like the rest , but D'Artagnan , showing himself , pronounced merely these words , `` The king 's order , '' and was let in with his friend . -RRB-
