An idea , a flash , crossed Marius ' mind ; this was the expedient of which he was in search , the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him , of sparing the assassin and saving the victim . 
He knelt down on his commode , stretched out his arm , seized the sheet of paper , softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall , wrapped the paper round it , and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den . 
It was high time . 
Thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples , and was advancing on the prisoner . 
`` Something is falling ! '' 
cried the Thenardier woman . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked her husband . 
The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster . 
She handed it to her husband . 
`` Where did this come from ? '' 
demanded Thenardier . 
`` Pardie ! '' 
ejaculated his wife , `` where do you suppose it came from ? 
Through the window , of course . '' 
`` I saw it pass , '' said Bigrenaille . 
Thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle . 
`` It 's in Eponine 's handwriting . 
The devil ! '' 
He made a sign to his wife , who hastily drew near , and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper , then he added in a subdued voice : -- `` Quick ! 
The ladder ! 
Let 's leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp ! '' 
`` Without cutting that man 's throat ? '' 
asked , the Thenardier woman . 
`` We have n't the time . '' 
`` Through what ? '' 
resumed Bigrenaille . 
`` Through the window , '' replied Thenardier . 
`` Since Ponine has thrown the stone through the window , it indicates that the house is not watched on that side . '' 
The mask with the ventriloquist 's voice deposited his huge key on the floor , raised both arms in the air , and opened and clenched his fists , three times rapidly without uttering a word . 
This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship . 
The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him ; in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window , and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks . 
The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him . 
He seemed to be dreaming or praying . 
As soon as the ladder was arranged , Thenardier cried : `` Come ! 
the bourgeoise first ! '' 
And he rushed headlong to the window . 
But just as he was about to throw his leg over , Bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar . 
`` Not much , come now , you old dog , after us ! '' 
`` After us ! '' 
yelled the ruffians . 
`` You are children , '' said Thenardier , `` we are losing time . 
The police are on our heels . '' 
`` Well , said the ruffians , `` let 's draw lots to see who shall go down first . '' 
Thenardier exclaimed : -- `` Are you mad ! 
Are you crazy ! 
What a pack of boobies ! 
You want to waste time , do you ? 
Draw lots , do you ? 
By a wet finger , by a short straw !
