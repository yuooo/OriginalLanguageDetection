Fix ceased to breathe at all . 
`` How ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` By going to Nagasaki , at the extreme south of Japan , or even to Shanghai , which is only eight hundred miles from here . 
In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast , which would be a great advantage , as the currents run northward , and would aid us . 
`` Pilot , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` I must take the American steamer at Yokohama , and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
returned the pilot . 
`` The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama . 
It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki , but it starts from Shanghai . '' 
`` You are sure of that ? '' 
`` Perfectly . '' 
`` And when does the boat leave Shanghai ? '' 
`` On the 11th , at seven in the evening . 
We have , therefore , four days before us , that is ninety-six hours ; and in that time , if we had good luck and a south-west wind , and the sea was calm , we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai . '' 
`` And you could go -- '' `` In an hour ; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up . '' 
`` It is a bargain . 
Are you the master of the boat ? '' 
`` Yes ; John Bunsby , master of the Tankadere . '' 
`` Would you like some earnest-money ? '' 
`` If it would not put your honour out -- '' `` Here are two hundred pounds on account sir , '' added Phileas Fogg , turning to Fix , `` if you would like to take advantage -- '' `` Thanks , sir ; I was about to ask the favour . '' 
`` Very well . 
In half an hour we shall go on board . '' 
`` But poor Passepartout ? '' 
urged Aouda , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance . 
`` I shall do all I can to find him , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
While Fix , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong . 
Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout 's description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him . 
The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf . 
It was now three o'clock ; and pilot-boat No. 43 , with its crew on board , and its provisions stored away , was ready for departure . 
The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons , as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht . 
Her shining copper sheathing , her galvanised iron-work , her deck , white as ivory , betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable . 
Her two masts leaned a trifle backward ; she carried brigantine , foresail , storm-jib , and standing-jib , and was well rigged for running before the wind ; and she seemed capable of brisk speed , which , indeed , she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races . 
The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the Chinese seas . 
John Bunsby , himself , a man of forty-five or thereabouts , vigorous , sunburnt , with a sprightly expression of the eye , and energetic and self-reliant countenance , would have inspired confidence in the most timid . 
Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board , where they found Fix already installed . 
Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan ; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp . 
The accommodation was confined , but neat . 
`` I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , '' said Mr. Fogg to Fix , who bowed without responding . 
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's certain , '' thought he , `` though rascal as he is , he is a polite one ! '' 
The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying Passepartout . 
Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . 
But the Frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium . 
John Bunsby , master , at length gave the order to start , and the Tankadere , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves . 
IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE `` TANKADERE '' RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year . 
The Chinese seas are usually boisterous , subject to terrible gales of wind , and especially during the equinoxes ; and it was now early November . 
It would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai . 
But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong .
