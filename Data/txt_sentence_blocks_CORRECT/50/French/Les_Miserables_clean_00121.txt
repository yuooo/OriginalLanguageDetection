The wheel really had suffered serious damage . 
The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub , so that the nut no longer held firm . 
`` My friend , '' he said to the stableman , `` is there a wheelwright here ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Do me the service to go and fetch him . '' 
`` He is only a step from here . 
Hey ! 
Master Bourgaillard ! '' 
Master Bourgaillard , the wheelwright , was standing on his own threshold . 
He came , examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken . 
`` Can you repair this wheel immediately ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` When can I set out again ? '' 
`` To-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow ! '' 
`` There is a long day 's work on it . 
Are you in a hurry , sir ? '' 
`` In a very great hurry . 
I must set out again in an hour at the latest . '' 
`` Impossible , sir . '' 
`` I will pay whatever you ask . '' 
`` Impossible . '' 
`` Well , in two hours , then . '' 
`` Impossible to-day . 
Two new spokes and a hub must be made . 
Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning . '' 
`` The matter can not wait until to-morrow . 
What if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it ? '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` You are a wheelwright ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Have you not a wheel that you can sell me ? 
Then I could start again at once . '' 
`` A spare wheel ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet . 
Two wheels make a pair . 
Two wheels can not be put together hap-hazard . '' 
`` In that case , sell me a pair of wheels . '' 
`` Not all wheels fit all axles , sir . '' 
`` Try , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is useless , sir . 
I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels . 
We are but a poor country here . '' 
`` Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have ? '' 
The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle . 
He shrugged his shoulders . 
`` You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well ! 
If I had one , I would not let it to you ! '' 
`` Well , sell it to me , then . ''
