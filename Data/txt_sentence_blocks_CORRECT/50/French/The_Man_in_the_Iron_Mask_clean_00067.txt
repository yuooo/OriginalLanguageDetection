`` What about ? '' 
inquired the governor . 
`` About the order of release , my dear friend . '' 
`` Tell me what you mean , monsieur - no , monseigneur , '' said the governor , almost suffocated by surprise and terror . 
`` It is a very simple affair : you remember , dear M. de Baisemeaux , that an order of release was sent to you . '' 
`` Yes , for Marchiali . '' 
`` Very good ! 
we both thought that it was for Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you will recollect , however , that I would not credit it , but that you compelled me to believe it . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Baisemeaux , my good fellow , what a word to make use of ! 
- strongly recommended , that was all . '' 
`` Strongly recommended , yes ; strongly recommended to give him up to you ; and that you carried him off with you in your carriage . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , it was a mistake ; it was discovered at the ministry , so that I now bring you an order from the king to set at liberty Seldon , - that poor Seldon fellow , you know . '' 
`` Seldon ! 
are you sure this time ? '' 
`` Well , read it yourself , '' added Aramis , handing him the order . 
`` Why , '' said Baisemeaux , `` this order is the very same that has already passed through my hands . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening . 
Parbleu ! 
I recognize it by the blot of ink . '' 
`` I do not know whether it is that ; but all I know is , that I bring it for you . '' 
`` But then , what about the other ? '' 
`` What other ? '' 
`` Marchiali . '' 
`` I have got him here with me . '' 
`` But that is not enough for me . 
I require a new order to take him back again . '' 
`` Do n't talk such nonsense , my dear Baisemeaux ; you talk like a child ! 
Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali ? '' 
Baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out . 
Aramis seized hold of it , coolly tore it in four pieces , held them to the lamp , and burnt them . 
`` Good heavens ! 
what are you doing ? '' 
exclaimed Baisemeaux , in an extremity of terror . 
`` Look at your position quietly , my good governor , '' said Aramis , with imperturbable self-possession , `` and you will see how very simple the whole affair is . 
You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali 's release . '' 
`` I am a lost man ! '' 
`` Far from it , my good fellow , since I have brought Marchiali back to you , and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , completely overcome by terror . 
`` Plain enough , you see ; and you will go and shut him up immediately . '' 
`` I should think so , indeed . '' 
`` And you will hand over this Seldon to me , whose liberation is authorized by this order . 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` I - I - '' `` You do understand , I see , '' said Aramis . 
`` Very good . '' 
Baisemeaux clapped his hands together . 
`` But why , at all events , after having taken Marchiali away from me , do you bring him back again ? ''
