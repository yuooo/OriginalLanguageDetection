-LRB- 10 -RRB- `` So far , well . '' 
`` And now you say that I do wrong in having in your household the Chevalier de Lorraine , who gives Monsieur ill advice respecting you ? '' 
`` Remember well what I tell you , sire ; the Chevalier de Lorraine some day - Observe , if ever I come to a dreadful end , I beforehand accuse the Chevalier de Lorraine ; he has a spirit that is capable of any crime ! '' 
`` The Chevalier de Lorraine shall no longer annoy you - I promise you that . '' 
-LRB- 11 -RRB- `` Then that will be a true preliminary of alliance , sire , - I sign ; but since you have done your part , tell me what shall be mine . '' 
`` Instead of embroiling me with your brother Charles , you must make him a more intimate friend than ever . '' 
`` That is very easy . '' 
`` Oh ! 
not quite so easy as you may suppose , for in ordinary friendship people embrace or exercise hospitality , and that only costs a kiss or a return , profitable expenses ; but in political friendship - '' `` Ah ! 
it 's a political friendship , is it ? '' 
`` Yes , my sister ; and then , instead of embraces and feasts , it is soldiers - it is soldiers all alive and well equipped - that we must serve up to our friends ; vessels we must offer , all armed with cannons and stored with provisions . 
It hence results that we have not always coffers in a fit condition for such friendships . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are quite right , '' said Madame ; `` the coffers of the king of England have been sonorous for some time . '' 
`` But you , my sister , who have so much influence over your brother , you can secure more than an ambassador could ever get the promise of . '' 
`` To effect that I must go to London , my dear brother . '' 
`` I have thought so , '' replied the king , eagerly ; `` and I have said to myself that such a voyage would do your health and spirits good . '' 
`` Only , '' interrupted Madame , `` it is possible I should fail . 
The king of England has dangerous counselors . '' 
`` Counselors , do you say ? '' 
`` Precisely . 
If , by chance , your majesty had any intention - I am only supposing so - of asking Charles II . 
his alliance in a war - '' `` A war ? '' 
`` Yes ; well ! 
then the king 's counselors , who are in number seven - Mademoiselle Stewart , Mademoiselle Wells , Mademoiselle Gwyn , Miss Orchay , Mademoiselle Zunga , Miss Davies , and the proud Countess of Castlemaine - will represent to the king that war costs a great deal of money ; that it is better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court than to equip ships of the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich . '' 
`` And then your negotiations will fail ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
those ladies cause all negotiations to fall through which they do n't make themselves . '' 
`` Do you know the idea that has struck me , sister ? '' 
`` No ; inform me what it is . '' 
`` It is that , searching well around you , you might perhaps find a female counselor to take with you to your brother , whose eloquence might paralyze the ill-will of the seven others . '' 
`` That is really an idea , sire , and I will search . '' 
`` You will find what you want . '' 
`` I hope so . '' 
`` A pretty ambassadress is necessary ; an agreeable face is better than an ugly one , is it not ? '' 
`` Most assuredly . '' 
`` An animated , lively , audacious character . '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Nobility ; that is , enough to enable her to approach the king without awkwardness - not too lofty , so as not to trouble herself about the dignity of her race . '' 
`` Very true . '' 
`` And who knows a little English . '' 
`` Mon Dieu ! 
why , some one , '' cried Madame , `` like Mademoiselle de Keroualle , for instance ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
why , yes ! '' 
said Louis XIV. ; `` you have hit the mark , - it is you who have found , my sister . '' 
`` I will take her ; she will have no cause to complain , I suppose . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , I will name her seductrice plenipotentiaire at once , and will add a dowry to the title . '' 
`` That is well . ''
