Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity - a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience . 
`` What in the world , now , is the meaning of this imbroglio ? '' 
the musketeer kept saying to himself . 
`` That will never do , '' said Aramis : `` M. Lebrun , close your box , and roll up your canvas . '' 
`` But , monsieur , '' cried the vexed painter , `` the light is abominable here . '' 
`` An idea , M. Lebrun , an idea ! 
If we had a pattern of the materials , for example , and with time , and a better light - '' `` Oh , then , '' cried Lebrun , `` I would answer for the effect . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing ; they want a pattern of each of the materials . 
Mordioux ! 
Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . '' 
Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes , Percerin put back the dresses into the closet , Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were secure , - and they all left the study . 
: Where , Probably , Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme . 
D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber ; but no longer an irritated Porthos , or a disappointed Porthos , but Porthos radiant , blooming , fascinating , and chattering with Moliere , who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry , and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater , but not even ever anything so great . 
Aramis went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand , which lost itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend , - an operation which Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness . 
But the friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him , the bishop of Vannes passed over to Moliere . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said he , `` will you come with me to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` I will go anywhere you like , monseigneur , '' answered Moliere . 
`` To Saint-Mande ! '' 
cried Porthos , surprised at seeing the proud bishop of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor . 
`` What , Aramis , are you going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically .
