He had stiffened himself in that coffin , and had become a little like a corpse . 
The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks . 
He had , in a manner , to thaw out , from the tomb . 
`` You are benumbed , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` It is a pity that I have a game leg , for otherwise we might step out briskly . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
replied Jean Valjean , `` four paces will put life into my legs once more . '' 
They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed . 
On arriving before the closed gate and the porter 's pavilion Fauchelevent , who held the grave-digger 's card in his hand , dropped it into the box , the porter pulled the rope , the gate opened , and they went out . 
`` How well everything is going ! '' 
said Fauchelevent ; `` what a capital idea that was of yours , Father Madeleine ! '' 
They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world . 
In the neighborhood of the cemetery , a shovel and pick are equal to two passports . 
The Rue Vaugirard was deserted . 
`` Father Madeleine , '' said Fauchelevent as they went along , and raising his eyes to the houses , `` Your eyes are better than mine . 
Show me No. 87 . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` There is no one in the street , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` Give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me . '' 
Fauchelevent entered No. 87 , ascended to the very top , guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret , and knocked in the dark , at the door of an attic . 
A voice replied : `` Come in . '' 
It was Gribier 's voice . 
Fauchelevent opened the door . 
The grave-digger 's dwelling was , like all such wretched habitations , an unfurnished and encumbered garret . 
A packing-case -- a coffin , perhaps -- took the place of a commode , a butter-pot served for a drinking-fountain , a straw mattress served for a bed , the floor served instead of tables and chairs . 
In a corner , on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet , a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap . 
The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned . 
One would have said that there had been an earthquake `` for one . '' 
The covers were displaced , the rags scattered about , the jug broken , the mother had been crying , the children had probably been beaten ; traces of a vigorous and ill-tempered search . 
It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card , and had made everybody in the garret , from the jug to his wife , responsible for its loss . 
He wore an air of desperation . 
But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success . 
He entered and said : -- `` I have brought you back your shovel and pick . '' 
Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction . 
`` Is it you , peasant ? '' 
`` And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery . '' 
And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
demanded Gribier . 
`` The meaning of it is , that you dropped your card out of your pocket , that I found it on the ground after you were gone , that I have buried the corpse , that I have filled the grave , that I have done your work , that the porter will return your card to you , and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs . 
There you have it , conscript . '' 
`` Thanks , villager ! '' 
exclaimed Gribier , radiant . 
`` The next time I will pay for the drinks . '' 
A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY An hour later , in the darkness of night , two men and a child presented themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus . 
The elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped . 
They were Fauchelevent , Jean Valjean , and Cosette . 
The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer 's in the Rue du Chemin-Vert , where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day . 
Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing . 
She trembled to such a degree that she wept .
