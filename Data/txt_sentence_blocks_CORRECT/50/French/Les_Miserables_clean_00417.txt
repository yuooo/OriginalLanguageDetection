I must sew it up for you . '' 
She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over : -- `` You do n't seem glad to see me . '' 
Marius held his peace ; she remained silent for a moment , then exclaimed : -- `` But if I choose , nevertheless , I could force you to look glad ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
you used to call me thou , '' she retorted . 
`` Well , then , what dost thou mean ? '' 
She bit her lips ; she seemed to hesitate , as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict . 
At last she appeared to come to a decision . 
`` So much the worse , I do n't care . 
You have a melancholy air , I want you to be pleased . 
Only promise me that you will smile . 
I want to see you smile and hear you say : ` Ah , well , that 's good . ' 
Poor Mr. Marius ! 
you know ? 
You promised me that you would give me anything I like -- '' `` Yes ! 
Only speak ! '' 
She looked Marius full in the eye , and said : -- `` I have the address . '' 
Marius turned pale . 
All the blood flowed back to his heart . 
`` What address ? '' 
`` The address that you asked me to get ! '' 
She added , as though with an effort : -- `` The address -- you know very well ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
stammered Marius . 
`` Of that young lady . '' 
This word uttered , she sighed deeply . 
Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly . 
`` Oh ! 
Well ! 
lead me thither ! 
Tell me ! 
Ask of me anything you wish ! 
Where is it ? '' 
`` Come with me , '' she responded . 
`` I do n't know the street or number very well ; it is in quite the other direction from here , but I know the house well , I will take you to it . '' 
She withdrew her hand and went on , in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer , but which did not even graze Marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state : -- `` Oh ! 
how glad you are ! '' 
A cloud swept across Marius ' brow . 
He seized Eponine by the arm : -- `` Swear one thing to me ! '' 
`` Swear ! '' 
said she , `` what does that mean ? 
Come ! 
You want me to swear ? '' 
And she laughed . 
`` Your father ! 
promise me , Eponine ! 
Swear to me that you will not give this address to your father ! ''
