The prisoner reflected a moment . 
`` My enemy must indeed have been very cruel , or hard beset by necessity , to assassinate those two innocent people , my sole support ; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had never harmed a living being . '' 
`` In your family , monseigneur , necessity is stern . 
And so it is necessity which compels me , to my great regret , to tell you that this gentleman and the unhappy lady have been assassinated . '' 
`` Oh , you tell me nothing I am not aware of , '' said the prisoner , knitting his brows . 
`` How ? '' 
`` I suspected it . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` I will tell you . '' 
At this moment the young man , supporting himself on his two elbows , drew close to Aramis 's face , with such an expression of dignity , of self - command and of defiance even , that the bishop felt the electricity of enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his , into his brain of adamant . 
`` Speak , monseigneur . 
I have already told you that by conversing with you I endanger my life . 
Little value as it has , I implore you to accept it as the ransom of your own . '' 
`` Well , '' resumed the young man , `` this is why I suspected they had killed my nurse and my preceptor - '' `` Whom you used to call your father ? '' 
`` Yes ; whom I called my father , but whose son I well knew I was not . '' 
`` Who caused you to suppose so ? '' 
`` Just as you , monsieur , are too respectful for a friend , he was also too respectful for a father . '' 
`` I , however , '' said Aramis , `` have no intention to disguise myself . '' 
The young man nodded assent and continued : `` Undoubtedly , I was not destined to perpetual seclusion , '' said the prisoner ; `` and that which makes me believe so , above all , now , is the care that was taken to render me as accomplished a cavalier as possible . 
The gentleman attached to my person taught me everything he knew himself - mathematics , a little geometry , astronomy , fencing and riding . 
Every morning I went through military exercises , and practiced on horseback . 
Well , one morning during the summer , it being very hot , I went to sleep in the hall . 
Nothing , up to that period , except the respect paid me , had enlightened me , or even roused my suspicions . 
I lived as children , as birds , as plants , as the air and the sun do . 
I had just turned my fifteenth year - '' `` This , then , is eight years ago ? '' 
`` Yes , nearly ; but I have ceased to reckon time . '' 
`` Excuse me ; but what did your tutor tell you , to encourage you to work ? '' 
`` He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself , in the world , that fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth . 
He added that , being a poor , obscure orphan , I had no one but myself to look to ; and that nobody either did , or ever would , take any interest in me . 
I was , then , in the hall I have spoken of , asleep from fatigue with long fencing . 
My preceptor was in his room on the first floor , just over me . 
Suddenly I heard him exclaim , and then he called : ` Perronnette ! 
Perronnette ! ' 
It was my nurse whom he called . '' 
`` Yes , I know it , '' said Aramis . 
`` Continue , monseigneur . '' 
`` Very likely she was in the garden ; for my preceptor came hastily downstairs . 
I rose , anxious at seeing him anxious . 
He opened the garden - door , still crying out , ` Perronnette ! 
Perronnette ! ' 
The windows of the hall looked into the court ; the shutters were closed ; but through a chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well , which was almost directly under the windows of his study . 
He stooped over the brim , looked into the well , and again cried out , and made wild and affrighted gestures . 
Where I was , I could not only see , but hear - and see and hear I did . '' 
`` Go on , I pray you , '' said Aramis . 
`` Dame Perronnette came running up , hearing the governor 's cries . 
He went to meet her , took her by the arm , and drew her quickly towards the edge ; after which , as they both bent over it together , ` Look , look , ' cried he , ` what a misfortune ! ' '' 
` Calm yourself , calm yourself , ' said Perronnette ; ` what is the matter ? ' '' 
` The letter ! ' 
he exclaimed ; ` do you see that letter ? ' 
pointing to the bottom of the well . ''
