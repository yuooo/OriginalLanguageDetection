But , stopping all at once , `` And then she has you for a friend , mademoiselle , '' added he , with a shade of irony which did not glide off the cuirass . 
`` Who ! 
I ? 
- Oh , no ! 
I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere condescends to look upon ; but - '' This but , so big with menace and with storm ; this but , which made the heart of Raoul beat , such griefs did it presage for her whom lately he loved so dearly ; this terrible but , so significant in a woman like Montalais , was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by the speakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting . 
Montalais turned to listen , and Raoul was already rising , when a lady entered the room quietly by the secret door , which she closed after her . 
`` Madame ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king . 
`` Stupid wretch ! '' 
murmured Montalais , throwing herself , but too late , before the princess , `` I have been mistaken in an hour ! '' 
She had , however , time to warn the princess , who was walking towards Raoul . 
`` M. de Bragelonne , Madame , '' and at these words the princess drew back , uttering a cry in her turn . 
`` Your royal highness , '' said Montalais , with volubility , `` is kind enough to think of this lottery , and - '' The princess began to lose countenance . 
Raoul hastened his departure , without divining all , but he felt that he was in the way . 
Madame was preparing a word of transition to recover herself , when a closet opened in front of the alcove , and M. de Guiche issued , all radiant , also from that closet . 
The palest of the four , we must admit , was still Raoul . 
The princess , however , was near fainting , and was obliged to lean upon the foot of the bed for support . 
No one ventured to support her . 
This scene occupied several minutes of terrible suspense . 
But Raoul broke it . 
He went up to the count , whose inexpressible emotion made his knees tremble , and taking his hand , `` Dear count , '' said he , `` tell Madame I am too unhappy not to merit pardon ; tell her also that I have loved in the course of my life , and that the horror of the treachery that has been practiced on me renders me inexorable towards all other treachery that may be committed around me . 
This is why , mademoiselle , '' said he , smiling to Montalais , `` I never would divulge the secret of the visits of my friend to your apartment . 
Obtain from Madame - from Madame , who is so clement and so generous , - obtain her pardon for you whom she has just surprised also . 
You are both free , love each other , be happy ! '' 
The princess felt for a moment a despair that can not be described ; it was repugnant to her , notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul had exhibited , to feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered such an indiscretion . 
It was equally repugnant to her to accept the evasion offered by this delicate deception . 
Agitated , nervous , she struggled against the double stings of these two troubles . 
Raoul comprehended her position , and came once more to her aid . 
Bending his knee before her : `` Madame ! '' 
said he , in a low voice , `` in two days I shall be far from Paris ; in a fortnight I shall be far from France , where I shall never be seen again . '' 
`` Are you going away , then ? '' 
said she , with great delight . 
`` With M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` Into Africa ! '' 
cried De Guiche , in his turn . 
`` You , Raoul - oh ! 
my friend - into Africa , where everybody dies ! '' 
And forgetting everything , forgetting that that forgetfulness itself compromised the princess more eloquently than his presence , `` Ingrate ! '' 
said he , `` and you have not even consulted me ! '' 
And he embraced him ; during which time Montalais had led away Madame , and disappeared herself . 
Raoul passed his hand over his brow , and said , with a smile , `` I have been dreaming ! '' 
Then warmly to Guiche , who by degrees absorbed him , `` My friend , '' said he , `` I conceal nothing from you , who are the elected of my heart . 
I am going to seek death in yonder country ; your secret will not remain in my breast more than a year . '' 
`` Oh , Raoul ! 
a man ! '' 
`` Do you know what is my thought , count ? 
This is it - I shall live more vividly , being buried beneath the earth , than I have lived for this month past . 
We are Christians , my friend , and if such sufferings were to continue , I would not be answerable for the safety of my soul . '' 
De Guiche was anxious to raise objections . 
`` Not one word more on my account , '' said Raoul ; `` but advice to you , dear friend ; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance . ''
