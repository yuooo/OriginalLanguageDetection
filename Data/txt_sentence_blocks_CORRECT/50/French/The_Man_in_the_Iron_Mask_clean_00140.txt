Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . '' 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness , which filled the hearts of all his friends with terror . 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast . 
`` Ah ! 
then , '' said he , `` perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes ? '' 
`` I do not know whither I am setting out , monseigneur . '' 
`` But , '' said Madame Fouquet , recovered from her fright , `` you are not going so soon , monsieur le capitaine , as not to do us the honor to take a seat with us ? '' 
`` Madame , I should esteem that a great honor done me , but I am so pressed for time , that , you see , I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note . '' 
`` The reply to which shall be gold , '' said Fouquet , making a sign to his intendant , who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the latter , `` I was not uneasy about the payment ; the house is good . '' 
A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet . 
`` Are you in pain ? '' 
asked Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do you feel your attack coming on ? '' 
asked Madame Fouquet . 
`` Neither , thank you both , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Your attack ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , in his turn ; `` are you unwell , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I have a tertian fever , which seized me after the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Caught cold in the grottos , at night , perhaps ? '' 
`` No , no ; nothing but agitation , that was all . '' 
`` The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king , '' said La Fontaine , quietly , without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege . 
`` We can not devote too much heart to the reception of our king , '' said Fouquet , mildly , to his poet . 
`` Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , with perfect frankness and much amenity . 
`` The fact is , monseigneur , that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux . '' 
Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted himself well towards the king , the king had hardly done the like to the minister . 
But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret . 
He alone with Fouquet knew it ; those two men had not , the one the courage to complain , the other the right to accuse . 
The captain , to whom the two hundred pistoles were brought , was about to take his leave , when Fouquet , rising , took a glass of wine , and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` to the health of the king , whatever may happen . '' 
`` And to your health , monseigneur , whatever may happen , '' said D'Artagnan . 
He bowed , with these words of evil omen , to all the company , who rose as soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs . 
`` I , for a moment , thought it was I and not my money he wanted , '' said Fouquet , endeavoring to laugh . 
`` You ! '' 
cried his friends ; `` and what for , in the name of Heaven ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
do not deceive yourselves , my dear brothers in Epicurus , '' said the superintendent ; `` I do not wish to make a comparison between the most humble sinner on the earth , and the God we adore , but remember , he gave one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper , and which was nothing but a farewell dinner , like that which we are making at this moment . '' 
A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table . 
`` Shut the doors , '' said Fouquet , and the servants disappeared . 
`` My friends , '' continued Fouquet , lowering his voice , `` what was I formerly ? 
What am I now ? 
Consult among yourselves and reply . 
A man like me sinks when he does not continue to rise . 
What shall we say , then , when he really sinks ? 
I have no more money , no more credit ; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies , and powerless friends . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried Pelisson .
