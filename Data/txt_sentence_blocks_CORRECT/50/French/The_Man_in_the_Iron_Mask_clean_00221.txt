`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured she . 
`` You ! '' 
replied the captain , in a stern voice , `` you here ! 
- oh ! 
madame , I should better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion of the Comte de la Fere . 
You would have wept less - and they too - and I ! '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said she , sobbing . 
`` For it was you , '' added this pitiless friend of the dead , - `` it was you who sped these two men to the grave . '' 
`` Oh ! 
spare me ! '' 
`` God forbid , madame , that I should offend a woman , or that I should make her weep in vain ; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not upon the grave of her victims . '' 
She wished to reply . 
`` What I now tell you , '' added he , coldly , `` I have already told the king . '' 
She clasped her hands . 
`` I know , '' said she , `` I have caused the death of the Vicomte de Bragelonne . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you know it ? '' 
`` The news arrived at court yesterday . 
I have traveled during the night forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte , whom I supposed to be still living , and to pray God , on the tomb of Raoul , that he would send me all the misfortunes I have merited , except a single one . 
Now , monsieur , I know that the death of the son has killed the father ; I have two crimes to reproach myself with ; I have two punishments to expect from Heaven . '' 
`` I will repeat to you , mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan , `` what M. de Bragelonne said of you , at Antibes , when he already meditated death : ` If pride and coquetry have misled her , I pardon her while despising her . 
If love has produced her error , I pardon her , but I swear that no one could have loved her as I have done . ' '' 
`` You know , '' interrupted Louise , `` that of my love I was about to sacrifice myself ; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost , dying , abandoned . 
Well ! 
never have I suffered so much as now ; because then I hoped , desired , - now I have no longer anything to wish for ; because this death drags all my joy into the tomb ; because I can no longer dare to love without remorse , and I feel that he whom I love - oh ! 
it is but just ! 
- will repay me with the tortures I have made others undergo . '' 
D'Artagnan made no reply ; he was too well convinced that she was not mistaken . 
`` Well , then , '' added she , `` dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , do not overwhelm me to-day , I again implore you ! 
I am like the branch torn from the trunk , I no longer hold to anything in this world - a current drags me on , I know not whither . 
I love madly , even to the point of coming to tell it , wretch that I am , over the ashes of the dead , and I do not blush for it - I have no remorse on this account . 
Such love is a religion . 
Only , as hereafter you will see me alone , forgotten , disdained ; as you will see me punished , as I am destined to be punished , spare me in my ephemeral happiness , leave it to me for a few days , for a few minutes . 
Now , even at the moment I am speaking to you , perhaps it no longer exists . 
My God ! 
this double murder is perhaps already expiated ! '' 
While she was speaking thus , the sound of voices and of horses drew the attention of the captain . 
M. de Saint-Aignan came to seek La Valliere . 
`` The king , '' he said , `` is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness . '' 
Saint - Aignan did not perceive D'Artagnan , half concealed by the trunk of a chestnut-tree which shaded the double grave . 
Louise thanked Saint - Aignan , and dismissed him with a gesture . 
He rejoined the party outside the inclosure . 
`` You see , madame , '' said the captain bitterly to the young woman , - `` you see your happiness still lasts . '' 
The young woman raised her head with a solemn air . 
`` A day will come , '' said she , `` when you will repent of having so misjudged me . 
On that day , it is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards me . 
Besides , I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first to pity my sufferings . 
Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; it costs me dear , and I have not paid all my debt . ''
