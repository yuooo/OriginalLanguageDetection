Well ! 
M. Colbert takes care not to pass me . 
He is a prudent man is M. Colbert . '' 
He was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes , watching each other . 
When the surintendant landed , Gourville hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once , and have the relays prepared . 
But , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first , and Colbert , approaching Fouquet , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect - marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse . 
Fouquet was completely self-possessed ; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself . 
He wished to fall from such a height that his fall should crush some of his enemies . 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert . 
The surintendant , therefore , coming up to him , replied , with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him - `` What ! 
is that you , M. Colbert ? '' 
`` To offer you my respects , monseigneur , '' said the latter . 
`` Were you in that lighter ? '' 
- pointing to the one with twelve rowers . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Of twelve rowers ? '' 
said Fouquet ; `` what luxury , M. Colbert . 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
- and Colbert blushed . 
`` This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear , Monsieur l'Intendant ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` But you have , happily , arrived ! 
-- You see , however , '' added he , a moment after , `` that I , who had but eight rowers , arrived before you . '' 
And he turned his back towards him , leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first . 
At least he did not give him the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened . 
Colbert , so annoyingly attacked , did not give way . 
`` I have not been quick , monseigneur , '' he replied , `` because I followed your example whenever you stopped . '' 
`` And why did you do that , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
cried Fouquet , irritated by the base audacity ; `` as you had a superior crew to mine , why did you not either join me or pass me ? '' 
`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . '' 
`` Bon jour ! 
monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer ; `` how did you get through the journey ? '' 
`` Tolerably well , thank you . '' 
`` And the fever ? '' 
`` But poorly . 
I drink , as you perceive . 
I am scarcely arrived , and I have already levied a contribution of tisane upon Nantes . '' 
`` You should sleep first , monseigneur . '' 
`` Eh ! 
corbleu !
