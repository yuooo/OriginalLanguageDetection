As soon as he had found himself released from his bonds , and while Javert was drawing up his report , he had taken advantage of confusion , the crowd , the darkness , and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him , to dash out of the window . 
An agent sprang to the opening and looked out . 
He saw no one outside . 
The rope ladder was still shaking . 
`` The devil ! '' 
ejaculated Javert between his teeth , `` he must have been the most valuable of the lot . '' 
THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO On the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the Boulevard de l'Hopital , a child , who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz , was ascending the side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barriere de Fontainebleau . 
Night had fully come . 
This lad was pale , thin , clad in rags , with linen trousers in the month of February , and was singing at the top of his voice . 
At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier , a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern ; the child jostled her as he passed , then recoiled , exclaiming : -- `` Hello ! 
And I took it for an enormous , enormous dog ! '' 
He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals : `` an enormous , ENORMOUS dog . '' 
The old woman straightened herself up in a fury . 
`` Nasty brat ! '' 
she grumbled . 
`` If I had n't been bending over , I know well where I would have planted my foot on you . '' 
The boy was already far away . 
`` Kisss ! 
kisss ! '' 
he cried . 
`` After that , I do n't think I was mistaken ! '' 
The old woman , choking with indignation , now rose completely upright , and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face , all hollowed into angles and wrinkles , with crow 's - feet meeting the corners of her mouth . 
Her body was lost in the darkness , and only her head was visible . 
One would have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light from the night . 
The boy surveyed her . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me . '' 
He then pursued his road , and resumed his song : -- `` Le roi Coupdesabot S'en allait a la chasse , A la chasse aux corbeaux -- '' At the end of these three lines he paused . 
He had arrived in front of No. 50-52 , and finding the door fastened , he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks , which betrayed rather the man 's shoes that he was wearing than the child 's feet which he owned . 
In the meanwhile , the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him , uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures . 
`` What 's this ? 
What 's this ? 
Lord God ! 
He 's battering the door down ! 
He 's knocking the house down . '' 
The kicks continued . 
The old woman strained her lungs . 
`` Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays ? '' 
All at once she paused . 
She had recognized the gamin . 
`` What ! 
so it 's that imp ! '' 
`` Why , it 's the old lady , '' said the lad . 
`` Good day , Bougonmuche . 
I have come to see my ancestors . '' 
The old woman retorted with a composite grimace , and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness , which was , unfortunately , wasted in the dark : -- `` There 's no one here . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
retorted the boy , `` where 's my father ? '' 
`` At La Force . '' 
`` Come , now ! 
And my mother ? ''
