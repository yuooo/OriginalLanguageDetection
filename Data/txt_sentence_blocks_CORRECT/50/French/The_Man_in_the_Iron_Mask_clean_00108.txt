And , M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos , they entered the house , followed by Raoul , who walked respectfully and modestly among the officers of the prince , with several of whom he was acquainted . 
: Monsieur de Beaufort . 
The prince turned round at the moment when Raoul , in order to leave him alone with Athos , was shutting the door , and preparing to go with the other officers into an adjoining apartment . 
`` Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of ? '' 
asked M. de Beaufort . 
`` It is , monseigneur . '' 
`` He is quite the soldier ; let him stay , count , we can not spare him . '' 
`` Remain , Raoul , since monseigneur permits it , '' said Athos . 
`` Ma foi ! 
he is tall and handsome ! '' 
continued the duke . 
`` Will you give him to me , monseigneur , if I ask him of you ? '' 
`` How am I to understand you , monseigneur ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Why , I call upon you to bid you farewell . '' 
`` Farewell ! '' 
`` Yes , in good truth . 
Have you no idea of what I am about to become ? '' 
`` Why , I suppose , what you have always been , monseigneur , - a valiant prince , and an excellent gentleman . '' 
`` I am going to become an African prince , - a Bedouin gentleman . 
The king is sending me to make conquests among the Arabs . '' 
`` What is this you tell me , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Strange , is it not ? 
I , the Parisian par essence , I who have reigned in the faubourgs , and have been called King of the Halles , - I am going to pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli ; from a Frondeur I am becoming an adventurer ! '' 
`` Oh , monseigneur , if you did not yourself tell me that - '' `` It would not be credible , would it ? 
Believe me , nevertheless , and we have but to bid each other farewell . 
This is what comes of getting into favor again . '' 
`` Into favor ? '' 
`` Yes . 
You smile . 
Ah , my dear count , do you know why I have accepted this enterprise , can you guess ? '' 
`` Because your highness loves glory above - everything . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no ; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages . 
I see no glory in that , for my part , and it is more probable that I shall there meet with something else . 
But I have wished , and still wish earnestly , my dear count , that my life should have that last facet , after all the whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years . 
For , in short , you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born the grandson of a king , to have made war against kings , to have been reckoned among the powers of the age , to have maintained my rank , to feel Henry IV . 
within me , to be great admiral of France - and then to go and get killed at Gigelli , among all those Turks , Saracens , and Moors . '' 
`` Monseigneur , you harp with strange persistence on that theme , '' said Athos , in an agitated voice . 
`` How can you suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene ? '' 
`` And can you believe , upright and simple as you are , that if I go into Africa for this ridiculous motive , I will not endeavor to come out of it without ridicule ? 
Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me ? 
And to be spoken of , nowadays , when there are Monsieur le Prince , M. de Turenne , and many others , my contemporaries , I , admiral of France , grandson of Henry IV. , king of Paris , have I anything left but to get myself killed ? 
Cordieu ! 
I will be talked of , I tell you ; I shall be killed whether or not ; if no there , somewhere else . '' 
`` Why , monseigneur , this is mere exaggeration ; and hitherto you have shown nothing exaggerated save in bravery . '' 
`` Peste ! 
my dear friend , there is bravery in facing scurvy , dysentery , locusts , poisoned arrows , as my ancestor St. Louis did . 
Do you know those fellows still use poisoned arrows ? 
And then , you know me of old , I fancy , and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing , I perform it in grim earnest . ''
