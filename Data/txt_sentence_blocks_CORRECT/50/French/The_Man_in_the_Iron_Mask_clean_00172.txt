`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` That for ampler information , he would speak with monseigneur . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` On board his own vessel . '' 
`` On board his vessel ! '' 
and Porthos repeated , `` On board his vessel ! '' 
`` M. le mousquetaire , '' continued Jonathan , `` told me to take you both on board my canoe , and bring you to him . '' 
`` Let us go at once , '' exclaimed Porthos . 
`` Dear D'Artagnan ! '' 
But Aramis stopped him . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Who knows that it is not a snare ? '' 
`` Of the other king 's ? '' 
said Porthos , mysteriously . 
`` A snare , in fact ! 
That 's what it is , my friend . '' 
`` Very possibly ; what is to be done , then ? 
If D'Artagnan sends for us - '' `` Who assures you that D'Artagnan sends for us ? '' 
`` Well , but - but his writing - '' `` Writing is easily counterfeited . 
This looks counterfeited - unsteady - '' `` You are always right ; but , in the meantime , we know nothing . '' 
Aramis was silent . 
`` It is true , '' said the good Porthos , `` we do not want to know anything . '' 
`` What shall I do ? '' 
asked Jonathan . 
`` You will return on board this captain 's vessel . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I comprehend ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Yes , monseigneur , '' replied Jonathan ; `` but if the captain should refuse to come to Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` If he refuses , as we have cannon , we will make use of them . '' 
`` What ! 
against D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` If it is D'Artagnan , Porthos , he will come . 
Go , Jonathan , go ! '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I no longer comprehend anything , '' murmured Porthos . 
`` I will make you comprehend it all , my dear friend ; the time for it has come ; sit down upon this gun-carriage , open your ears , and listen well to me . '' 
`` Oh ! 
pardieu ! 
I will listen , no fear of that . '' 
`` May I depart , monseigneur ? '' 
cried Jonathan . 
`` Yes , begone , and bring back an answer . 
Allow the canoe to pass , you men there ! '' 
And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet . 
Aramis took Porthos by the hand , and commenced his explanations .
