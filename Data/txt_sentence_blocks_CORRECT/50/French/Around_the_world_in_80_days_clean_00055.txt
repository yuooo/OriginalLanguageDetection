`` When and where you will , '' replied the American , `` and with whatever weapon you choose . '' 
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his . 
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . 
Phileas Fogg left the car , and the American followed him upon the platform . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to his adversary , `` I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . '' 
`` Well , what 's that to me ? '' 
replied Colonel Proctor . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , very politely , `` after our meeting at San Francisco , I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England . '' 
`` Really ! '' 
`` Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ? '' 
`` Why not ten years hence ? '' 
`` I say six months , '' returned Phileas Fogg ; `` and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly . '' 
`` All this is an evasion , '' cried Stamp Proctor . 
`` Now or never ! '' 
`` Very good . 
You are going to New York ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Chicago ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Omaha ? '' 
`` What difference is it to you ? 
Do you know Plum Creek ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the next station . 
The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes . 
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I will stop at Plum Creek . '' 
`` And I guess you 'll stay there too , '' added the American insolently . 
`` Who knows ? '' 
replied Mr. Fogg , returning to the car as coolly as usual . 
He began to reassure Aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse . 
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness . 
At eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station . 
Mr. Fogg rose , and , followed by Fix , went out upon the platform . 
Passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . 
Aouda remained in the car , as pale as death . 
The door of the next car opened , and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second . 
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , `` You ca n't get off , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop . '' 
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once . 
There 's the bell ringing now . '' 
The train started . 
`` I 'm really very sorry , gentlemen , '' said the conductor . 
`` Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you . 
But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ? 
`` That would n't be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , '' said the colonel , in a jeering tone .
