It is the language of wretchedness . 
We may be stopped ; the fact may be put to us in general terms , which is one way of attenuating it ; we may be told , that all trades , professions , it may be added , all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence , have their own slang .

No doubt . 
But say what we will , this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit . 
For our part , we reserve to the word its ancient and precise , circumscribed and determined significance , and we restrict slang to slang . 
The veritable slang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang , if the two words can be coupled thus , the slang immemorial which was a kingdom , is nothing else , we repeat , than the homely , uneasy , crafty , treacherous , venomous , cruel , equivocal , vile , profound , fatal tongue of wretchedness . 
There exists , at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes , a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights ; a fearful conflict , where , now cunning , now violent , unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time , it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice , and with club-blows through crime . 
To meet the needs of this conflict , wretchedness has invented a language of combat , which is slang . 
To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion , to hold above the gulf , were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would , otherwise , be lost , that is to say , one of the elements , good or bad , of which civilization is composed , or by which it is complicated , to extend the records of social observation ; is to serve civilization itself . 
This service Plautus rendered , consciously or unconsciously , by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician ; that service Moliere rendered , by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects . 
Here objections spring up afresh . 
Phoenician , very good ! 
Levantine , quite right ! 
Even dialect , let that pass ! 
They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces ; but slang ! 
What is the use of preserving slang ? 
What is the good of assisting slang `` to survive '' ? 
To this we reply in one word , only . 
Assuredly , if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest , the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study . 
It is the language which has been spoken , in France , for example , for more than four centuries , not only by a misery , but by every possible human misery . 
And then , we insist upon it , the study of social deformities and infirmities , and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy , is not a business in which choice is permitted . 
The historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events . 
The latter has the surface of civilization , the conflicts of crowns , the births of princes , the marriages of kings , battles , assemblages , great public men , revolutions in the daylight , everything on the exterior ; the other historian has the interior , the depths , the people who toil , suffer , wait , the oppressed woman , the agonizing child , the secret war between man and man , obscure ferocities , prejudices , plotted iniquities , the subterranean , the indistinct tremors of multitudes , the die-of-hunger , the counter-blows of the law , the secret evolution of souls , the go-bare-foot , the bare-armed , the disinherited , the orphans , the unhappy , and the infamous , all the forms which roam through the darkness . 
He must descend with his heart full of charity , and severity at the same time , as a brother and as a judge , to those impenetrable casemates where crawl , pell-mell , those who bleed and those who deal the blow , those who weep and those who curse , those who fast and those who devour , those who endure evil and those who inflict it . 
Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts ? 
Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli ? 
Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre ? 
Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern ? 
Let us say , moreover , parenthetically , that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind . 
No one is a good historian of the patent , visible , striking , and public life of peoples , if he is not , at the same time , in a certain measure , the historian of their deep and hidden life ; and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how , at need , to be the historian of the exterior also . 
The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events , and this is true reciprocally . 
They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other , which are always interlaced , and which often bring forth results . 
All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels , sombre but distinct , in their depths , and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface . 
True history being a mixture of all things , the true historian mingles in everything .
