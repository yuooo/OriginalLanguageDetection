`` Humph ! 
you must have one , then , '' said Athos , phlegmatically , `` if only to prevent your little fortune being lost . '' 
This word little fortune placed Planchet in his rank , like the voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a piqueur in the regiment of Piedmont , in which Rochefort had placed him . 
Athos perceived that the grocer would marry Truchen , and , in spite of fate , establish a family . 
This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin . 
Having heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer , `` What is M. d'Artagnan about ? '' 
said he ; `` he is not at the Louvre . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte , Monsieur d'Artagnan has disappeared . '' 
`` Disappeared ! '' 
said Athos , in surprise . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur , we know what that means . '' 
`` But I do not know . '' 
`` Whenever M. d'Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some great affair . '' 
`` Has he said anything to you about it ? '' 
`` Never . '' 
`` You were acquainted with his departure for England formerly , were you not ? '' 
`` On account of the speculation . '' 
said Planchet , heedlessly . 
`` The speculation ! '' 
`` I mean - '' interrupted Planchet , quite confused . 
`` Well , well ; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question ; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you . 
Since the captain of the musketeers is not here , and as we can not learn from you where we are likely to find M. d'Artagnan , we will take our leave of you . 
Au revoir , Planchet , au revoir . 
Let us be gone , Raoul . '' 
`` Monsieur le comte , I wish I were able to tell you - '' `` Oh , not at all ; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion . '' 
This word `` servant '' struck rudely on the ears of the demi-millionnaire Planchet , but natural respect and bonhomie prevailed over pride . 
`` There is nothing indiscreet in telling you , monsieur le comte , M. d'Artagnan came here the other day - '' `` Aha ? '' 
`` And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart . '' 
`` You are right , then , my friend ; say no more about it . '' 
`` And the chart is there as a proof , '' added Planchet , who went to fetch from the neighboring wall , where it was suspended by a twist , forming a triangle with the bar of the window to which it was fastened , the plan consulted by the captain on his last visit to Planchet . 
This plan , which he brought to the comte , was a map of France , upon which the practiced eye of that gentleman discovered an itinerary , marked out with small pins ; wherever a pin was missing , a hole denoted its having been there . 
Athos , by following with his eye the pins and holes , saw that D'Artagnan had taken the direction of the south , and gone as far as the Mediterranean , towards Toulon . 
It was near Cannes that the marks and the punctured places ceased . 
The Comte de la Fere puzzled his brains for some time , to divine what the musketeer could be going to do at Cannes , and what motive could have led him to examine the banks of the Var . 
The reflections of Athos suggested nothing . 
His accustomed perspicacity was at fault . 
Raoul 's researches were not more successful than his father 's . 
`` Never mind , '' said the young man to the comte , who silently , and with his finger , had made him understand the route of D'Artagnan ; `` we must confess that there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our destiny with that of M. d'Artagnan . 
There he is on the coast of Cannes , and you , monsieur , will , at least , conduct me as far as Toulon . 
Be assured that we shall meet with him more easily upon our route than on this map . '' 
Then , taking leave of Planchet , who was scolding his shopmen , even the cousin of Truchen , his successor , the gentlemen set out to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort . 
On leaving the grocer 's shop , they saw a coach , the future depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Truchen and Planchet 's bags of crowns . 
`` Every one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses , '' said Raoul , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Road to Fontainebleau ! '' 
cried Planchet to his coachman . 
: The Inventory of M. de Beaufort . 
To have talked of D'Artagnan with Planchet , to have seen Planchet quit Paris to bury himself in his country retreat , had been for Athos and his son like a last farewell to the noise of the capital - to their life of former days . 
What , in fact , did these men leave behind them - one of whom had exhausted the past age in glory , and the other , the present age in misfortune ?
