And she offered him her cheek . 
Jean Valjean remained motionless . 
`` You do not stir . 
I take note of it . 
Attitude of guilt . 
But never mind , I pardon you . 
Jesus Christ said : Offer the other cheek . 
Here it is . '' 
And she presented her other cheek . 
Jean Valjean did not move . 
It seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement . 
`` This is becoming serious , '' said Cosette . 
`` What have I done to you ? 
I declare that I am perplexed . 
You owe me reparation . 
You will dine with us . '' 
`` I have dined . '' 
`` That is not true . 
I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you . 
Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers . 
Come . 
Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room . 
Immediately . '' 
`` Impossible . '' 
Here Cosette lost ground a little . 
She ceased to command and passed to questioning . 
`` But why ? 
and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me . 
It 's horrible here . '' 
`` Thou knowest ... '' Jean Valjean caught himself up . 
`` You know , madame , that I am peculiar , I have my freaks . '' 
Cosette struck her tiny hands together . 
`` Madame ! 
... You know ! 
... more novelties ! 
What is the meaning of this ? '' 
Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse : `` You wished to be Madame . 
You are so . '' 
`` Not for you , father . '' 
`` Do not call me father . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Call me ` Monsieur Jean . ' 
` Jean , ' if you like . '' 
`` You are no longer my father ? 
I am no longer Cosette ? 
` Monsieur Jean ' ? 
What does this mean ? 
why , these are revolutions , are n't they ? 
what has taken place ? 
come , look me in the face .
