He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world , a permission to eat eggs , a Lenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his `` flock . '' 
Bahorel exclaimed : -- '' ` Flock ' ; a polite way of saying geese . '' 
And he tore the charge from the nail . 
This conquered Gavroche . 
From that instant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel . 
`` Bahorel , '' observed Enjolras , `` you are wrong . 
You should have let that charge alone , he is not the person with whom we have to deal , you are wasting your wrath to no purpose . 
Take care of your supply . 
One does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun . '' 
`` Each one in his own fashion , Enjolras , '' retorted Bahorel . 
`` This bishop 's prose shocks me ; I want to eat eggs without being permitted . 
Your style is the hot and cold ; I am amusing myself . 
Besides , I 'm not wasting myself , I 'm getting a start ; and if I tore down that charge , Hercle ! 
't was only to whet my appetite . '' 
This word , Hercle , struck Gavroche . 
He sought all occasions for learning , and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem . 
He inquired of him : -- `` What does Hercle mean ? '' 
Bahorel answered : -- `` It means cursed name of a dog , in Latin . '' 
Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed , probably a Friend of the A B C . 
He shouted to him : -- `` Quick , cartridges , para bellum . '' 
`` A fine man ! 
that 's true , '' said Gavroche , who now understood Latin . 
A tumultuous retinue accompanied them , -- students , artists , young men affiliated to the Cougourde of Aix , artisans , longshoremen , armed with clubs and bayonets ; some , like Combeferre , with pistols thrust into their trousers . 
An old man , who appeared to be extremely aged , was walking in the band . 
He had no arms , and he made great haste , so that he might not be left behind , although he had a thoughtful air . 
Gavroche caught sight of him : -- `` Keksekca ? '' 
said he to Courfeyrac . 
`` He 's an old duffer . '' 
It was M. Mabeuf . 
THE OLD MAN Let us recount what had taken place . 
Enjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon , near the public storehouses , at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge . 
Enjolras , Courfeyrac , and Combeferre were among those who had taken to the Rue Bassompierre , shouting : `` To the barricades ! '' 
In the Rue Lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along . 
What had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag , as though he were intoxicated . 
Moreover , he had his hat in his hand , although it had been raining all the morning , and was raining pretty briskly at the very time . 
Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf . 
He knew him through having many times accompanied Marius as far as his door . 
As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector , and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar , a couple of paces from the cavalry charges , almost in the midst of a fusillade , hatless in the rain , and strolling about among the bullets , he had accosted him , and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian : -- `` M. Mabeuf , go to your home . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` There 's going to be a row . '' 
`` That 's well . '' 
`` Thrusts with the sword and firing , M. Mabeuf . '' 
`` That is well . '' 
`` Firing from cannon . '' 
`` That is good . 
Where are the rest of you going ? '' 
`` We are going to fling the government to the earth . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
And he had set out to follow them . 
From that moment forth he had not uttered a word .
