He had dropped his eyelids again , and became absorbed in thought . 
`` As for Father What 's - his-name , I think I recognize him . 
Here , I 've burned my coat . 
They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves . 
Number 50-52 . 
Former property of Gorbeau . '' 
Then he glanced at Marius . 
`` You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man ? '' 
`` And Panchaud . '' 
`` You did n't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor a big lump of matter , resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` As for the fourth , no one sees him , not even his adjutants , clerks , and employees . 
It is not surprising that you did not see him . '' 
`` No . 
Who are all those persons ? '' 
asked Marius . 
The inspector answered : -- `` Besides , this is not the time for them . '' 
He relapsed into silence , then resumed : -- `` 50-52 . 
I know that barrack . 
Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us , and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville . 
They are so modest ! 
An audience embarrasses them . 
None of that , none of that . 
I want to hear them sing and make them dance . '' 
This monologue concluded , he turned to Marius , and demanded , gazing at him intently the while : -- `` Are you afraid ? '' 
`` Of what ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` Of these men ? '' 
`` No more than yourself ! '' 
retorted Marius rudely , who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said `` monsieur '' to him . 
The inspector stared still more intently at Marius , and continued with sententious solemnity : -- `` There , you speak like a brave man , and like an honest man . 
Courage does not fear crime , and honesty does not fear authority . '' 
Marius interrupted him : -- `` That is well , but what do you intend to do ? '' 
The inspector contented himself with the remark : -- `` The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night . 
You must have one . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Marius . 
`` Have you it about you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Give it to me , '' said the inspector . 
Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket , handed it to the inspector and added : -- `` If you will take my advice , you will come in force . '' 
The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him ; with one movement he plunged his hands , which were enormous , into the two immense pockets of his top-coat , and pulled out two small steel pistols , of the sort called `` knock-me-downs . '' 
Then he presented them to Marius , saying rapidly , in a curt tone : -- `` Take these . 
Go home . 
Hide in your chamber , so that you may be supposed to have gone out . 
They are loaded . 
Each one carries two balls .
