As for M. de Baisemeaux , with the facility of vulgar people , he gave himself up entirely upon this point of his guest 's freedom . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur . '' 
`` By no means , '' said Aramis ; `` call me monsieur ; I am booted . '' 
`` Do you know , monsieur , of whom you remind me this evening ? '' 
`` No ! 
faith , '' said Aramis , taking up his glass ; `` but I hope I remind you of a capital guest . '' 
`` You remind me of two , monsieur . 
Francois , shut the window ; the wind may annoy his greatness . '' 
`` And let him go , '' added Aramis . 
`` The supper is completely served , and we shall eat it very well without waiters . 
I like exceedingly to be tete-a - tete when I am with a friend . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed respectfully . 
`` I like exceedingly , '' continued Aramis , `` to help myself . '' 
`` Retire , Francois , '' cried Baisemeaux . 
`` I was saying that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons ; one very illustrious , the late cardinal , the great Cardinal de la Rochelle , who wore boots like you . '' 
`` Indeed , '' said Aramis ; `` and the other ? '' 
`` The other was a certain musketeer , very handsome , very brave , very adventurous , very fortunate , who , from being abbe , turned musketeer , and from musketeer turned abbe . '' 
Aramis condescended to smile . 
`` From abbe , '' continued Baisemeaux , encouraged by Aramis 's smile - `` from abbe , bishop - and from bishop - '' `` Ah ! 
stay there , I beg , '' exclaimed Aramis . 
`` I have just said , monsieur , that you gave me the idea of a cardinal . '' 
`` Enough , dear M. Baisemeaux . 
As you said , I have on the boots of a cavalier , but I do not intend , for all that , to embroil myself with the church this evening . '' 
`` But you have wicked intentions , nevertheless , monseigneur . '' 
`` Oh , yes , wicked , I own , as everything mundane is . '' 
`` You traverse the town and the streets in disguise ? '' 
`` In disguise , as you say . '' 
`` And you still make use of your sword ? '' 
`` Yes , I should think so ; but only when I am compelled . 
Do me the pleasure to summon Francois . '' 
`` Have you no wine there ? '' '' 
'T is not for wine , but because it is hot here , and the window is shut . '' 
`` I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the arrival of couriers . '' 
`` Ah , yes . 
You hear them when the window is open ? '' 
`` But too well , and that disturbs me . 
You understand ? '' 
`` Nevertheless I am suffocated . 
Francois . '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Open the windows , I pray you , Master Francois , '' said Aramis . 
`` You will allow him , dear M. Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` You are at home here , '' answered the governor . 
The window was opened . 
`` Do you not think , '' said M. de Baisemeaux , `` that you will find yourself very lonely , now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at Blois ? 
He is a very old friend , is he not ? '' 
`` You know it as I do , Baisemeaux , seeing that you were in the musketeers with us . '' 
`` Bah ! 
with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years . '' 
`` And you are right .
