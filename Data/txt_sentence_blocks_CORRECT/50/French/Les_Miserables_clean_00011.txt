In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived . 
He was making his circuit to Chastelar . 
The mayor came to meet him , and urged him to retrace his steps . 
Cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche , and beyond ; there was danger even with an escort ; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose . 
`` Therefore , '' said the Bishop , `` I intend to go without escort . '' 
`` You do not really mean that , Monseigneur ! '' 
exclaimed the mayor . 
`` I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes , and shall set out in an hour . '' 
`` Set out ? '' 
`` Set out . '' 
`` Alone ? '' 
`` Alone . '' 
`` Monseigneur , you will not do that ! '' 
`` There exists yonder in the mountains , '' said the Bishop , a tiny community no bigger than that , which I have not seen for three years . 
They are my good friends , those gentle and honest shepherds . 
They own one goat out of every thirty that they tend . 
They make very pretty woollen cords of various colors , and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes . 
They need to be told of the good God now and then . 
What would they say to a bishop who was afraid ? 
What would they say if I did not go ? '' 
`` But the brigands , Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Hold , '' said the Bishop , `` I must think of that . 
You are right . 
I may meet them . 
They , too , need to be told of the good God . '' 
`` But , Monseigneur , there is a band of them ! 
A flock of wolves ! '' 
`` Monsieur le maire , it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd . 
Who knows the ways of Providence ? '' 
`` They will rob you , Monseigneur . '' 
`` I have nothing . '' 
`` They will kill you . '' 
`` An old goodman of a priest , who passes along mumbling his prayers ? 
Bah ! 
To what purpose ? '' 
`` Oh , mon Dieu ! 
what if you should meet them ! '' 
`` I should beg alms of them for my poor . '' 
`` Do not go , Monseigneur . 
In the name of Heaven ! 
You are risking your life ! '' 
`` Monsieur le maire , '' said the Bishop , `` is that really all ? 
I am not in the world to guard my own life , but to guard souls . '' 
They had to allow him to do as he pleased . 
He set out , accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide . 
His obstinacy was bruited about the country-side , and caused great consternation . 
He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire . 
He traversed the mountain on mule-back , encountered no one , and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his `` good friends , '' the shepherds . 
He remained there for a fortnight , preaching , administering the sacrament , teaching , exhorting . 
When the time of his departure approached , he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically .
