`` M. Fouquet , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` is in the iron cage that M. Colbert had prepared for him , and is galloping as fast as four strong horses can drag him , towards Angers . '' 
`` Why did you leave him on the road ? '' 
`` Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers . 
The proof , the best proof of what I advance , is that the king desired me to be sought for but this minute . 
And then I had another reason . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Whilst I was with him , poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the king , astonished . 
`` Your majesty ought to understand , and does understand , certainly , that my warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty . 
I have given him one of my brigadiers , the most stupid I could find among my musketeers , in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping . '' 
`` Are you mad , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
cried the king , crossing his arms on his breast . 
`` Do people utter such enormities , even when they have the misfortune to think them ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
sire , you can not expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet , after what he has just done for you and me . 
No , no ; if you desire that he should remain under your lock and bolt , never give him in charge to me ; however closely wired might be the cage , the bird would , in the end , take wing . '' 
`` I am surprised , '' said the king , in his sternest tone , `` you did not follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne . 
You had in him all you want - affection , gratitude . 
In my service , monsieur , you will only find a master . '' 
`` If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , with a deeply impressive manner , `` one single man would have gone there , and I should have been that man - you know that right well , sire . '' 
The king was brought to a pause . 
Before that speech of his captain of the musketeers , so frankly spoken and so true , the king had nothing to offer . 
On hearing D'Artagnan , Louis remembered the D'Artagnan of former times ; him who , at the Palais Royal , held himself concealed behind the curtains of his bed , when the people of Paris , led by Cardinal de Retz , came to assure themselves of the presence of the king ; the D'Artagnan whom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage , when repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris ; the soldier who had quitted his service at Blois ; the lieutenant he had recalled to be beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power ; the man he had always found loyal , courageous , devoted . 
Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert . 
Colbert had not left the corridor where the secretaries were at work . 
He reappeared . 
`` Colbert , did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` What has it produced ? '' 
`` M. de Roncherolles , who was sent with your majesty 's musketeers , has remitted me some papers , '' replied Colbert . 
`` I will look at them . 
Give me your hand . '' 
`` My hand , sire ! '' 
`` Yes , that I may place it in that of M. d'Artagnan . 
In fact , M. d'Artagnan , '' added he , with a smile , turning towards the soldier , who , at sight of the clerk , had resumed his haughty attitude , `` you do not know this man ; make his acquaintance . '' 
And he pointed to Colbert . 
`` He has been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions , but he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
stammered Colbert , confused with pleasure and fear . 
`` I always understood why , '' murmured D'Artagnan in the king 's ear ; `` he was jealous . '' 
`` Precisely , and his jealousy confined his wings . '' 
`` He will henceforward be a winged-serpent , '' grumbled the musketeer , with a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary . 
But Colbert , approaching him , offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear ; he appeared so good , so mild , so easy ; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble , that D'Artagnan , a connoisseur in physiognomies , was moved , and almost changed in his convictions . 
Colbert pressed his hand . 
`` That which the king has just told you , monsieur , proves how well his majesty is acquainted with men . 
The inveterate opposition I have displayed , up to this day , against abuses and not against men , proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign , for my country a great blessing . 
I have many ideas , M. d'Artagnan . 
You will see them expand in the sun of public peace ; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men , I am at least certain , monsieur , that I shall obtain their esteem . 
For their admiration , monsieur , I would give my life . ''
