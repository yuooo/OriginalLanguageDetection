`` Your place , M. Colbert , '' the duchesse hastened to say , `` must be a high place . 
Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself , after the fall of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` I do not understand , '' said he . 
`` You will understand . 
To what does your ambition aspire ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` It was useless , then , to overthrow the superintendent , Monsieur Colbert . 
It was idle . '' 
`` I had the honor to tell you , madame - '' `` Oh ! 
yes , I know , all about the interest of the king - but , if you please , we will speak of your own . '' 
`` Mine ! 
that is to say , the affairs of his majesty . '' 
`` In short , are you , or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet ? 
Answer without evasion . '' 
`` Madame , I ruin nobody . '' 
`` I am endeavoring to comprehend , then , why you purchased from me the letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet . 
Neither can I conceive why you have laid those letters before the king . '' 
Colbert , half stupefied , looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` I can less easily conceive how you , who received the money , can reproach me on that head - '' `` That is , '' said the old duchesse , `` because we must will that which we wish for , unless we are not able to obtain what we wish . '' 
`` Will ! '' 
said Colbert , quite confounded by such coarse logic . 
`` You are not able , hein ! 
Speak . '' 
`` I am not able , I allow , to destroy certain influences near the king . '' 
`` That fight in favor of M. Fouquet ? 
What are they ? 
Stop , let me help you . '' 
`` Do , madame . '' 
`` La Valliere ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
very little influence ; no knowledge of business , and small means . 
M. Fouquet has paid his court to her . '' 
`` To defend him would be to accuse herself , would it not ? '' 
`` I think it would . '' 
`` There is still another influence , what do you say to that ? '' 
`` Is it considerable ? '' 
`` The queen-mother , perhaps ? '' 
`` Her majesty , the queen-mother , has a weakness for M. Fouquet very prejudicial to her son . '' 
`` Never believe that , '' said the old duchesse , smiling . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Colbert , with incredulity , `` I have often experienced it . '' 
`` Formerly ? '' 
`` Very recently , madame , at Vaux . 
It was she who prevented the king from having M. Fouquet arrested . '' 
`` People do not forever entertain the same opinions , my dear monsieur . 
That which the queen may have wished recently , she would not wish , perhaps , to-day . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
said Colbert , astonished . 
`` Oh ! 
the reason is of very little consequence . ''
