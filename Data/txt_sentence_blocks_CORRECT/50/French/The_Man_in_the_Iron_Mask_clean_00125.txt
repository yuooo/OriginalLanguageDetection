said the governor , sharply . 
`` And yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan took it out of his hands , effacing the characters with the point of his sword . 
`` How ! '' 
cried the governor , `` what are you doing ? 
I can not read them now ! '' 
`` It is a state secret , '' replied D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and as you know that , according to the king 's orders , it is under the penalty of death any one should penetrate it , I will , if you like , allow you to read it , and have you shot immediately afterwards . '' 
During this apostrophe - half serious , half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the coolest , most unconcerned silence . 
`` But , is it possible , '' said the governor , `` that these gentlemen do not comprehend at least some words ? '' 
`` Suppose they do ! 
If they do understand a few spoken words , it does not follow that they should understand what is written . 
They can not even read Spanish . 
A noble Spaniard , remember , ought never to know how to read . '' 
The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations , but he was still tenacious . 
`` Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress , '' said he . 
`` That I will willingly do . 
I was about to propose it to you . '' 
The fact is , the captain had quite another idea , and would have wished his friends a hundred leagues off . 
But he was obliged to make the best of it . 
He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish , giving them a polite invitation , which they accepted . 
They all turned towards the entrance of the fort , and , the incident being at an end , the eight soldiers returned to their delightful leisure , for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure . 
: Captive and Jailers . 
When they had entered the fort , and whilst the governor was making some preparations for the reception of his guests , `` Come , '' said Athos , `` let us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone . '' 
`` It is simply this , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` I have conducted hither a prisoner , who the king commands shall not be seen . 
You came here , he has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window ; I was at dinner with the governor , I saw the object thrown , and I saw Raoul pick it up . 
It does not take long to understand this . 
I understood it , and I thought you in intelligence with my prisoner . 
And then - '' `` And then - you commanded us to be shot . '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I admit it ; but , if I was the first to seize a musket , fortunately , I was the last to take aim at you . '' 
`` If you had killed me , D'Artagnan , I should have had the good fortune to die for the royal house of France , and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you , its noblest and most loyal defender . '' 
`` What the devil , Athos , do you mean by the royal house ? '' 
stammered D'Artagnan . 
`` You do n't mean that you , a well-informed and sensible man , can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot ? '' 
`` I do believe in it . '' 
`` With so much the more reason , my dear chevalier , from your having orders to kill all those who do believe in it , '' said Raoul . 
`` That is because , '' replied the captain of the musketeers - `` because every calumny , however absurd it may be , has the almost certain chance of becoming popular . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , '' replied Athos , promptly ; `` but because the king is not willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people , and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` Do not talk in such a childish manner , Athos , or I shall begin to think you have lost your senses . 
Besides , explain to me how it is possible Louis XIII . 
should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite . '' 
`` A son whom you have brought hither masked , in a fishing-boat , '' said Athos . 
`` Why not ? '' 
D'Artagnan was brought to a pause . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he ; `` whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ? '' 
`` Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite 's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur . 
Oh ! 
I am acquainted with all that , '' resumed the comte .
