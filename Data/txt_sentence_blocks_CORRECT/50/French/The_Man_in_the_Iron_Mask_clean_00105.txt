Raoul redeemed nothing but his weakness , and only confessed his grief . 
Thus passed away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had so violently shaken the indomitable pride of the king . 
Never , when conversing with his son , did he make any allusion to that scene ; never did he give him the details of that vigorous lecture , which might , perhaps , have consoled the young man , by showing him his rival humbled . 
Athos did not wish that the offended lover should forget the respect due to his king . 
And when Bragelonne , ardent , angry , and melancholy , spoke with contempt of royal words , of the equivocal faith which certain madmen draw from promises that emanate from thrones , when , passing over two centuries , with that rapidity of a bird that traverses a narrow strait to go from one continent to the other , Raoul ventured to predict the time in which kings would be esteemed as less than other men , Athos said to him , in his serene , persuasive voice , `` You are right , Raoul ; all that you say will happen ; kings will lose their privileges , as stars which have survived their aeons lose their splendor . 
But when that moment comes , Raoul , we shall be dead . 
And remember well what I say to you . 
In this world , all , men , women , and kings , must live for the present . 
We can only live for the future for God . '' 
This was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were , as usual , conversing , and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park , when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the hour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor , was rung ; and , without attaching any importance to it , he turned towards the house with his son ; and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence of Aramis and Porthos . 
: The Last Adieux . 
Raoul uttered a cry , and affectionately embraced Porthos . 
Aramis and Athos embraced like old men ; and this embrace itself being a question for Aramis , he immediately said , `` My friend , we have not long to remain with you . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the comte . 
`` Only time to tell you of my good fortune , '' interrupted Porthos . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Raoul . 
Athos looked silently at Aramis , whose somber air had already appeared to him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted . 
`` What is the good fortune that has happened to you ? 
Let us hear it , '' said Raoul , with a smile . 
`` The king has made me a duke , '' said the worthy Porthos , with an air of mystery , in the ear of the young man , `` a duke by brevet . '' 
But the asides of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by everybody . 
His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring . 
Athos heard him , and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start . 
The latter took Athos by the arm , and , after having asked Porthos 's permission to say a word to his friend in private , `` My dear Athos , '' he began , `` you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble . '' 
`` With grief and trouble , my dear friend ? '' 
cried the comte ; `` oh , what ? '' 
`` In two words . 
I have conspired against the king ; that conspiracy has failed , and , at this moment , I am doubtless pursued . '' 
`` You are pursued ! 
- a conspiracy ! 
Eh ! 
my friend , what do you tell me ? '' 
`` The saddest truth . 
I am entirely ruined . '' 
`` Well , but Porthos - this title of duke - what does all that mean ? '' 
`` That is the subject of my severest pain ; that is the deepest of my wounds . 
I have , believing in infallible success , drawn Porthos into my conspiracy . 
He threw himself into it , as you know he would do , with all his strength , without knowing what he was about ; and now he is as much compromised as myself - as completely ruined as I am . '' 
`` Good God ! '' 
And Athos turned towards Porthos , who was smiling complacently . 
`` I must make you acquainted with the whole . 
Listen to me , '' continued Aramis ; and he related the history as we know it . 
Athos , during the recital , several times felt the sweat break from his forehead . 
`` It was a great idea , '' said he , `` but a great error . '' 
`` For which I am punished , Athos . '' 
`` Therefore , I will not tell you my entire thought . '' 
`` Tell it , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is a crime . ''
