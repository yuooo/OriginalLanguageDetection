`` But it is only a mile from here , '' said one of the passengers . 
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . '' 
`` And ca n't we cross that in a boat ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` That 's impossible . 
The creek is swelled by the rains . 
It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . '' 
The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor ; and Passepartout , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him . 
Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his master 's banknotes could not remove . 
There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow . 
They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game . 
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true Yankee , named Forster called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . '' 
`` On the bridge ? '' 
asked a passenger . 
`` On the bridge . '' 
`` With our train ? '' 
`` With our train . '' 
Passepartout stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer . 
`` But the bridge is unsafe , '' urged the conductor . 
`` No matter , '' replied Forster ; `` I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
muttered Passepartout . 
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one . 
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind . 
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one . 
`` Eighty ! 
ninety ! '' 
Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American . 
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people ! 
Sir , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! '' 
replied the passenger , turning his back on him . 
`` I know it , '' said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . '' 
`` Doubtless , '' urged Passepartout , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What ! 
Prudent ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . 
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! '' 
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated Passepartout ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who ! 
What ! 
What 's the matter with this fellow ? '' 
cried several . 
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself . 
`` Are you afraid ? '' 
asked Colonel Proctor . 
`` I afraid ? 
Very well ; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they ! '' 
`` All aboard ! '' 
cried the conductor . 
`` Yes , all aboard ! '' 
repeated Passepartout , and immediately . 
`` But they ca n't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after ! ''
