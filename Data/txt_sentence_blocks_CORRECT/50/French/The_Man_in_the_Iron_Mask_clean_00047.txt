`` Yes ; I can well say ` my friend . ' '' 
`` He who escorted La Valliere to Le Chaillot ; he who delivered up Monk , cooped in an iron box , to Charles II. ; he who so faithfully served my mother ; he to whom the crown of France owes so much that it owes everything . 
Do you intend to ask me to exile him also ? '' 
`` Never , sire . 
D'Artagnan is a man to whom , at a certain given time , I will undertake to reveal everything ; but be on your guard with him , for if he discovers our plot before it is revealed to him , you or I will certainly be killed or taken . 
He is a bold and enterprising man . '' 
`` I will think it over . 
Now tell me about M. Fouquet ; what do you wish to be done with regard to him ? '' 
`` One moment more , I entreat you , monseigneur ; and forgive me , if I seem to fail in respect to questioning you further . '' 
`` It is your duty to do so , nay , more than that , your right . '' 
`` Before we pass to M. Fouquet , I should very much regret forgetting another friend of mine . '' 
`` M. du Vallon , the Hercules of France , you mean ; oh ! 
as far as he is concerned , his interests are more than safe . '' 
`` No ; it is not he whom I intended to refer to . '' 
`` The Comte de la Fere , then ? '' 
`` And his son , the son of all four of us . '' 
`` That poor boy who is dying of love for La Valliere , whom my brother so disloyally bereft him of ? 
Be easy on that score . 
I shall know how to rehabilitate his happiness . 
Tell me only one thing , Monsieur d'Herblay ; do men , when they love , forget the treachery that has been shown them ? 
Can a man ever forgive the woman who has betrayed him ? 
Is that a French custom , or is it one of the laws of the human heart ? '' 
`` A man who loves deeply , as deeply as Raoul loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere , finishes by forgetting the fault or crime of the woman he loves ; but I do not yet know whether Raoul will be able to forget . '' 
`` I will see after that . 
Have you anything further to say about your friend ? '' 
`` No ; that is all . '' 
`` Well , then , now for M. Fouquet . 
What do you wish me to do for him ? '' 
`` To keep him on as surintendant , in the capacity in which he has hitherto acted , I entreat you . '' 
`` Be it so ; but he is the first minister at present . '' 
`` Not quite so . '' 
`` A king , ignorant and embarrassed as I shall be , will , as a matter of course , require a first minister of state . '' 
`` Your majesty will require a friend . '' 
`` I have only one , and that is yourself . '' 
`` You will have many others by and by , but none so devoted , none so zealous for your glory . '' 
`` You shall be my first minister of state . '' 
`` Not immediately , monseigneur , for that would give rise to too much suspicion and astonishment . '' 
`` M. de Richelieu , the first minister of my grandmother , Marie de Medici , was simply bishop of Lucon , as you are bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` I perceive that your royal highness has studied my notes to great advantage ; your amazing perspicacity overpowers me with delight . '' 
`` I am perfectly aware that M. de Richelieu , by means of the queen 's protection , soon became cardinal . '' 
`` It would be better , '' said Aramis , bowing , `` that I should not be appointed first minister until your royal highness has procured my nomination as cardinal . '' 
`` You shall be nominated before two months are past , Monsieur d'Herblay . 
But that is a matter of very trifling moment ; you would not offend me if you were to ask more than that , and you would cause me serious regret if you were to limit yourself to that . '' 
`` In that case , I have something still further to hope for , monseigneur . '' 
`` Speak ! 
speak ! '' 
`` M. Fouquet will not keep long at the head of affairs , he will soon get old . 
He is fond of pleasure , consistently , I mean , with all his labors , thanks to the youthfulness he still retains ; but this protracted youth will disappear at the approach of the first serious annoyance , or at the first illness he may experience . 
We will spare him the annoyance , because he is an agreeable and noble-hearted man ; but we can not save him from ill-health . 
So it is determined .
