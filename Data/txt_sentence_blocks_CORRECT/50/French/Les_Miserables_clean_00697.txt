Their trees are full of birds . 
I would walk with Cosette . 
It is sweet to be among living people who bid each other ` good-day , ' who call to each other in the garden . 
People see each other from early morning . 
We should each cultivate our own little corner . 
She would make me eat her strawberries . 
I would make her gather my roses . 
That would be charming . 
Only ... '' He paused and said gently : `` It is a pity . '' 
The tear did not fall , it retreated , and Jean Valjean replaced it with a smile . 
Cosette took both the old man 's hands in hers . 
`` My God ! '' 
said she , `` your hands are still colder than before . 
Are you ill ? 
Do you suffer ? '' 
`` I ? 
No , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` I am very well . 
Only ... '' He paused . 
`` Only what ? '' 
`` I am going to die presently . '' 
Cosette and Marius shuddered . 
`` To die ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
`` Yes , but that is nothing , '' said Jean Valjean . 
He took breath , smiled and resumed : `` Cosette , thou wert talking to me , go on , so thy little robin red-breast is dead ? 
Speak , so that I may hear thy voice . '' 
Marius gazed at the old man in amazement . 
Cosette uttered a heartrending cry . 
`` Father ! 
my father ! 
you will live . 
You are going to live . 
I insist upon your living , do you hear ? '' 
Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , forbid me to die . 
Who knows ? 
Perhaps I shall obey . 
I was on the verge of dying when you came . 
That stopped me , it seemed to me that I was born again . '' 
`` You are full of strength and life , '' cried Marius . 
`` Do you imagine that a person can die like this ? 
You have had sorrow , you shall have no more . 
It is I who ask your forgiveness , and on my knees ! 
You are going to live , and to live with us , and to live a long time . 
We take possession of you once more . 
There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness . '' 
`` You see , '' resumed Cosette , all bathed in tears , `` that Marius says that you shall not die . '' 
Jean Valjean continued to smile .
