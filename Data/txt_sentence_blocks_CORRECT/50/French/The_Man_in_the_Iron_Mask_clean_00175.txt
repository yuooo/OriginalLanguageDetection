The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole , when half-way up . 
His companions imitated him . 
`` Make your men draw back , '' cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis ; `` let them retire out of hearing . '' 
This order , given by Porthos , was executed immediately . 
Then D'Artagnan , turning towards him who followed him : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we are no longer on board the king 's fleet , where , in virtue of your order , you spoke so arrogantly to me , just now . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the officer , `` I did not speak arrogantly to you ; I simply , but rigorously , obeyed instructions . 
I was commanded to follow you . 
I follow you . 
I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do ; I am in duty bound , accordingly , to overhear your conversations . '' 
D'Artagnan trembled with rage , and Porthos and Aramis , who heard this dialogue , trembled likewise , but with uneasiness and fear . 
D'Artagnan , biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him exasperation , closely to be followed by an explosion , approached the officer . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , so much the more impressive , that , affecting calm , it threatened tempest - `` monsieur , when I sent a canoe hither , you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle . 
You produced an order to that effect ; and , in my turn , I instantly showed you the note I had written . 
When the skipper of the boat sent by me returned , when I received the reply of these two gentlemen '' -LRB- and he pointed to Aramis and Porthos -RRB- , `` you heard every word of what the messenger said . 
All that was plainly in your orders , all that was well executed , very punctually , was it not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' stammered the officer ; `` yes , without doubt , but - '' `` Monsieur , '' continued D'Artagnan , growing warm - `` monsieur , when I manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle , you demanded to accompany me ; I did not hesitate ; I brought you with me . 
You are now at Belle-Isle , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; but - '' `` But - the question no longer is of M. Colbert , who has given you that order , or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions ; the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d'Artagnan , and who is alone with M. d'Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet of salt water ; a bad position for that man , a bad position , monsieur ! 
I warn you . '' 
`` But , monsieur , if I am a restraint upon you , '' said the officer , timidly , and almost faintly , `` it is my duty which - '' `` Monsieur , you have had the misfortune , either you or those that sent you , to insult me . 
It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water . 
Oh ! 
it will happen ! 
it will happen ! 
I have only been six times angry in my life , monsieur , and all five preceding times I killed my man . '' 
The officer did not stir ; he became pale under this terrible threat , but replied with simplicity , `` Monsieur , you are wrong in acting against my orders . '' 
Porthos and Aramis , mute and trembling at the top of the parapet , cried to the musketeer , `` Good D'Artagnan , take care ! '' 
D'Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence , raised his foot with ominous calmness to mount the stair , and turned round , sword in hand , to see if the officer followed him . 
The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped up . 
Porthos and Aramis , who knew their D'Artagnan , uttered a cry , and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard . 
But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand , - `` Monsieur , '' said he to the officer , in an agitated voice , `` you are a brave man . 
You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you now . '' 
`` Speak , Monsieur d'Artagnan , speak , '' replied the officer . 
`` These gentlemen we have just seen , and against whom you have orders , are my friends . '' 
`` I know they are , monsieur . '' 
`` You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions prescribe . '' 
`` I understand your reserve . '' 
`` Very well ; permit me , then , to converse with them without a witness . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , if I yield to your request , if I do that which you beg me , I break my word ; but if I do not do it , I disoblige you . 
I prefer the one dilemma to the other . 
Converse with your friends , and do not despise me , monsieur , for doing this for your sake , whom I esteem and honor ; do not despise me for committing for you , and you alone , an unworthy act . '' 
D'Artagnan , much agitated , threw his arm round the neck of the young man , and then went up to his friends . 
The officer , enveloped in his cloak , sat down on the damp , weed-covered steps . 
`` Well ! '' 
said D'Artagnan to his friends , `` such is my position , judge for yourselves . '' 
All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth . 
`` What is the meaning of all these preparations ? '' 
said Porthos .
