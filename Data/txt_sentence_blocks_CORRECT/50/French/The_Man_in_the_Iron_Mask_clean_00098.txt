`` I did not say that to humiliate you , Heaven knows , monsieur , '' he replied . 
`` Only you are addressing yourself to me in order to obtain a pardon , and I answer according to my conscience . 
And so , judging by my conscience , the criminals we speak of are not worthy of consideration or forgiveness . '' 
Fouquet was silent . 
`` What I do is as generous , '' added the king , `` as what you have done , for I am in your power . 
I will even say it is more generous , inasmuch as you place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty , my life , may depend ; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both . '' 
`` I was wrong , certainly , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Yes , - I had the appearance of extorting a favor ; I regret it , and entreat your majesty 's forgiveness . '' 
`` And you are forgiven , my dear Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , with a smile , which restored the serene expression of his features , which so many circumstances had altered since the preceding evening . 
`` I have my own forgiveness , '' replied the minister , with some degree of persistence ; `` but M. d'Herblay , and M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` They will never obtain theirs , as long as I live , '' replied the inflexible king . 
`` Do me the kindness not to speak of it again . '' 
`` Your majesty shall be obeyed . '' 
`` And you will bear me no ill-will for it ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , sire ; for I anticipated the event . '' 
`` You had ` anticipated ' that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen ? '' 
`` Certainly ; and all my measures were taken in consequence . '' 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
cried the king , surprised . 
`` M. d'Herblay came , as may be said , to deliver himself into my hands . 
M. d'Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country . 
I could not condemn M. d'Herblay to death ; nor could I , on the other hand , expose him to your majesty 's justifiable wrath ; it would have been just the same as if I had killed him myself . '' 
`` Well ! 
and what have you done ? '' 
`` Sire , I gave M. d'Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours ' start over all those your majesty might , probably , dispatch after him . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` But still , the world is wide enough and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses , notwithstanding the ` four hours ' start ' which you have given to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` In giving him these four hours , sire , I knew I was giving him his life , and he will save his life . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
`` After having galloped as hard as possible , with the four hours ' start , before your musketeers , he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle , where I have given him a safe asylum . '' 
`` That may be ! 
But you forget that you have made me a present of Belle - Isle . '' 
`` But not for you to arrest my friends . '' 
`` You take it back again , then ? '' 
`` As far as that goes - yes , sire . '' 
`` My musketeers shall capture it , and the affair will be at an end . '' 
`` Neither your musketeers , nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle , '' said Fouquet , coldly . 
`` Belle-Isle is impregnable . '' 
The king became perfectly livid ; a lightning flash seemed to dart from his eyes . 
Fouquet felt that he was lost , but he as not one to shrink when the voice of honor spoke loudly within him . 
He bore the king 's wrathful gaze ; the latter swallowed his rage , and after a few moments ' silence , said , `` Are we going to return to Vaux ? '' 
`` I am at your majesty 's orders , '' replied Fouquet , with a low bow ; `` but I think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes previous to appearing before your court . '' 
`` We shall pass by the Louvre , '' said the king . 
`` Come . '' 
And they left the prison , passing before Baisemeaux , who looked completely bewildered as he saw Marchiali once more leave ; and , in his helplessness , tore out the major portion of his few remaining hairs . 
It was perfectly true , however , that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner 's release , and that the king wrote beneath it , `` Seen and approved , Louis '' ; a piece of madness that Baisemeaux , incapable of putting two ideas together , acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead with his own fist . 
: The False King . 
In the meantime , usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at Vaux .
