She has cut herself breaking that pane for you ! '' 
`` So much the better ! '' 
said the man . 
`` I foresaw that . '' 
`` What ? 
So much the better ? '' 
retorted his wife . 
`` Peace ! '' 
replied the father , `` I suppress the liberty of the press . '' 
Then tearing the woman 's chemise which he was wearing , he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl 's bleeding wrist . 
That done , his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise . 
`` And the chemise too , '' said he , `` this has a good appearance . '' 
An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room . 
The outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers . 
Through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling . 
The snow promised by the Candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come . 
The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing . 
He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them . 
Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece : -- `` Now , '' said he , `` we can receive the philanthropist . '' 
THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father 's . 
`` Feel how cold I am , '' said she . 
`` Bah ! '' 
replied the father , `` I am much colder than that . '' 
The mother exclaimed impetuously : -- `` You always have something better than any one else , so you do ! 
even bad things . '' 
`` Down with you ! '' 
said the man . 
The mother , being eyed after a certain fashion , held her tongue . 
Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel . 
The elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle , with a careless air ; her younger sister continued to sob ; the mother had taken the latter 's head between her hands , and was covering it with kisses , whispering to her the while : -- `` My treasure , I entreat you , it is nothing of consequence , do n't cry , you will anger your father . '' 
`` No ! '' 
exclaimed the father , `` quite the contrary ! 
sob ! 
sob ! 
that 's right . '' 
Then turning to the elder : -- `` There now ! 
He is not coming ! 
What if he were not to come ! 
I shall have extinguished my fire , wrecked my chair , torn my shirt , and broken my pane all for nothing . '' 
`` And wounded the child ! '' 
murmured the mother . 
`` Do you know , '' went on the father , `` that it 's beastly cold in this devil 's garret ! 
What if that man should not come ! 
Oh ! 
See there , you ! 
He makes us wait ! 
He says to himself : ` Well ! 
they will wait for me ! 
That 's what they 're there for . ' 
Oh !
