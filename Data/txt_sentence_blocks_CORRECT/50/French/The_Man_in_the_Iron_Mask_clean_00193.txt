`` Tell me what ? '' 
`` These people are coming down into the grotto . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` We could kill about fifteen of them , but no more . '' 
`` How many are there in all ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men . '' 
`` Seventy-five and five , eighty . 
Ah ! '' 
sighed Porthos . 
`` If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls . '' 
`` Certainly they will . '' 
`` Without reckoning , '' added Aramis , `` that the detonation might occasion a collapse of the cavern . '' 
`` Ay , '' said Porthos , `` a piece of falling rock just now grazed my shoulder . '' 
`` You see , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is nothing . '' 
`` We must determine upon something quickly . 
Our Bretons are going to continue to roll the canoe towards the sea . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
`` We two will keep the powder , the balls , and the muskets here . '' 
`` But only two , my dear Aramis - we shall never fire three shots together , '' said Porthos , innocently , `` the defense by musketry is a bad one . '' 
`` Find a better , then . '' 
`` I have found one , '' said the giant , eagerly ; `` I will place myself in ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar , and invisible , unattackable , if they come in floods , I can let my bar fall upon their skulls , thirty times in a minute . 
Hein ! 
what do you think of the project ? 
You smile ! '' 
`` Excellent , dear friend , perfect ! 
I approve it greatly ; only you will frighten them , and half of them will remain outside to take us by famine . 
What we want , my good friend , is the entire destruction of the troop . 
A single survivor encompasses our ruin . '' 
`` You are right , my friend , but how can we attract them , pray ? '' 
`` By not stirring , my good Porthos . '' 
`` Well ! 
we wo n't stir , then ; but when they are all together - '' `` Then leave it to me , I have an idea . '' 
`` If it is so , and your idea proves a good one - and your idea is most likely to be good - I am satisfied . '' 
`` To your ambuscade , Porthos , and count how many enter . '' 
`` But you , what will you do ? '' 
`` Do n't trouble yourself about me ; I have a task to perform . '' 
`` I think I hear shouts . '' 
`` It is they ! 
To your post . 
Keep within reach of my voice and hand . '' 
Porthos took refuge in the second compartment , which was in darkness , absolutely black . 
Aramis glided into the third ; the giant held in his hand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight . 
Porthos handled this lever , which had been used in rolling the bark , with marvelous facility . 
During this time , the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach . 
In the further and lighter compartment , Aramis , stooping and concealed , was busy with some mysterious maneuver . 
A command was given in a loud voice . 
It was the last order of the captain commandant .
