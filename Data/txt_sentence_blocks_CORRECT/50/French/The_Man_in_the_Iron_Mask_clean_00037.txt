- urgent ! '' 
And Baisemeaux , shrugging his shoulders with an air of supreme disdain , flung the order on the table and began eating again . 
`` They are fond of these tricks ! '' 
he said , with his mouth full ; `` they seize a man , some fine day , keep him under lock and key for ten years , and write to you , ` Watch this fellow well , ' or ` Keep him very strictly . ' 
And then , as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a dangerous man , all of a sudden , without rhyme or reason they write - ` Set him at liberty , ' and actually add to their missive - ` urgent . ' 
You will own , my lord , 't is enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders ! '' 
`` What do you expect ? 
It is for them to write , '' said Aramis , `` for you to execute the order . '' 
`` Good ! 
good ! 
execute it ! 
Oh , patience ! 
You must not imagine that I am a slave . '' 
`` Gracious Heaven ! 
my very good M. Baisemeaux , who ever said so ? 
Your independence is well known . '' 
`` Thank Heaven ! '' 
`` But your goodness of heart is also known . '' 
`` Ah ! 
do n't speak of it ! '' 
`` And your obedience to your superiors . 
Once a soldier , you see , Baisemeaux , always a soldier . '' 
`` And I shall directly obey ; and to-morrow morning , at daybreak , the prisoner referred to shall be set free . '' 
`` To-morrow ? '' 
`` At dawn . '' 
`` Why not this evening , seeing that the lettre de cachet bears , both on the direction and inside , ` urgent ' ? '' 
`` Because this evening we are at supper , and our affairs are urgent , too ! '' 
`` Dear Baisemeaux , booted though I be , I feel myself a priest , and charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst . 
This unfortunate man has suffered long enough , since you have just told me that he has been your prisoner these ten years . 
Abridge his suffering . 
His good time has come ; give him the benefit quickly . 
God will repay you in Paradise with years of felicity . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` I entreat you . '' 
`` What ! 
in the very middle of our repast ? '' 
`` I implore you ; such an action is worth ten Benedicites . '' 
`` It shall be as you desire , only our supper will get cold . '' 
`` Oh ! 
never heed that . '' 
Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois , and by a very natural motion turned round towards the door . 
The order had remained on the table ; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to change the paper for another , folded in the same manner , which he drew swiftly from his pocket . 
`` Francois , '' said the governor , `` let the major come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere . '' 
Francois bowed and quitted the room , leaving the two companions alone . 
: The General of the Order . 
There was now a brief silence , during which Aramis never removed his eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment . 
The latter seemed only half decided to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper , and it was clear he was trying to invent some pretext , whether good or bad , for delay , at any rate till after dessert . 
And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at last . 
`` Eh ! 
but it is impossible ! ''
