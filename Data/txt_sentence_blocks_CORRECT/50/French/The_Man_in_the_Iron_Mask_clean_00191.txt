`` Ten are dead . 
Biscarrat is in the cavern , and we are five . '' 
`` Biscarrat is a prisoner ? '' 
`` Probably . '' 
`` No , for here he is - look . '' 
In fact , Biscarrat appeared at the opening of the grotto . 
`` He is making a sign to come on , '' said the officer . 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
cried all the troop . 
And they advanced to meet Biscarrat . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the captain , addressing Biscarrat , `` I am assured that you know who the men are in that grotto , and who make such a desperate defense . 
In the king 's name I command you to declare what you know . '' 
`` Captain , '' said Biscarrat , `` you have no need to command me . 
My word has been restored to me this very instant ; and I came in the name of these men . '' 
`` To tell me who they are ? '' 
`` To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death , unless you grant them satisfactory terms . '' 
`` How many are there of them , then ? '' 
`` There are two , '' said Biscarrat . 
`` There are two - and want to impose conditions upon us ? '' 
`` There are two , and they have already killed ten of our men . '' 
`` What sort of people are they - giants ? '' 
`` Worse than that . 
Do you remember the history of the Bastion Saint - Gervais , captain ? '' 
`` Yes ; where four musketeers held out against an army . '' 
`` Well , these are two of those same musketeers . '' 
`` And their names ? '' 
`` At that period they were called Porthos and Aramis . 
Now they are styled M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon . '' 
`` And what interest have they in all this ? '' 
`` It is they who were holding Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet . '' 
A murmur ran through the ranks of the soldiers on hearing the two words `` Porthos and Aramis . '' 
`` The musketeers ! 
the musketeers ! '' 
repeated they . 
And among all these brave men , the idea that they were going to have a struggle against two of the oldest glories of the French army , made a shiver , half enthusiasm , two-thirds terror , run through them . 
In fact , those four names - D'Artagnan , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis - were venerated among all who wore a sword ; as , in antiquity , the names of Hercules , Theseus , Castor , and Pollux were venerated . 
`` Two men - and they have killed ten in two discharges ! 
It is impossible , Monsieur Biscarrat ! '' 
`` Eh ! 
captain , '' replied the latter , `` I do not tell you that they have not with them two or three men , as the musketeers of the Bastion Saint - Gervais had two or three lackeys ; but , believe me , captain , I have seen these men , I have been taken prisoner by them - I know they themselves alone are all-sufficient to destroy an army . '' 
`` That we shall see , '' said the captain , `` and that in a moment , too . 
Gentlemen , attention ! '' 
At this reply , no one stirred , and all prepared to obey . 
Biscarrat alone risked a last attempt . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , `` be persuaded by me ; let us pass on our way . 
Those two men , those two lions you are going to attack , will defend themselves to the death . 
They have already killed ten of our men ; they will kill double the number , and end by killing themselves rather than surrender . 
What shall we gain by fighting them ? '' 
`` We shall gain the consciousness , monsieur , of not having allowed eighty of the king 's guards to retire before two rebels .
