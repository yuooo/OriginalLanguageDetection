`` Ah , goodness ! 
there are only women in this house -- many young girls . 
It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet . 
The bell gives them warning . 
When I come , they go . 
`` What house is this ? '' 
`` Come , you know well enough . '' 
`` But I do not . '' 
`` Not when you got me the place here as gardener ? '' 
`` Answer me as though I knew nothing . '' 
`` Well , then , this is the Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
Memories recurred to Jean Valjean . 
Chance , that is to say , Providence , had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old Fauchelevent , crippled by the fall from his cart , had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously . 
He repeated , as though talking to himself : -- `` The Petit-Picpus convent . '' 
`` Exactly , '' returned old Fauchelevent . 
`` But to come to the point , how the deuce did you manage to get in here , you , Father Madeleine ? 
No matter if you are a saint ; you are a man as well , and no man enters here . '' 
`` You certainly are here . '' 
`` There is no one but me . '' 
`` Still , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I must stay here . '' 
`` Ah , good God ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
Jean Valjean drew near to the old man , and said to him in a grave voice : -- `` Father Fauchelevent , I saved your life . '' 
`` I was the first to recall it , '' returned Fauchelevent . 
`` Well , you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden days . '' 
Fauchelevent took in his aged , trembling , and wrinkled hands Jean Valjean 's two robust hands , and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking . 
At length he exclaimed : -- `` Oh ! 
that would be a blessing from the good God , if I could make you some little return for that ! 
Save your life ! 
Monsieur le Maire , dispose of the old man ! '' 
A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man . 
His countenance seemed to emit a ray of light . 
`` What do you wish me to do ? '' 
he resumed . 
`` That I will explain to you . 
You have a chamber ? '' 
`` I have an isolated hovel yonder , behind the ruins of the old convent , in a corner which no one ever looks into . 
There are three rooms in it . '' 
The hut was , in fact , so well hidden behind the ruins , and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen , that Jean Valjean had not perceived it . 
`` Good , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Now I am going to ask two things of you . '' 
`` What are they , Mr. Mayor ? '' 
`` In the first place , you are not to tell any one what you know about me . 
In the second , you are not to try to find out anything more . '' 
`` As you please . 
I know that you can do nothing that is not honest , that you have always been a man after the good God 's heart . 
And then , moreover , you it was who placed me here . 
That concerns you . 
I am at your service . '' 
`` That is settled then .
