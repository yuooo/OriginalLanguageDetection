cried M. Fouquet . 
`` Ah ! 
say ` no ' at once , and I will leave the Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed his head , took the keys , and unaccompanied , except by the minister , ascended the staircase . 
The higher they advanced up the spiral staircase , the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become distinct appeals and fearful imprecations . 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` That is your Marchiali , '' said the governor ; `` this is the way these madmen scream . '' 
And he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious allusion , as far as Fouquet was concerned , than politeness . 
The latter trembled ; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that had preceded it , the king 's voice . 
He paused on the staircase , snatching the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux , who thought this new madman was going to dash out his brains with one of them . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he cried , `` M. d'Herblay did not say a word about that . '' 
`` Give me the keys at once ! '' 
cried Fouquet , tearing them from his hand . 
`` Which is the key of the door I am to open ? '' 
`` That one . '' 
A fearful cry , followed by a violent blow against the door , made the whole staircase resound with the echo . 
`` Leave this place , '' said Fouquet to Baisemeaux , in a threatening tone . 
`` I ask nothing better , '' murmured the latter , to himself . 
`` There will be a couple of madmen face to face , and the one will kill the other , I am sure . '' 
`` Go ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` If you place your foot on this staircase before I call you , remember that you shall take the place of the meanest prisoner in the Bastile . '' 
`` This job will kill me , I am sure it will , '' muttered Baisemeaux , as he withdrew with tottering steps . 
The prisoner 's cries became more and more terrible . 
When Fouquet had satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase , he inserted the key in the first lock . 
It was then that he heard the hoarse , choking voice of the king , crying out , in a frenzy of rage , `` Help , help ! 
I am the king . '' 
The key of the second door was not the same as the first , and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the bunch . 
The king , however , furious and almost mad with rage and passion , shouted at the top of his voice , `` It was M. Fouquet who brought me here . 
Help me against M. Fouquet ! 
I am the king ! 
Help the king against M. Fouquet ! '' 
These cries filled the minister 's heart with terrible emotions . 
They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the door with a part of the broken chair with which the king had armed himself . 
Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the key . 
The king was almost exhausted ; he could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted , `` Death to Fouquet ! 
death to the traitor Fouquet ! '' 
The door flew open . 
: The King 's Gratitude . 
The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they suddenly and abruptly stopped , as a mutual recognition took place , and each uttered a cry of horror . 
`` Have you come to assassinate me , monsieur ? '' 
said the king , when he recognized Fouquet . 
`` The king in this state ! '' 
murmured the minister . 
Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him ; his clothes were in tatters ; his shirt , open and torn to rags , was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms . 
Haggard , ghastly pale , his hair in disheveled masses , Louis XIV . 
presented the most perfect picture of despair , distress , anger and fear combined that could possibly be united in one figure . 
Fouquet was so touched , so affected and disturbed by it , that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears .
