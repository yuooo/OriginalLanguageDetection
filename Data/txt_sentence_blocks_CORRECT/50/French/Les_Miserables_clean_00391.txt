They pinioned the ruffians . 
This throng of men , sparely lighted by the single candle , filled the den with shadows . 
`` Handcuff them all ! '' 
shouted Javert . 
`` Come on ! '' 
cried a voice which was not the voice of a man , but of which no one would ever have said : `` It is a woman 's voice . '' 
The Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window , and it was she who had just given vent to this roar . 
The policemen and agents recoiled . 
She had thrown off her shawl . 
but retained her bonnet ; her husband , who was crouching behind her , was almost hidden under the discarded shawl , and she was shielding him with her body , as she elevated the paving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock . 
`` Beware ! '' 
she shouted . 
All crowded back towards the corridor . 
A broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret . 
The Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned , and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents : -- `` The cowards ! '' 
Javert smiled , and advanced across the open space which the Thenardier was devouring with her eyes . 
`` Do n't come near me , '' she cried , `` or I 'll crush you . '' 
`` What a grenadier ! '' 
ejaculated Javert ; `` you 've got a beard like a man , mother , but I have claws like a woman . '' 
And he continued to advance . 
The Thenardier , dishevelled and terrible , set her feet far apart , threw herself backwards , and hurled the paving-stone at Javert 's head . 
Javert ducked , the stone passed over him , struck the wall behind , knocked off a huge piece of plastering , and , rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel , now luckily almost empty , rested at Javert 's feet . 
At the same moment , Javert reached the Thenardier couple . 
One of his big hands descended on the woman 's shoulder ; the other on the husband 's head . 
`` The handcuffs ! '' 
he shouted . 
The policemen trooped in in force , and in a few seconds Javert 's order had been executed . 
The Thenardier female , overwhelmed , stared at her pinioned hands , and at those of her husband , who had dropped to the floor , and exclaimed , weeping : -- `` My daughters ! '' 
`` They are in the jug , '' said Javert . 
In the meanwhile , the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door , and were shaking him : -- He awoke , stammering : -- `` Is it all over , Jondrette ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Javert . 
The six pinioned ruffians were standing , and still preserved their spectral mien ; all three besmeared with black , all three masked . 
`` Keep on your masks , '' said Javert . 
And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II . 
at a Potsdam parade , he said to the three `` chimney-builders '' : -- `` Good day , Bigrenaille ! 
good day , Brujon ! 
good day , Deuxmilliards ! '' 
Then turning to the three masked men , he said to the man with the meat-axe : -- `` Good day , Gueulemer ! '' 
And to the man with the cudgel : -- `` Good day , Babet ! '' 
And to the ventriloquist : -- `` Your health , Claquesous . '' 
At that moment , he caught sight of the ruffians ' prisoner . 
who , ever since the entrance of the police , had not uttered a word , and had held his head down . 
`` Untie the gentleman ! '' 
said Javert , `` and let no one go out ! '' 
That said , he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table , where the candle and the writing-materials still remained , drew a stamped paper from his pocket , and began to prepare his report . 
When he had written the first lines , which are formulas that never vary , he raised his eyes : -- `` Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward . '' 
The policemen glanced round them . 
`` Well , '' said Javert , `` where is he ? '' 
The prisoner of the ruffians , M. Leblanc , M. Urbain Fabre , the father of Ursule or the Lark , had disappeared . 
The door was guarded , but the window was not .
