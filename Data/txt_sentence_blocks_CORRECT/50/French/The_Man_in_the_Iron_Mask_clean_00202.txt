`` Nonsense ! 
It is of no use being over-delicate with me ; that is all labor lost . 
Tell me at once you are come to arrest me . '' 
`` To arrest you ? 
- Good heavens ! 
no . '' 
`` Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels , then ? '' 
`` I am making my round . '' 
`` That is n't bad ! 
And so you pick me up in your round , eh ? '' 
`` I do n't pick you up ; I meet with you , and I beg you to come with me . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` To the king . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a bantering air ; `` the king is disengaged . '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , captain , '' said M. de Gesvres , in a low voice to the musketeer , `` do not compromise yourself ! 
these men hear you . '' 
D'Artagnan laughed aloud , and replied : `` March ! 
People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards and the six last . '' 
`` But as I am not arresting you , '' said M. de Gesvres , `` you will march behind , with me , if you please . '' 
`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is very polite , duke , and you are right in being so ; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your chambre-de - ville , I should have been courteous to you , I assure you , on the word of a gentleman ! 
Now , one favor more ; what does the king want with me ? '' 
`` Oh , the king is furious ! '' 
`` Very well ! 
the king , who has thought it worth while to be angry , may take the trouble to grow calm again ; that is all . 
I sha n't die of that , I will swear . '' 
`` No , but - '' `` But - I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet . 
Mordioux ! 
That is a gallant man , a worthy man ! 
We shall live very sociably together , I will be sworn . '' 
`` Here we are at our place of destination , '' said the duke . 
`` Captain , for Heaven 's sake be calm with the king ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! 
you are playing the brave man with me , duke ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres . 
`` I have been told that you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers . 
This strikes me as a splendid opportunity . '' 
`` I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it , captain . '' 
`` And why not , pray ? '' 
`` Oh , for many reasons - in the first place , for this : if I were to succeed you in the musketeers after having arrested you - '' `` Ah ! 
then you admit you have arrested me ? '' 
`` No , I do n't . '' 
`` Say met me , then . 
So , you were saying if you were to succeed me after having arrested me ? '' 
`` Your musketeers , at the first exercise with ball cartridges , would fire my way , by mistake . '' 
`` Oh , as to that I wo n't say ; for the fellows do love me a little . '' 
Gesvres made D'Artagnan pass in first , and took him straight to the cabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers , and placed himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber . 
The king could be heard distinctly , speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where Colbert might have heard , a few days before , the king speaking aloud with M. d'Artagnan . 
The guards remained as a mounted picket before the principal gate ; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city that monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order of the king .
