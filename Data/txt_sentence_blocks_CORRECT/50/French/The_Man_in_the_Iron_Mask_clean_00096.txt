`` Because their chief - the very soul of the enterprise - having been unmasked by me , the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried . '' 
`` You have unmasked this false prince also ? '' 
`` No , I have not seen him . '' 
`` Whom have you seen , then ? '' 
`` The leader of the enterprise , not that unhappy young man ; the latter is merely an instrument , destined through his whole life to wretchedness , I plainly perceive . '' 
`` Most certainly . '' 
`` It is M. l'Abbe d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes . '' 
`` Your friend ? '' 
`` He was my friend , sire , '' replied Fouquet , nobly . 
`` An unfortunate circumstance for you , '' said the king , in a less generous tone of voice . 
`` Such friendships , sire , had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I was ignorant of the crime . '' 
`` You should have foreseen it . '' 
`` If I am guilty , I place myself in your majesty 's hands . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Monsieur Fouquet , it was not that I meant , '' returned the king , sorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner . 
`` Well ! 
I assure you that , notwithstanding the mask with which the villain covered his face , I had something like a vague suspicion that he was the very man . 
But with this chief of the enterprise there was a man of prodigious strength , the one who menaced me with a force almost herculean ; what is he ? '' 
`` It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon , formerly one of the musketeers . '' 
`` The friend of D'Artagnan ? 
the friend of the Comte de la Fere ? 
Ah ! '' 
exclaimed the king , as he paused at the name of the latter , `` we must not forget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de Bragelonne . '' 
`` Sire , sire , do not go too far . 
M. de la Fere is the most honorable man in France . 
Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you . '' 
`` With those whom you deliver up to me , you say ? 
Very good , for you will deliver up those who are guilty to me . '' 
`` What does your majesty understand by that ? '' 
inquired Fouquet . 
`` I understand , '' replied the king , `` that we shall soon arrive at Vaux with a large body of troops , that we will lay violent hands upon that nest of vipers , and that not a soul shall escape . '' 
`` Your majesty will put these men to death ! '' 
cried Fouquet . 
`` To the very meanest of them . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sire . '' 
`` Let us understand one another , Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , haughtily . 
`` We no longer live in times when assassination was the only and the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity . 
No , Heaven be praised ! 
I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name , and I have scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out . '' 
Fouquet turned pale . 
`` I will take the liberty of observing to your majesty , that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne . 
The august name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of the people accompanied by a smile . '' 
`` Justice must be done , however , monsieur . '' 
`` Good , sire ; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold . '' 
`` The royal blood ! 
you believe that ! '' 
cried the king with fury in his voice , stamping his foot on the ground . 
`` This double birth is an invention ; and in that invention , particularly , do I see M. d'Herblay 's crime . 
It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence , or the insult . ''
