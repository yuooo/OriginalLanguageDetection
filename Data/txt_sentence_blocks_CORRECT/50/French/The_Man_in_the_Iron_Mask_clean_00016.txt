`` From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors , and to have him measured instead of myself . '' 
`` A capital idea , Porthos ; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you . '' 
`` Exactly ! 
They measured him down to the ground , and the end of the skirt came just below my knee . '' 
`` What a marvelous man you are , Porthos ! 
Such a thing could happen only to you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; pay your compliments ; you have ample grounds to go upon . 
It was exactly at that time - that is to say , nearly two years and a half ago - that I set out for Belle-Isle , instructing Mouston -LRB- so as always to have , in every event , a pattern of every fashion -RRB- to have a coat made for himself every month . '' 
`` And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions ? 
Ah ! 
that was anything but right , Mouston . '' 
`` No , monsieur , quite the contrary ; quite the contrary ! '' 
`` No , he never forgot to have his coats made ; but he forgot to inform me that he had got stouter ! '' 
`` But it was not my fault , monsieur ! 
your tailor never told me . '' 
`` And this to such an extent , monsieur , '' continued Porthos , `` that the fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth , and so my last dozen coats are all too large , from a foot to a foot and a half . '' 
`` But the rest ; those which were made when you were of the same size ? '' 
`` They are no longer the fashion , my dear friend . 
Were I to put them on , I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam ; and as though I had been two years away from court . '' 
`` I understand your difficulty . 
You have how many new suits ? 
nine ? 
thirty - six ? 
and yet not one to wear . 
Well , you must have a thirty-seventh made , and give the thirty-six to Mouston . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
said Mouston , with a gratified air . 
`` The truth is , that monsieur has always been very generous to me . '' 
`` Do you mean to insinuate that I had n't that idea , or that I was deterred by the expense ? 
But it wants only two days to the fete ; I received the invitation yesterday ; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe , and only this morning discovered my misfortune ; and from now till the day after to - morrow , there is n't a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit . '' 
`` That is to say , one covered all over with gold , is n't it ? '' 
`` I wish it so ! 
undoubtedly , all over . '' 
`` Oh , we shall manage it . 
You wo n't leave for three days . 
The invitations are for Wednesday , and this is only Sunday morning . '' '' 
'T is true ; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours beforehand . '' 
`` How , Aramis ? '' 
`` Yes , it was Aramis who brought me the invitation . '' 
`` Ah ! 
to be sure , I see . 
You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` By no means ! 
by the king , dear friend . 
The letter bears the following as large as life : 'M . 
le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list - ' '' `` Very good ; but you leave with M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` And when I think , '' cried Porthos , stamping on the floor , `` when I think I shall have no clothes , I am ready to burst with rage ! 
I should like to strangle somebody or smash something ! ''
