in order to arrest this haughty , arrogant Titan who , true to his menace , threatens to scale my heaven . '' 
`` Arrest M. Fouquet , do you say ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
does that surprise you ? '' 
`` In his own house ! '' 
`` Why not ? 
If he be guilty , he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere else . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign . '' 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , it seems as if you were defending this traitor . '' 
Colbert began to chuckle silently . 
The king turned round at the sound of this suppressed mirth . 
`` Sire , '' said La Valliere , `` it is not M. Fouquet I am defending ; it is yourself . '' 
`` Me ! 
you are defending me ? '' 
`` Sire , you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order . '' 
`` Dishonor myself ! '' 
murmured the king , turning pale with anger . 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , you show a strange persistence in what you say . '' 
`` If I do , sire , my only motive is that of serving your majesty , '' replied the noble-hearted girl : `` for that I would risk , I would sacrifice my very life , without the least reserve . '' 
Colbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain . 
La Valliere , that timid , gentle lamb , turned round upon him , and with a glance like lightning imposed silence upon him . 
`` Monsieur , '' she said , `` when the king acts well , whether , in doing so , he does either myself or those who belong to me an injury , I have nothing to say ; but were the king to confer a benefit either upon me or mine , and if he acted badly , I should tell him so . '' 
`` But it appears to me , mademoiselle , '' Colbert ventured to say , `` that I too love the king . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , we both love him , but each in a different manner , '' replied La Valliere , with such an accent that the heart of the young king was powerfully affected by it . 
`` I love him so deeply , that the whole world is aware of it ; so purely , that the king himself does not doubt my affection . 
He is my king and my master ; I am the least of all his servants . 
But whoso touches his honor assails my life . 
Therefore , I repeat , that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet under his own roof . '' 
Colbert hung down his head , for he felt that the king had abandoned him . 
However , as he bent his head , he murmured , `` Mademoiselle , I have only one word to say . '' 
`` Do not say it , then , monsieur ; for I would not listen to it . 
Besides , what could you have to tell me ? 
That M. Fouquet has been guilty of certain crimes ? 
I believe he has , because the king has said so ; and , from the moment the king said , ' I think so , ' I have no occasion for other lips to say , ' I affirm it . ' 
But , were M. Fouquet the vilest of men , I should say aloud , 'M . 
Fouquet 's person is sacred to the king because he is the guest of M. Fouquet . 
Were his house a den of thieves , were Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers , his home is sacred , his palace is inviolable , since his wife is living in it ; and that is an asylum which even executioners would not dare to violate . ' '' 
La Valliere paused , and was silent . 
In spite of himself the king could not but admire her ; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her voice ; by the nobleness of the cause she advocated . 
Colbert yielded , overcome by the inequality of the struggle . 
At last the king breathed again more freely , shook his head , and held out his hand to La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he said , gently , `` why do you decide against me ? 
Do you know what this wretched fellow will do , if I give him time to breathe again ? '' 
`` Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp ? '' 
`` Should he escape , and take to flight ? '' 
exclaimed Colbert . 
`` Well , monsieur , it will always remain on record , to the king 's eternal honor , that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee ; and the more guilty he may have been , the greater will the king 's honor and glory appear , compared with such unnecessary misery and shame . '' 
Louis kissed La Valliere 's hand , as he knelt before her . 
`` I am lost , '' thought Colbert ; then suddenly his face brightened up again . 
`` Oh !
