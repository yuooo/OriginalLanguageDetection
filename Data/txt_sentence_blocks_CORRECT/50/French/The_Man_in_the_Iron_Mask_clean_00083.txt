`` No ; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` What is it , then ? '' 
`` Do you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de Mazarin contrived to steal from you ? '' 
`` Yes , of course ! '' 
`` Well , you are pronounced a public robber . '' 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
that is not all . 
Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La Valliere ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
yes . '' 
`` And that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner . '' 
`` Why should he have pardoned me , then ? '' 
`` We have not yet arrived at that part of our argument . 
I wish you to be quite convinced of the fact itself . 
Observe this well : the king knows you to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds . 
Oh ! 
of course I know that you have done nothing of the kind ; but , at all events , the king has seen the receipts , and he can do no other than believe you are incriminated . '' 
`` I beg your pardon , I do not see - '' `` You will see presently , though . 
The king , moreover , having read your love-letter to La Valliere , and the offers you there made her , can not retain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady ; you will admit that , I suppose ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Pray conclude . '' 
`` In the fewest words . 
The king , we may henceforth assume , is your powerful , implacable , and eternal enemy . '' 
`` Agreed . 
But am I , then , so powerful , that he has not dared to sacrifice me , notwithstanding his hatred , with all the means which my weakness , or my misfortunes , may have given him as a hold upon me ? '' 
`` It is clear , beyond all doubt , '' pursued Aramis , coldly , `` that the king has quarreled with you - irreconcilably . '' 
`` But , since he has absolved me - '' `` Do you believe it likely ? '' 
asked the bishop , with a searching look . 
`` Without believing in his sincerity , I believe it in the accomplished fact . '' 
Aramis slightly shrugged his shoulders . 
`` But why , then , should Louis XIV . 
have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated ? '' 
`` The king charged me with no message for you . '' 
`` With nothing ! '' 
said the superintendent , stupefied . 
`` But , that order - '' `` Oh ! 
yes . 
You are quite right . 
There is an order , certainly ; '' and these words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone , that Fouquet could not resist starting . 
`` You are concealing something from me , I see . 
What is it ? '' 
Aramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin , but said nothing . 
`` Does the king exile me ? '' 
`` Do not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when they have to try and guess where a thing has been hidden , and are informed , by a bell being rung , when they are approaching near to it , or going away from it . '' 
`` Speak , then . '' 
`` Guess . '' 
`` You alarm me . '' 
`` Bah ! 
that is because you have not guessed , then . ''
