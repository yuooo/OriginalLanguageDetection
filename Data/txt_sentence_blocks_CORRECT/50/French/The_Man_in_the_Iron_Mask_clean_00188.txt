I will accompany you , '' said one of the guards , on seeing Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern 's mouth . 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat , `` there must be something extraordinary in the place - do n't let us risk ourselves all at once . 
If in ten minutes you do not hear of me , you can come in , but not all at once . '' 
`` Be it so , '' said the young man , who , besides , did not imagine that Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise , `` we will wait for you . '' 
And without dismounting from their horses , they formed a circle round the grotto . 
Biscarrat entered then alone , and advanced through the darkness till he came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos 's musket . 
The resistance which his chest met with astonished him ; he naturally raised his hand and laid hold of the icy barrel . 
At the same instant , Yves lifted a knife against the young man , which was about to fall upon him with all force of a Breton 's arm , when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way . 
Then , like low muttering thunder , his voice growled in the darkness , `` I will not have him killed ! '' 
Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat , the one almost as terrible as the other . 
However brave the young man might be , he could not prevent a cry escaping him , which Aramis immediately suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth . 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said he , in a low voice , `` we mean you no harm , and you must know that if you have recognized us ; but , at the first word , the first groan , the first whisper , we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs . '' 
`` Yes , I recognize you , gentlemen , '' said the officer , in a low voice . 
`` But why are you here - what are you doing , here ? 
Unfortunate men ! 
I thought you were in the fort . '' 
`` And you , monsieur , you were to obtain conditions for us , I think ? '' 
`` I did all I was able , messieurs , but - '' `` But what ? '' 
`` But there are positive orders . '' 
`` To kill us ? '' 
Biscarrat made no reply . 
It would have cost him too much to speak of the cord to gentlemen . 
Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner . 
`` Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said he , `` you would be already dead if we had not regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father ; but you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your companions what you have seen . '' 
`` I will not only swear that I will not speak of it , '' said Biscarrat , `` but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto . '' 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried several voices from the outside , coming like a whirlwind into the cave . 
`` Reply , '' said Aramis . 
`` Here I am ! '' 
cried Biscarrat . 
`` Now , begone ; we depend on your loyalty . '' 
And he left his hold of the young man , who hastily returned towards the light . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the voices , still nearer . 
And the shadows of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto . 
Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them , and met them just as they were adventuring into the cave . 
Aramis and Porthos listened with the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
exclaimed one of the guards , as he came to the light , `` how pale you are ! '' 
`` Pale ! '' 
cried another ; `` you ought to say corpse-color . '' 
`` I ! '' 
said the young man , endeavoring to collect his faculties . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
what has happened ? '' 
exclaimed all the voices . 
`` You have not a drop of blood in your veins , my poor friend , '' said one of them , laughing .
