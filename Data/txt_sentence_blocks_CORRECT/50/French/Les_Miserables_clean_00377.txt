Have pity on my misery . 
I will not ask you much for it . 
How much do you think it is worth ? '' 
`` Well , '' said M. Leblanc , looking Jondrette full in the eye , and with the manner of a man who is on his guard , `` it is some signboard for a tavern , and is worth about three francs . '' 
Jondrette replied sweetly : -- `` Have you your pocket-book with you ? 
I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns . '' 
M. Leblanc sprang up , placed his back against the wall , and cast a rapid glance around the room . 
He had Jondrette on his left , on the side next the window , and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right , on the side next the door . 
The four men did not stir , and did not even seem to be looking on . 
Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone , with so vague an eye , and so lamentable an intonation , that M. Leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery . 
`` If you do not buy my picture , my dear benefactor , '' said Jondrette , `` I shall be left without resources ; there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river . 
When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade , the making of boxes for New Year 's gifts ! 
Well ! 
A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required , then a special stove is needed , a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste , according as it is to be used for wood , paper , or stuff , a paring-knife to cut the cardboard , a mould to adjust it , a hammer to nail the steels , pincers , how the devil do I know what all ? 
And all that in order to earn four sous a day ! 
And you have to work fourteen hours a day ! 
And each box passes through the workwoman 's hands thirteen times ! 
And you ca n't wet the paper ! 
And you must n't spot anything ! 
And you must keep the paste hot . 
The devil , I tell you ! 
Four sous a day ! 
How do you suppose a man is to live ? '' 
As he spoke , Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc , who was observing him . 
M. Leblanc 's eye was fixed on Jondrette , and Jondrette 's eye was fixed on the door . 
Marius ' eager attention was transferred from one to the other . 
M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself : `` Is this man an idiot ? '' 
Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times , with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order : `` There is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river ! 
I went down three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose . '' 
All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash ; the little man drew himself up and became terrible , took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder : `` That has nothing to do with the question ! 
Do you know me ? '' 
THE TRAP The door of the garret had just opened abruptly , and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses , and masked with masks of black paper . 
The first was thin , and had a long , iron-tipped cudgel ; the second , who was a sort of colossus , carried , by the middle of the handle , with the blade downward , a butcher 's pole-axe for slaughtering cattle . 
The third , a man with thick-set shoulders , not so slender as the first , held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison . 
It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been waiting for . 
A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel , the thin one . 
`` Is everything ready ? '' 
said Jondrette . 
`` Yes , '' replied the thin man . 
`` Where is Montparnasse ? '' 
`` The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl . '' 
`` Which ? '' 
`` The eldest . '' 
`` Is there a carriage at the door ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Is the team harnessed ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` With two good horses ? '' 
`` Excellent . '' 
`` Is it waiting where I ordered ? ''
