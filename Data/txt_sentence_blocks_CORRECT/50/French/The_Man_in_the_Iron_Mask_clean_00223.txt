`` Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken , monsieur le capitaine ? '' 
continued the falconer . 
`` It must be full two hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol . '' 
`` Two hundred and sixty to go , and as many to return , '' said D'Artagnan , quietly . 
`` And , '' said the falconer , `` is he well ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Why , poor M. Fouquet , '' continued the falconer , in a low voice . 
The keeper of the harriers had prudently withdrawn . 
`` No , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` the poor man frets terribly ; he can not comprehend how imprisonment can be a favor ; he says that parliament absolved him by banishing him , and banishment is , or should be , liberty . 
He can not imagine that they had sworn his death , and that to save his life from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to Heaven . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold , '' replied the falconer ; `` it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor of the Bastile , and that the execution was ordered . '' 
`` Enough ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , pensively , and with a view of cutting short the conversation . 
`` Yes , '' said the keeper of the harriers , drawing towards them , `` M. Fouquet is now at Pignerol ; he has richly deserved it . 
He had the good fortune to be conducted there by you ; he robbed the king sufficiently . '' 
D'Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks , and said to him , `` Monsieur , if any one told me you had eaten your dogs ' meat , not only would I refuse to believe it ; but still more , if you were condemned to the lash or to jail for it , I should pity you and would not allow people to speak ill of you . 
And yet , monsieur , honest man as you may be , I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was . '' 
After having undergone this sharp rebuke , the keeper of the harriers hung his head , and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of him nearer to D'Artagnan . 
`` He is content , '' said the falconer , in a low voice , to the musketeer ; `` we all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays ; if he were a falconer he would not talk in that way . '' 
D'Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political question resolved by the discontent of such humble interest . 
He for a moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant , the crumbling of his fortunes , and the melancholy death that awaited him ; and to conclude , `` Did M. Fouquet love falconry ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh , passionately , monsieur ! '' 
repeated the falconer , with an accent of bitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other to pass , and continued to advance . 
They could already catch glimpses of the huntsmen at the issue of the wood , the feathers of the outriders passing like shooting stars across the clearings , and the white horses skirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions . 
`` But , '' resumed D'Artagnan , `` will the sport last long ? 
Pray , give us a good swift bird , for I am very tired . 
Is it a heron or a swan ? '' 
`` Both , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the falconer ; `` but you need not be alarmed ; the king is not much of a sportsman ; he does not take the field on his own account , he only wishes to amuse the ladies . '' 
The words `` to amuse the ladies '' were so strongly accented they set D'Artagnan thinking . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said he , looking keenly at the falconer . 
The keeper of the harriers smiled , no doubt with a view of making it up with the musketeer . 
`` Oh ! 
you may safely laugh , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I know nothing of current news ; I only arrived yesterday , after a month 's absence . 
I left the court mourning the death of the queen-mother . 
The king was not willing to take any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria ; but everything comes to an end in this world . 
Well ! 
then he is no longer sad ? 
So much the better . '' 
-LRB- 8 -RRB- `` And everything begins as well as ends , '' said the keeper with a coarse laugh . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , a second time , - he burned to know , but dignity would not allow him to interrogate people below him , - `` there is something beginning , then , it seems ? '' 
The keeper gave him a significant wink ; but D'Artagnan was unwilling to learn anything from this man . 
`` Shall we see the king early ? '' 
asked he of the falconer . 
`` At seven o'clock , monsieur , I shall fly the birds . ''
