Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders . 
The Bishop turned to the man . 
`` Sit down , sir , and warm yourself . 
We are going to sup in a few moments , and your bed will be prepared while you are supping . '' 
At this point the man suddenly comprehended . 
The expression of his face , up to that time sombre and harsh , bore the imprint of stupefaction , of doubt , of joy , and became extraordinary . 
He began stammering like a crazy man : -- `` Really ? 
What ! 
You will keep me ? 
You do not drive me forth ? 
A convict ! 
You call me sir ! 
You do not address me as thou ? 
` Get out of here , you dog ! ' 
is what people always say to me . 
I felt sure that you would expel me , so I told you at once who I am . 
Oh , what a good woman that was who directed me hither ! 
I am going to sup ! 
A bed with a mattress and sheets , like the rest of the world ! 
a bed ! 
It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed ! 
You actually do not want me to go ! 
You are good people . 
Besides , I have money . 
I will pay well . 
Pardon me , monsieur the inn-keeper , but what is your name ? 
I will pay anything you ask . 
You are a fine man . 
You are an inn-keeper , are you not ? '' 
`` I am , '' replied the Bishop , `` a priest who lives here . '' 
`` A priest ! '' 
said the man . 
`` Oh , what a fine priest ! 
Then you are not going to demand any money of me ? 
You are the cure , are you not ? 
the cure of this big church ? 
Well ! 
I am a fool , truly ! 
I had not perceived your skull-cap . '' 
As he spoke , he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner , replaced his passport in his pocket , and seated himself . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine gazed mildly at him . 
He continued : `` You are humane , Monsieur le Cure ; you have not scorned me . 
A good priest is a very good thing . 
Then you do not require me to pay ? '' 
`` No , '' said the Bishop ; `` keep your money . 
How much have you ? 
Did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs ? '' 
`` And fifteen sous , '' added the man . 
`` One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous . 
And how long did it take you to earn that ? ''
