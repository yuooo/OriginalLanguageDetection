you would cease to love her . '' 
`` Then I am decided , my dear D'Artagnan . '' 
`` To set off to see her again ? '' 
`` No ; to set off that I may never see her again . 
I wish to love her forever . '' 
`` Ha ! 
I must confess , '' replied the musketeer , `` that is a conclusion which I was far from expecting . '' 
`` This is what I wish , my friend . 
You will see her again , and you will give her a letter which , if you think proper , will explain to her , as to yourself , what is passing in my heart . 
Read it ; I drew it up last night . 
Something told me I should see you to-day . '' 
He held the letter out , and D'Artagnan read : `` MADEMOISELLE , - You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me . 
You have only been guilty of one fault towards me , that of having left me to believe you loved me . 
This error will cost me my life . 
I pardon you , but I can not pardon myself . 
It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers . 
It will not be so with you , who did not love me , save with anxiety . 
I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love , you would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death , or lessening the esteem I had for you . 
It is much more delightful to me to die , knowing that you are free and satisfied . 
How much , then , will you love me , when you will no longer fear either my presence or reproaches ? 
You will love me , because , however charming a new love may appear to you , God has not made me in anything inferior to him you have chosen , and because my devotedness , my sacrifice , and my painful end will assure me , in your eyes , a certain superiority over him . 
I have allowed to escape , in the candid credulity of my heart , the treasure I possessed . 
Many people tell me that you loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much . 
That idea takes from my mind all bitterness , and leads me only to blame myself . 
You will accept this last farewell , and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished , and where all love endures forever . 
Adieu , mademoiselle . 
If your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood , I would shed that drop . 
I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery ! 
`` RAOUL , VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE . '' 
`` The letter reads very well , '' said the captain . 
`` I have only one fault to find with it . '' 
`` Tell me what that is ! '' 
said Raoul . 
`` Why , it is that it tells everything , except the thing which exhales , like a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart ; except the senseless love which still consumes you . '' 
Raoul grew paler , but remained silent . 
`` Why did you not write simply these words : '' ` MADEMOISELLE , - Instead of cursing you , I love you and I die . ' '' 
`` That is true , '' exclaimed Raoul , with a sinister kind of joy . 
And tearing the letter he had just taken back , he wrote the following words upon a leaf of his tablets : `` To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you , I commit the baseness of writing to you ; and to punish myself for that baseness , I die . '' 
And he signed it . 
`` You will give her these tablets , captain , will you not ? '' 
`` When ? '' 
asked the latter . 
`` On the day , '' said Bragelonne , pointing to the last sentence , `` on the day when you can place a date under these words . '' 
And he sprang away quickly to join Athos , who was returning with slow steps . 
As they re-entered the fort , the sea rose with that rapid , gusty vehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean ; the ill-humor of the element became a tempest . 
Something shapeless , and tossed about violently by the waves , appeared just off the coast . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Athos , - `` a wrecked boat ? '' 
`` No , it is not a boat , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Raoul , `` there is a bark gaining the port rapidly . ''
