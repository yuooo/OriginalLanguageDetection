There 's nothing there . '' 
`` Except the sermon , '' said Gavroche . 
`` But you , '' went on Montparnasse , `` where are you bound for now ? '' 
Gavroche pointed to his two proteges , and said : -- `` I 'm going to put these infants to bed . '' 
`` Whereabouts is the bed ? '' 
`` At my house . '' 
`` Where 's your house ? '' 
`` At my house . '' 
`` So you have a lodging ? '' 
`` Yes , I have . '' 
`` And where is your lodging ? '' 
`` In the elephant , '' said Gavroche . 
Montparnasse , though not naturally inclined to astonishment , could not restrain an exclamation . 
`` In the elephant ! '' 
`` Well , yes , in the elephant ! '' 
retorted Gavroche . 
`` Kekcaa ? '' 
This is another word of the language which no one writes , and which every one speaks . 
Kekcaa signifies : Quest que c'est que cela a ? 
-LSB- What 's the matter with that ? -RSB- 
The urchin 's profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and good sense . 
He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to Gavroche 's lodging . 
`` Of course , '' said he , `` yes , the elephant . 
Is it comfortable there ? '' 
`` Very , '' said Gavroche . 
`` It 's really bully there . 
There ai n't any draughts , as there are under the bridges . '' 
`` How do you get in ? '' 
`` Oh , I get in . '' 
`` So there is a hole ? '' 
demanded Montparnasse . 
`` Parbleu ! 
I should say so . 
But you must n't tell . 
It 's between the fore legs . 
The bobbies have n't seen it . '' 
`` And you climb up ? 
Yes , I understand . '' 
`` A turn of the hand , cric , crac , and it 's all over , no one there . '' 
After a pause , Gavroche added : -- `` I shall have a ladder for these children . '' 
Montparnasse burst out laughing : -- `` Where the devil did you pick up those young ` uns ? '' 
Gavroche replied with great simplicity : -- `` They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of . '' 
Meanwhile , Montparnasse had fallen to thinking : -- `` You recognized me very readily , '' he muttered . 
He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton , and thrust one up each of his nostrils . 
This gave him a different nose . 
`` That changes you , '' remarked Gavroche , `` you are less homely so , you ought to keep them on all the time . '' 
Montparnasse was a handsome fellow , but Gavroche was a tease . 
`` Seriously , '' demanded Montparnasse , `` how do you like me so ? '' 
The sound of his voice was different also . 
In a twinkling , Montparnasse had become unrecognizable .
