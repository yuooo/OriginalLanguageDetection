`` All that is not to be put into execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes . 
So that you see plainly , monseigneur , the order in nowise concerns you . '' 
Fouquet became thoughtful , and D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation . 
`` It is evident , by my thus confiding to you the orders which have been given to me , that I am friendly towards you , and that I am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you . '' 
`` Without doubt ! 
- without doubt ! '' 
said Fouquet , still absent . 
`` Let us recapitulate , '' said the captain , his glance beaming with earnestness . 
`` A special guard about the castle , in which your lodging is to be , is it not ? '' 
`` Do you know the castle ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment . 
He had not reached the steps of the vestibule , when Fouquet , quite beside himself , hung to the bell-rope , and shouted , `` My horses ! 
- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale . 
`` Let us be gone ! 
Let us be gone ! '' 
cried Fouquet , as soon as he saw him . 
`` It is too late ! '' 
said the surintendant 's poor friend . 
`` Too late ! 
- why ? '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the castle . 
`` What does that mean , Gourville ? '' 
`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup .
