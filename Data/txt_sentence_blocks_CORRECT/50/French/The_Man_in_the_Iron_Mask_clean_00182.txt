He was an intelligent gentleman , and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of Aramis 's wit and Porthos 's cordial bonhomie . 
`` Pardon me , '' said he , `` if I address a question to you ; but men who are in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little . '' 
`` Address it ! '' 
cried Porthos ; `` address it ! '' 
`` Speak , '' said Aramis . 
`` Were you not , gentlemen , both in the musketeers of the late king ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , and amongst the best of them , if you please , '' said Porthos . 
`` That is true ; I should say even the best of all soldiers , messieurs , if I did not fear to offend the memory of my father . '' 
`` Of your father ? '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` Do you know what my name is ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
no , monsieur ; but you can tell us , and - '' `` I am called Georges de Biscarrat . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Do you remember that name , Aramis ? '' 
`` Biscarrat ! '' 
reflected the bishop . 
`` It seems to me - '' `` Try to recollect , monsieur , '' said the officer . 
`` Pardieu ! 
that wo n't take me long , '' said Porthos . 
`` Biscarrat - called Cardinal - one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we formed our friendship with D'Artagnan , sword in hand . '' 
`` Precisely , gentlemen . '' 
`` The only one , '' cried Aramis , eagerly , `` we could not scratch . '' 
`` Consequently , a capital blade ? '' 
said the prisoner . 
`` That 's true ! 
most true ! '' 
exclaimed both friends together . 
`` Ma foi ! 
Monsieur Biscarrat , we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a brave man 's son . '' 
Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers . 
Aramis looked at Porthos as much as to say , `` Here is a man who will help us , '' and without delay , - `` Confess , monsieur , '' said he , `` that it is good to have once been a good man . '' '' 
`` My father always said so , monsieur . '' 
`` Confess , likewise , that it is a sad circumstance in which you find yourself , of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung , and to learn that these men are old acquaintances , in fact , hereditary friends . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that , messieurs and friends ! '' 
said the young man , warmly . 
`` Bah ! 
you said so yourself . '' 
`` I said so just now , when I did not know you ; but now that I know you , I say - you will evade this dismal fate , if you wish ! '' 
`` How - if we wish ? '' 
echoed Aramis , whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos . 
`` Provided , '' continued Porthos , looking , in his turn , with noble intrepidity , at M. Biscarrat and the bishop - `` provided nothing disgraceful be required of us . '' 
`` Nothing at all will be required of you , gentlemen , '' replied the officer - `` what should they ask of you ? 
If they find you they will kill you , that is a predetermined thing ; try , then , gentlemen , to prevent their finding you . '' 
`` I do n't think I am mistaken , '' said Porthos , with dignity ; `` but it appears evident to me that if they want to find us , they must come and seek us here . '' 
`` In that you are perfectly right , my worthy friend , '' replied Aramis , constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat , who had grown silent and constrained . 
`` You wish , Monsieur de Biscarrat , to say something to us , to make us some overture , and you dare not - is that true ? ''
