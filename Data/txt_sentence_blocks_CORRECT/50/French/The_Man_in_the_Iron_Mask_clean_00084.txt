`` What did the king say to you ? 
In the name of our friendship , do not deceive me . '' 
`` The king has not said one word to me . '' 
`` You are killing me with impatience , D'Herblay . 
Am I still superintendent ? '' 
`` As long as you like . '' 
`` But what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his majesty 's mind ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that 's the point . '' 
`` He does your bidding ? '' 
`` I believe so . '' 
`` It is hardly credible . '' 
`` So any one would say . '' 
`` D'Herblay , by our alliance , by our friendship , by everything you hold dearest in the world , speak openly , I implore you . 
By what means have you succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV . 
's prejudices , for he did not like you , I am certain . '' 
`` The king will like me now , '' said Aramis , laying stress upon the last word . 
`` You have something particular , then , between you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` A secret , perhaps ? '' 
`` A secret . '' 
`` A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty 's interests ? '' 
`` You are , indeed , a man of superior intelligence , monseigneur , and have made a particularly accurate guess . 
I have , in fact , discovered a secret , of a nature to change the interests of the king of France . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet , with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask any more questions . 
`` And you shall judge of it yourself , '' pursued Aramis ; `` and you shall tell me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret . '' 
`` I am listening , since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me ; only do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be indiscreet in you to communicate . '' 
Aramis seemed , for a moment , as if he were collecting himself . 
`` Do not speak ! '' 
said Fouquet : `` there is still time enough . '' 
`` Do you remember , '' said the bishop , casting down his eyes , `` the birth of Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` As if it were yesterday . '' 
`` Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth ? '' 
`` Nothing ; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` That does not matter to us , or the kingdom either ; he is the son of his father , says the French law , whose father is recognized by law . '' 
`` True ; but it is a grave matter , when the quality of races is called into question . '' 
`` A merely secondary question , after all . 
So that , in fact , you have never learned or heard anything in particular ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` That is where my secret begins . 
The queen , you must know , instead of being delivered of a son , was delivered of twins . '' 
Fouquet looked up suddenly as he replied : `` And the second is dead ? '' 
`` You will see . 
These twins seemed likely to be regarded as the pride of their mother , and the hope of France ; but the weak nature of the king , his superstitious feelings , made him apprehend a series of conflicts between two children whose rights were equal ; so he put out of the way - he suppressed - one of the twins . '' 
`` Suppressed , do you say ? '' 
`` Have patience . 
Both the children grew up ; the one on the throne , whose minister you are - the other , who is my friend , in gloom and isolation . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
What are you saying , Monsieur d'Herblay ?
