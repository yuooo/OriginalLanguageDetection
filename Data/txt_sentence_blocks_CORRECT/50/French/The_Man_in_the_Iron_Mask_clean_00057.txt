`` Yes , it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere , was it not ? '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` You are walking so heavily you will make the flooring give way . '' 
`` True , '' said the musketeer ; `` this room is above the dome , I think . '' 
`` And I did not choose it for a fencing-room , I assure you , '' added the bishop . 
`` The ceiling of the king 's room has all the lightness and calm of wholesome sleep . 
Do not forget , therefore , that my flooring is merely the covering of his ceiling . 
Good night , my friends , and in ten minutes I shall be asleep myself . '' 
And Aramis accompanied them to the door , laughing quietly all the while . 
As soon as they were outside , he bolted the door , hurriedly ; closed up the chinks of the windows , and then called out , `` Monseigneur ! 
- monseigneur ! '' 
Philippe made his appearance from the alcove , as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the bed . 
`` M. d'Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions , it seems , '' he said . 
`` Ah ! 
- you recognized M. d'Artagnan , then ? '' 
`` Before you called him by his name , even . '' 
`` He is your captain of musketeers . '' 
`` He is very devoted to me , '' replied Philippe , laying a stress upon the personal pronoun . 
`` As faithful as a dog ; but he bites sometimes . 
If D'Artagnan does not recognize you before the other has disappeared , rely upon D'Artagnan to the end of the world ; for in that case , if he has seen nothing , he will keep his fidelity . 
If he sees , when it is too late , he is a Gascon , and will never admit that he has been deceived . '' 
`` I thought so . 
What are we to do , now ? '' 
`` Sit in this folding-chair . 
I am going to push aside a portion of the flooring ; you will look through the opening , which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king 's apartment . 
Can you see ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Philippe , starting as at the sight of an enemy ; `` I see the king ! '' 
`` What is he doing ? '' 
`` He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him . '' 
`` M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` No , no ; wait a moment - '' `` Look at the notes and the portraits , my prince . '' 
`` The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert . '' 
`` Colbert sit down in the king 's presence ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis . 
`` It is impossible . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring . 
`` Yes , '' he said . 
`` Colbert himself . 
Oh , monseigneur ! 
what can we be going to hear - and what can result from this intimacy ? '' 
`` Nothing good for M. Fouquet , at all events . '' 
The prince did not deceive himself . 
We have seen that Louis XIV . 
had sent for Colbert , and Colbert had arrived . 
The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done ; it was true the king was alone with his subject . 
`` Colbert , '' said he , `` sit down . '' 
The intendant , overcome with delight , for he feared he was about to be dismissed , refused this unprecedented honor . 
`` Does he accept ? ''
