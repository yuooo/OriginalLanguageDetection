he said . 
`` I am off to Paris , when you shall have given a certain letter . '' 
`` For whom ? '' 
`` M. de Lyonne . '' 
`` And what do you want with Lyonne ? '' 
`` I wish to make him sign a lettre de cachet . '' '' 
` Lettre de cachet ! ' 
Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile ? '' 
`` On the contrary - to let somebody out . '' 
`` And who ? '' 
`` A poor devil - a youth , a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years , for two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits . '' '' 
` Two Latin verses ! ' 
and , for ` two Latin verses , ' the miserable being has been in prison for ten years ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` And has committed no other crime ? '' 
`` Beyond this , he is as innocent as you or I. '' `` On your word ? '' 
`` On my honor ! '' 
`` And his name is - '' `` Seldon . '' 
`` Yes . 
- But it is too bad . 
You knew this , and you never told me ! '' '' 
'T was only yesterday his mother applied to me , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the woman is poor ! '' 
`` In the deepest misery . '' 
`` Heaven , '' said Fouquet , `` sometimes bears with such injustice on earth , that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence . 
Stay , M. d'Herblay . '' 
And Fouquet , taking a pen , wrote a few rapid lines to his colleague Lyonne . 
Aramis took the letter and made ready to go . 
`` Wait , '' said Fouquet . 
He opened his drawer , and took out ten government notes which were there , each for a thousand francs . 
`` Stay , '' he said ; `` set the son at liberty , and give this to the mother ; but , above all , do not tell her - '' `` What , monseigneur ? '' 
`` That she is ten thousand livres richer than I . 
She would say I am but a poor superintendent ! 
Go ! 
and I pray that God will bless those who are mindful of his poor ! '' 
`` So also do I pray , '' replied Aramis , kissing Fouquet 's hand . 
And he went out quickly , carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes for Seldon 's mother , and taking up Moliere , who was beginning to lose patience . 
: Another Supper at the Bastile . 
Seven o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile , that famous clock , which , like all the accessories of the state prison , the very use of which is a torture , recalled to the prisoners ' minds the destination of every hour of their punishment . 
The time-piece of the Bastile , adorned with figures , like most of the clocks of the period , represented St. Peter in bonds . 
It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives . 
The doors , grating on their enormous hinges , opened for the passage of the baskets and trays of provisions , the abundance and the delicacy of which , as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us , was regulated by the condition in life of the prisoner . 
We understand on this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux , sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies , head cook of the royal fortress , whose trays , full-laden , were ascending the steep staircases , carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages . 
This same hour was that of M. le gouverneur 's supper also . 
He had a guest to - day , and the spit turned more heavily than usual . 
Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation .
