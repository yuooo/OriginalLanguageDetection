`` A capital crime ; I know it is . 
Lese majeste . '' 
`` Porthos ! 
poor Porthos ! '' 
`` What would you advise me to do ? 
Success , as I have told you , was certain . '' 
`` M. Fouquet is an honest man . '' 
`` And I a fool for having so ill-judged him , '' said Aramis . 
`` Oh , the wisdom of man ! 
Oh , millstone that grinds the world ! 
and which is one day stopped by a grain of sand which has fallen , no one knows how , between its wheels . '' 
`` Say by a diamond , Aramis . 
But the thing is done . 
How do you think of acting ? '' 
`` I am taking away Porthos . 
The king will never believe that that worthy man has acted innocently . 
He never can believe that Porthos has thought he was serving the king , whilst acting as he has done . 
His head would pay my fault . 
It shall not , must not , be so . '' 
`` You are taking him away , whither ? '' 
`` To Belle-Isle , at first . 
That is an impregnable place of refuge . 
Then , I have the sea , and a vessel to pass over into England , where I have many relations . '' 
`` You ? 
in England ? '' 
`` Yes , or else in Spain , where I have still more . '' 
`` But , our excellent Porthos ! 
you ruin him , for the king will confiscate all his property . '' 
`` All is provided for . 
I know how , when once in Spain , to reconcile myself with Louis XIV. , and restore Porthos to favor . '' 
`` You have credit , seemingly , Aramis ! '' 
said Athos , with a discreet air . 
`` Much ; and at the service of my friends . '' 
These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand . 
`` Thank you , '' replied the comte . 
`` And while we are on this head , '' said Aramis , `` you also are a malcontent ; you also , Raoul , have griefs to lay to the king . 
Follow our example ; pass over into Belle-Isle . 
Then we shall see , I guarantee upon my honor , that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the subject of this son of Louis XIII. , who is an Infante likewise , and whom France detains inhumanly . 
Now , as Louis XIV . 
would have no inclination for a war on that subject , I will answer for an arrangement , the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me , and a duchy in France to you , who are already a grandee of Spain . 
Will you join us ? '' 
`` No ; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with ; it is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal races . 
Doing what you propose , I should become the obliged of the king ; I should certainly be the gainer on that ground , but I should be a loser in my conscience . 
- No , thank you ! '' 
`` Then give me two things , Athos , - your absolution . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed against the oppressor . '' 
`` That is sufficient for me , '' said Aramis , with a blush which was lost in the obscurity of the night . 
`` And now , give me your two best horses to gain the second post , as I have been refused any under the pretext of the Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country . '' 
`` You shall have the two best horses , Aramis ; and again I recommend poor Porthos strongly to your care . ''
