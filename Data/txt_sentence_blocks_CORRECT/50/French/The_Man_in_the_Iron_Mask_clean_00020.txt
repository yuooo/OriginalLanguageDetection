You are making three , they tell me . '' 
`` Five , my dear sir , five . '' 
`` Three or five , 't is all the same to me , my dear monsieur ; and I know that you will make them most exquisitely . '' 
`` Yes , I know . 
Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world , I do not deny it ; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word , they must first be made ; and to do this , captain , I am pressed for time . '' 
`` Oh , bah ! 
there are two days yet ; 't is much more than you require , Monsieur Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , in the coolest possible manner . 
Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be contradicted , even in his whims ; but D'Artagnan did not pay the least attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume . 
`` My dear M. Percerin , '' he continued , `` I bring you a customer . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed Percerin , crossly . 
`` M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
Percerin attempted a bow , which found no favor in the eyes of the terrible Porthos , who , from his first entry into the room , had been regarding the tailor askance . 
`` A very good friend of mine , '' concluded D'Artagnan . 
`` I will attend to monsieur , '' said Percerin , `` but later . '' 
`` Later ? 
but when ? '' 
`` When I have time . '' 
`` You have already told my valet as much , '' broke in Porthos , discontentedly . 
`` Very likely , '' said Percerin ; `` I am nearly always pushed for time . '' 
`` My friend , '' returned Porthos , sententiously , `` there is always time to be found when one chooses to seek it . '' 
Percerin turned crimson ; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by age . 
`` Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere . '' 
`` Come , come , Percerin , '' interposed D'Artagnan , `` you are not in a good temper to-day . 
Well , I will say one more word to you , which will bring you on your knees ; monsieur is not only a friend of mine , but more , a friend of M. Fouquet 's . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , `` that is another thing . '' 
Then turning to Porthos , `` Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` I am attached to myself , '' shouted Porthos , at the very moment that the tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue . 
Moliere was all observation , D'Artagnan laughed , Porthos swore . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you will make a dress for the baron . 
'T is I who ask you . '' 
`` To you I will not say nay , captain . '' 
`` But that is not all ; you will make it for him at once . '' '' 
'T is impossible within eight days . '' 
`` That , then , is as much as to refuse , because the dress is wanted for the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` I repeat that it is impossible , '' returned the obstinate old man . 
`` By no means , dear Monsieur Percerin , above all if I ask you , '' said a mild voice at the door , a silvery voice which made D'Artagnan prick up his ears . 
It was the voice of Aramis . 
`` Monsieur d'Herblay ! '' 
cried the tailor . 
`` Aramis , '' murmured D'Artagnan . 
`` Ah ! 
our bishop ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Good morning , D'Artagnan ; good morning , Porthos ; good-morning , my dear friends , '' said Aramis . 
`` Come , come , M. Percerin , make the baron 's dress ; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet . ''
