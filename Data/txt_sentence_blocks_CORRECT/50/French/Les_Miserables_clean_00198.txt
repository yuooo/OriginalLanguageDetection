The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand . 
`` Up so early ? '' 
said Madame Thenardier ; `` is Monsieur leaving us already ? '' 
As she spoke thus , she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air , and making creases in it with her nails . 
Her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it , -- timidity and scruples . 
To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air `` of a poor wretch '' seemed difficult to her . 
The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded . 
He replied : -- `` Yes , Madame , I am going . '' 
`` So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil ? '' 
`` No , I was passing through . 
That is all . 
What do I owe you , Madame , '' he added . 
The Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill . 
The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it ; but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere . 
`` Madame , '' he resumed , `` is business good here in Montfermeil ? '' 
`` So so , Monsieur , '' replied the Thenardier , stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion . 
She continued , in a dreary and lamentable tone : -- `` Oh ! 
Monsieur , times are so hard ! 
and then , we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood ! 
All the people are poor , you see . 
If we had not , now and then , some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur , we should not get along at all . 
We have so many expenses . 
Just see , that child is costing us our very eyes . '' 
`` What child ? '' 
`` Why , the little one , you know ! 
Cosette -- the Lark , as she is called hereabouts ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the man . 
She went on : -- `` How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames ! 
She has more the air of a bat than of a lark . 
You see , sir , we do not ask charity , and we can not bestow it . 
We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal . 
The license , the imposts , the door and window tax , the hundredths ! 
Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money . 
And then , I have my daughters . 
I have no need to bring up other people 's children . '' 
The man resumed , in that voice which he strove to render indifferent , and in which there lingered a tremor : -- `` What if one were to rid you of her ? '' 
`` Who ? 
Cosette ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
The landlady 's red and violent face brightened up hideously . 
`` Ah ! 
sir , my dear sir , take her , keep her , lead her off , carry her away , sugar her , stuff her with truffles , drink her , eat her , and the blessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you ! '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
`` Really ! 
You will take her away ? '' 
`` I will take her away . '' 
`` Immediately ? '' 
`` Immediately . 
Call the child . ''
