Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form . 
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin . 
It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince . 
Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments ; these closed the procession . 
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , `` A suttee . '' 
The Parsee nodded , and put his finger to his lips . 
The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood . 
The songs gradually died away ; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again . 
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked : `` What is a suttee ? '' 
`` A suttee , '' returned the general , `` is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one . 
The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day . '' 
`` Oh , the scoundrels ! '' 
cried Passepartout , who could not repress his indignation . 
`` And the corpse ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` Is that of the prince , her husband , '' said the guide ; `` an independent rajah of Bundelcund . '' 
`` Is it possible , '' resumed Phileas Fogg , his voice betraying not the least emotion , `` that these barbarous customs still exist in India , and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them ? '' 
`` These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India , '' replied Sir Francis ; `` but we have no power over these savage territories , and especially here in Bundelcund . 
The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage . '' 
`` The poor wretch ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , `` to be burned alive ! '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Sir Francis , `` burned alive . 
And , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . 
They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . 
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . 
Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it . 
Several years ago , when I was living at Bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . 
The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose . '' 
While Sir Francis was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said : `` The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund . '' 
`` But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance , '' observed Sir Francis . 
`` That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium . '' 
`` But where are they taking her ? '' 
`` To the pagoda of Pillaji , two miles from here ; she will pass the night there . '' 
`` And the sacrifice will take place -- '' `` To-morrow , at the first light of dawn . '' 
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck . 
Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , Mr. Fogg stopped him , and , turning to Sir Francis Cromarty , said , `` Suppose we save this woman . '' 
`` Save the woman , Mr. Fogg ! '' 
`` I have yet twelve hours to spare ; I can devote them to that . '' 
`` Why , you are a man of heart ! '' 
`` Sometimes , '' replied Phileas Fogg , quietly ; `` when I have the time . '' 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE The project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable . 
Mr. Fogg was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour . 
But he did not hesitate , and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally . 
As for Passepartout , he was ready for anything that might be proposed . 
His master 's idea charmed him ; he perceived a heart , a soul , under that icy exterior . 
He began to love Phileas Fogg . 
There remained the guide : what course would he adopt ? 
Would he not take part with the Indians ?
