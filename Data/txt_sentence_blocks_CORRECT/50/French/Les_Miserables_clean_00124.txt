Stop ! '' 
He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope . 
It was the old woman 's little boy . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the latter , `` it was I who got the cart for you . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` You have not given me anything . '' 
He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , you scamp ? '' 
said he ; `` you shall have nothing . '' 
He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed . 
He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin . 
He wanted to make it good . 
The little horse was courageous , and pulled for two ; but it was the month of February , there had been rain ; the roads were bad . 
And then , it was no longer the tilbury . 
The cart was very heavy , and in addition , there were many ascents . 
He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol ; four hours for five leagues . 
At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable ; as he had promised Scaufflaire , he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating ; he thought of sad and confusing things . 
The inn-keeper 's wife came to the stable . 
`` Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast ? '' 
`` Come , that is true ; I even have a good appetite . '' 
He followed the woman , who had a rosy , cheerful face ; she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth . 
`` Make haste ! '' 
said he ; `` I must start again ; I am in a hurry . '' 
A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste ; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort . 
`` That is what ailed me , '' he thought ; `` I had not breakfasted . '' 
His breakfast was served ; he seized the bread , took a mouthful , and then slowly replaced it on the table , and did not touch it again . 
A carter was eating at another table ; he said to this man : -- `` Why is their bread so bitter here ? '' 
The carter was a German and did not understand him . 
He returned to the stable and remained near the horse . 
An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course towards Tinques , which is only five leagues from Arras . 
What did he do during this journey ? 
Of what was he thinking ? 
As in the morning , he watched the trees , the thatched roofs , the tilled fields pass by , and the way in which the landscape , broken at every turn of the road , vanished ; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul , and almost relieves it from thought . 
What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time ? 
To travel is to be born and to die at every instant ; perhaps , in the vaguest region of his mind , be did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence : all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us ; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled ; after a dazzling moment , an eclipse ; we look , we hasten , we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing ; each event is a turn in the road , and , all at once , we are old ; we feel a shock ; all is black ; we distinguish an obscure door ; the gloomy horse of life , which has been drawing us halts , and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows . 
Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques ; it is true that the days were still short ; he did not halt at Tinques ; as he emerged from the village , a laborer , who was mending the road with stones , raised his head and said to him : -- `` That horse is very much fatigued . '' 
The poor beast was , in fact , going at a walk . 
`` Are you going to Arras ? '' 
added the road-mender . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early . '' 
He stopped his horse , and asked the laborer : -- `` How far is it from here to Arras ? '' 
`` Nearly seven good leagues . '' 
`` How is that ? 
the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
returned the road-mender , `` so you do n't know that the road is under repair ? 
You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on ; there is no way to proceed further . '' 
`` Really ? ''
