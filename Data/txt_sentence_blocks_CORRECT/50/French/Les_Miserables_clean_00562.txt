He was `` an egoist . '' 
Marius , fasting , fevered , having emerged in succession from all hope , and having been stranded in grief , the most sombre of shipwrecks , and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near , had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted . 
A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that febrile absorption known to , and classified by , science , and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure . 
Despair , also , has its ecstasy . 
Marius had reached this point . 
He looked on at everything as from without ; as we have said , things which passed before him seemed far away ; he made out the whole , but did not perceive the details . 
He beheld men going and coming as through a flame . 
He heard voices speaking as at the bottom of an abyss . 
But this moved him . 
There was in this scene a point which pierced and roused even him . 
He had but one idea now , to die ; and he did not wish to be turned aside from it , but he reflected , in his gloomy somnambulism , that while destroying himself , he was not prohibited from saving some one else . 
He raised his voice . 
`` Enjolras and Combeferre are right , '' said he ; `` no unnecessary sacrifice . 
I join them , and you must make haste . 
Combeferre has said convincing things to you . 
There are some among you who have families , mothers , sisters , wives , children . 
Let such leave the ranks . '' 
No one stirred . 
`` Married men and the supporters of families , step out of the ranks ! '' 
repeated Marius . 
His authority was great . 
Enjolras was certainly the head of the barricade , but Marius was its savior . 
`` I order it , '' cried Enjolras . 
`` I entreat you , '' said Marius . 
Then , touched by Combeferre 's words , shaken by Enjolras ' order , touched by Marius ' entreaty , these heroic men began to denounce each other . 
-- `` It is true , '' said one young man to a full grown man , `` you are the father of a family . 
Go . '' 
-- `` It is your duty rather , '' retorted the man , `` you have two sisters whom you maintain . '' 
-- And an unprecedented controversy broke forth . 
Each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door of the tomb . 
`` Make haste , '' said Courfeyrac , `` in another quarter of an hour it will be too late . '' 
`` Citizens , '' pursued Enjolras , `` this is the Republic , and universal suffrage reigns . 
Do you yourselves designate those who are to go . '' 
They obeyed . 
After the expiration of a few minutes , five were unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks . 
`` There are five of them ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
There were only four uniforms . 
`` Well , '' began the five , `` one must stay behind . '' 
And then a struggle arose as to who should remain , and who should find reasons for the others not remaining . 
The generous quarrel began afresh . 
`` You have a wife who loves you . '' 
-- `` You have your aged mother . '' 
-- '' You have neither father nor mother , and what is to become of your three little brothers ? '' 
-- `` You are the father of five children . '' 
-- `` You have a right to live , you are only seventeen , it is too early for you to die . '' 
These great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism . 
The improbable was simple there . 
These men did not astonish each other . 
`` Be quick , '' repeated Courfeyrac .
