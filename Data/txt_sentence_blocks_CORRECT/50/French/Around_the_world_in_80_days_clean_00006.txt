`` Monsieur is going to leave home ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
`` We are going round the world . '' 
Passepartout opened wide his eyes , raised his eyebrows , held up his hands , and seemed about to collapse , so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment . 
`` Round the world ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` In eighty days , '' responded Mr. Fogg . 
`` So we have n't a moment to lose . '' 
`` But the trunks ? '' 
gasped Passepartout , unconsciously swaying his head from right to left . 
`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you . 
We 'll buy our clothes on the way . 
Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak , and some stout shoes , though we shall do little walking . 
Make haste ! '' 
Passepartout tried to reply , but could not . 
He went out , mounted to his own room , fell into a chair , and muttered : `` That 's good , that is ! 
And I , who wanted to remain quiet ! '' 
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure . 
Around the world in eighty days ! 
Was his master a fool ? 
No . 
Was this a joke , then ? 
They were going to Dover ; good ! 
To Calais ; good again ! 
After all , Passepartout , who had been away from France five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again . 
Perhaps they would go as far as Paris , and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more . 
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there ; no doubt -- but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto ! 
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself ; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to Mr. Fogg . 
Mr. Fogg was quite ready . 
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw 's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . 
He took the carpet-bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes , which would pass wherever he might go . 
`` You have forgotten nothing ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing , monsieur . '' 
`` My mackintosh and cloak ? '' 
`` Here they are . '' 
`` Good ! 
Take this carpet-bag , '' handing it to Passepartout . 
`` Take good care of it , for there are twenty thousand pounds in it . '' 
Passepartout nearly dropped the bag , as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold , and weighed him down . 
Master and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross . 
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight . 
Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms . 
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , `` Here , my good woman . 
I 'm glad that I met you ; '' and passed on . 
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart . 
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased , Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the Reform . 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . '' 
`` Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , Mr. Fogg , '' said Ralph politely . 
`` We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . ''
