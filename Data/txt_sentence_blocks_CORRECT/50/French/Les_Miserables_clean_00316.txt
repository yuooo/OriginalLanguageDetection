`` An independent gentleman ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` His daughter , Celestine . '' '' 
-- tine . 
What next ? '' 
`` Colonel Sainval . '' 
`` Sainval is stale . 
I should say Valsin . '' 
Beside the vaudeville aspirants , another group , which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low , was discussing a duel . 
An old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen , and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with . 
`` The deuce ! 
Look out for yourself . 
He is a fine swordsman . 
His play is neat . 
He has the attack , no wasted feints , wrist , dash , lightning , a just parade , mathematical parries , bigre ! 
and he is left-handed . '' 
In the angle opposite Grantaire , Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes , and talking of love . 
`` You are in luck , that you are , '' Joly was saying . 
`` You have a mistress who is always laughing . '' 
`` That is a fault of hers , '' returned Bahorel . 
`` One 's mistress does wrong to laugh . 
That encourages one to deceive her . 
To see her gay removes your remorse ; if you see her sad , your conscience pricks you . '' 
`` Ingrate ! 
a woman who laughs is such a good thing ! 
And you never quarrel ! ''

`` Peace is happiness digesting . '' 
`` And you , Jolllly , where do you stand in your entanglement with Mamselle -- you know whom I mean ? '' 
`` She sulks at me with cruel patience . '' 
`` Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
`` In your place , I would let her alone . '' 
`` That is easy enough to say . '' 
`` And to do . 
Is not her name Musichetta ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Ah ! 
my poor Bahorel , she is a superb girl , very literary , with tiny feet , little hands , she dresses well , and is white and dimpled , with the eyes of a fortune-teller . 
I am wild over her . '' 
`` My dear fellow , then in order to please her , you must be elegant , and produce effects with your knees . 
Buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at Staub 's . 
That will assist . '' 
`` At what price ? '' 
shouted Grantaire . 
The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion . 
Pagan mythology was giving battle to Christian mythology .
