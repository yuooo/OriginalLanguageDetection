With me , it is my sword that warns me . 
Well , it told me of nothing this morning . 
But , stay a moment - look here , it has just fallen of its own accord into the last hole of the belt . 
Do you know what that is a warning of ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well , that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very day . '' 
`` Well , '' said the surintendant , more astonished than annoyed by this frankness , `` if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your sword , I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me . '' 
`` You ! 
arrest you ! '' 
`` Of course . 
The warning - '' `` Does not concern you , since you have been arrested ever since yesterday . 
It is not you I shall have to arrest , be assured of that . 
That is the reason why I am delighted , and also the reason why I said that my day will be a happy one . '' 
And with these words , pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness of manner , the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the king . 
He was on the point of leaving the room , when Fouquet said to him , `` One last mark of kindness . '' 
`` What is it , monseigneur ? '' 
`` M. d'Herblay ; let me see Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` I am going to try and get him to come to you . '' 
D'Artagnan did not think himself so good a prophet . 
It was written that the day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been made in the morning . 
He had accordingly knocked , as we have seen , at the king 's door . 
The door opened . 
The captain thought that it was the king who had just opened it himself ; and this supposition was not altogether inadmissible , considering the state of agitation in which he had left Louis XIV . 
the previous evening ; but instead of his royal master , whom he was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect , he perceived the long , calm features of Aramis . 
So extreme was his surprise that he could hardly refrain from uttering a loud exclamation . 
`` Aramis ! '' 
he said . 
`` Good morning , dear D'Artagnan , '' replied the prelate , coldly . 
`` You here ! '' 
stammered out the musketeer . 
`` His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping , after having been greatly fatigued during the whole night . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , who could not understand how the bishop of Vannes , who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening , had become in half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune that had ever sprung up in a sovereign 's bedroom . 
In fact , to transmit the orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch 's room , to serve as an intermediary of Louis XIV . 
so as to be able to give a single order in his name at a couple paces from him , he must have become more than Richelieu had ever been to Louis XIII . 
D'Artagnan 's expressive eye , half - opened lips , his curling mustache , said as much indeed in the plainest language to the chief favorite , who remained calm and perfectly unmoved . 
`` Moreover , '' continued the bishop , `` you will be good enough , monsieur le capitaine des mousquetaires , to allow those only to pass into the king 's room this morning who have special permission . 
His majesty does not wish to be disturbed just yet . '' 
`` But , '' objected D'Artagnan , almost on the point of refusing to obey this order , and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions which the king 's silence had aroused - `` but , monsieur l'eveque , his majesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning . '' 
`` Later , later , '' said the king 's voice , from the bottom of the alcove ; a voice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer 's veins . 
He bowed , amazed , confused , and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis seemed to overwhelm him , as soon as these words had been pronounced . 
`` And then , '' continued the bishop , `` as an answer to what you were coming to ask the king , my dear D'Artagnan , here is an order of his majesty , which you will be good enough to attend to forthwith , for it concerns M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan took the order which was held out to him . 
`` To be set at liberty ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` Ah ! '' 
and he uttered a second `` ah ! '' 
still more full of intelligence than the former ; for this order explained Aramis 's presence with the king , and that Aramis , in order to have obtained Fouquet 's pardon , must have made considerable progress in the royal favor , and that this favor explained , in its tenor , the hardly conceivable assurance with which M. d'Herblay issued the order in the king 's name . 
For D'Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood something of the matter in hand to order to understand the rest . 
He bowed and withdrew a couple of paces , as though he were about to leave .
