`` I will make myself intelligible . 
In a certain arrondissement of the Pas de Calais , there was , in 1822 , a man who had fallen out with justice , and who , under the name of M. Madeleine , had regained his status and rehabilitated himself . 
This man had become a just man in the full force of the term . 
In a trade , the manufacture of black glass goods , he made the fortune of an entire city . 
As far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also , but as a secondary matter , and in some sort , by accident . 
He was the foster-father of the poor . 
He founded hospitals , opened schools , visited the sick , dowered young girls , supported widows , and adopted orphans ; he was like the guardian angel of the country . 
He refused the cross , he was appointed Mayor . 
A liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days ; he denounced him , and had him arrested , and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte , -- I have the fact from the cashier himself , -- by means of a false signature , to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine . 
This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean . 
As for the other fact , you have nothing to tell me about it either . 
Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert ; he shot him with a pistol . 
I , the person who is speaking to you , was present . '' 
Thenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory , and who has just regained , in one instant , all the ground which he has lost . 
But the smile returned instantly . 
The inferior 's triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling . 
Thenardier contented himself with saying to Marius : `` Monsieur le Baron , we are on the wrong track . '' 
And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl . 
`` What ! '' 
broke forth Marius , `` do you dispute that ? 
These are facts . '' 
`` They are chimeras . 
The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so . 
Truth and justice before all things . 
I do not like to see folks accused unjustly . 
Monsieur le Baron , Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill Javert . '' 
`` This is too much ! 
How is this ? '' 
`` For two reasons . '' 
`` What are they ? 
Speak . '' 
`` This is the first : he did not rob M. Madeleine , because it is Jean Valjean himself who was M. Madeleine . '' 
`` What tale are you telling me ? '' 
`` And this is the second : he did not assassinate Javert , because the person who killed Javert was Javert . '' 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
`` That Javert committed suicide . '' 
`` Prove it ! 
prove it ! '' 
cried Marius beside himself . 
Thenardier resumed , scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient Alexandrine measure : `` Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change . '' 
`` But prove it ! '' 
Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper , which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes . 
`` I have my papers , '' he said calmly . 
And he added : `` Monsieur le Baron , in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean thoroughly . 
I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the same man , and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert . 
If I speak , it is because I have proofs . 
Not manuscript proofs -- writing is suspicious , handwriting is complaisant , -- but printed proofs . '' 
As he spoke , Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers , yellow , faded , and strongly saturated with tobacco . 
One of these two newspapers , broken at every fold and falling into rags , seemed much older than the other . 
`` Two facts , two proofs , '' remarked Thenardier .
