Long live joy ! 
Let 's fight , crebleu ! 
I 've had enough of despotism . '' 
At that moment , the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having fallen , Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement , and picked up the man , then he assisted in raising the horse . 
After which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way . 
In the Rue de Thorigny , all was peace and silence . 
This apathy , peculiar to the Marais , presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar . 
Four gossips were chatting in a doorway . 
Scotland has trios of witches , Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags ; and the `` Thou shalt be King '' could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr . 
The croak would be almost identical . 
The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns . 
Three of them were portresses , and the fourth was a rag-picker with her basket on her back . 
All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age , which are decrepitude , decay , ruin , and sadness . 
The rag-picker was humble . 
In this open-air society , it is the rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes . 
This is caused by the corner for refuse , which is fat or lean , according to the will of the portresses , and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap . 
There may be kindness in the broom . 
This rag-picker was a grateful creature , and she smiled , with what a smile ! 
on the three portresses . 
Things of this nature were said : -- `` Ah , by the way , is your cat still cross ? '' 
`` Good gracious , cats are naturally the enemies of dogs , you know . 
It 's the dogs who complain . '' 
`` And people also . '' 
`` But the fleas from a cat do n't go after people . '' 
`` That 's not the trouble , dogs are dangerous . 
I remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers . 
That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome . 
Do you remember the King of Rome ? '' 
`` I liked the Duc de Bordeau better . '' 
`` I knew Louis XVIII . 
I prefer Louis XVIII . '' 
`` Meat is awfully dear , is n't it , Mother Patagon ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
do n't mention it , the butcher 's shop is a horror . 
A horrible horror -- one ca n't afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays . '' 
Here the rag-picker interposed : -- `` Ladies , business is dull . 
The refuse heaps are miserable . 
No one throws anything away any more . 
They eat everything . '' 
`` There are poorer people than you , la Vargouleme . '' 
`` Ah , that 's true , '' replied the rag-picker , with deference , `` I have a profession . '' 
A pause succeeded , and the rag-picker , yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man , added : -- `` In the morning , on my return home , I pick over my basket , I sort my things . 
This makes heaps in my room . 
I put the rags in a basket , the cores and stalks in a bucket , the linen in my cupboard , the woollen stuff in my commode , the old papers in the corner of the window , the things that are good to eat in my bowl , the bits of glass in my fireplace , the old shoes behind my door , and the bones under my bed . '' 
Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening . 
`` Old ladies , '' said he , `` what do you mean by talking politics ? '' 
He was assailed by a broadside , composed of a quadruple howl . 
`` Here 's another rascal . '' 
`` What 's that he 's got in his paddle ? 
A pistol ? ''
