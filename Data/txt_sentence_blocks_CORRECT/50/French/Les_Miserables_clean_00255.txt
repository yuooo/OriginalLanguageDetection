`` But she will hear . '' 
`` She will not listen . 
Besides , what the cloister knows the world learns not . '' 
A pause ensued . 
The prioress went on : -- `` You will remove your bell . 
It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit ? '' 
`` He will pay it at four o'clock to-day . 
The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung . 
But you do not understand any of the peals ? '' 
`` I pay no attention to any but my own . '' 
`` That is well , Father Fauvent . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , a lever at least six feet long will be required . '' 
`` Where will you obtain it ? '' 
`` Where gratings are not lacking , iron bars are not lacking . 
I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden . '' 
`` About three-quarters of an hour before midnight ; do not forget . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort , my brother is the strong man for you . 
A perfect Turk ! '' 
`` You will do it as speedily as possible . '' 
`` I can not work very fast . 
I am infirm ; that is why I require an assistant . 
I limp . '' 
`` To limp is no sin , and perhaps it is a blessing . 
The Emperor Henry II. , who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII. , has two surnames , the Saint and the Lame . '' 
`` Two surtouts are a good thing , '' murmured Fauchelevent , who really was a little hard of hearing . 
`` Now that I think of it , Father Fauvent , let us give a whole hour to it . 
That is not too much . 
Be near the principal altar , with your iron bar , at eleven o'clock . 
The office begins at midnight . 
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that . '' 
`` I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community . 
These are my orders . 
I am to nail up the coffin . 
At eleven o'clock exactly , I am to be in the chapel . 
The Mother Precentors will be there . 
Mother Ascension will be there . 
Two men would be better . 
However , never mind ! 
I shall have my lever . 
We will open the vault , we will lower the coffin , and we will close the vault again . 
After which , there will be no trace of anything . 
The government will have no suspicion . 
Thus all has been arranged , reverend Mother ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` What else remains ? ''
