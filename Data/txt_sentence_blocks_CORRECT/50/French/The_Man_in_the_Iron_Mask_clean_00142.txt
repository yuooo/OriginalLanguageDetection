At length , he himself re-appeared among his guests ; but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them ; from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . 
A breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out , his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . 
On seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards Fouquet . 
The latter , looking at Pelisson , leaned upon his wife , and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere . 
`` Well , '' said he , in a voice which had nothing human in it . 
`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . '' 
` LOUIS . '' 
` The present letter is to serve as a receipt . ' '' 
A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment . 
`` Well , '' cried Pelisson , in his turn , `` you have received that letter ? '' 
`` Received it , yes ! '' 
`` What will you do , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , since I have received it . '' 
`` But - '' `` If I have received it , Pelisson , I have paid it , '' said the surintendant , with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present . 
`` You have paid it ! '' 
cried Madame Fouquet . 
`` Then we are ruined ! '' 
`` Come , no useless words , '' interrupted Pelisson . 
`` Next to money , life . 
Monseigneur , to horse ! 
to horse ! '' 
`` What , leave us ! '' 
at once cried both the women , wild with grief . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , in saving yourself , you save us all . 
To horse ! '' 
`` But he can not hold himself on . 
Look at him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
if he takes time to reflect - '' said the intrepid Pelisson . 
`` He is right , '' murmured Fouquet . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Gourville , rushing up the stairs , four steps at once . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
`` I escorted , as you desired , the king 's courier with the money . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
when I arrived at the Palais Royal , I saw - '' `` Take breath , my poor friend , take breath ; you are suffocating . '' 
`` What did you see ? '' 
cried the impatient friends . 
`` I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback , '' said Gourville . 
`` There , then ! '' 
cried every voice at once ; `` there , then !
