For whom was this cabriolet ? 
Why was it driving at a walk ? 
Laigle took a survey . 
In it , beside the coachman , sat a young man , and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag . 
The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff : MARIUS PONTMERCY . 
This name caused Laigle to change his attitude . 
He drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet : -- `` Monsieur Marius Pontmercy ! '' 
The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt . 
The young man , who also seemed deeply buried in thought , raised his eyes : -- `` Hey ? '' 
said he . 
`` You are M. Marius Pontmercy ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` I was looking for you , '' resumed Laigle de Meaux . 
`` How so ? '' 
demanded Marius ; for it was he : in fact , he had just quitted his grandfather 's , and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time . 
`` I do not know you . '' 
`` Neither do I know you , '' responded Laigle . 
Marius thought he had encountered a wag , the beginning of a mystification in the open street . 
He was not in a very good humor at the moment . 
He frowned . 
Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably : -- `` You were not at the school day before yesterday . '' 
`` That is possible . '' 
`` That is certain . '' 
`` You are a student ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
`` Yes , sir . 
Like yourself . 
Day before yesterday , I entered the school , by chance . 
You know , one does have such freaks sometimes . 
The professor was just calling the roll . 
You are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions . 
At the third call , unanswered , your name is erased from the list . 
Sixty francs in the gulf . '' 
Marius began to listen . 
`` It was Blondeau who was making the call . 
You know Blondeau , he has a very pointed and very malicious nose , and he delights to scent out the absent . 
He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening , not being compromised by that letter . 
The call was not going badly . 
No erasures ; the universe was present . 
Blondeau was grieved . 
I said to myself : ` Blondeau , my love , you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution to-day . ' 
All at once Blondeau calls , ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
No one answers . 
Blondeau , filled with hope , repeats more loudly : ` Marius Pontmercy ! ' 
And he takes his pen . 
Monsieur , I have bowels of compassion . 
I said to myself hastily : ` Here 's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out . 
Attention . 
Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact . 
He 's not a good student .
