You have not replaced her . 
Why ? '' 
`` Nicolette suffices . '' 
`` But you ought to have a maid . '' 
`` Have I not Marius ? '' 
`` You ought to have a house of your own , your own servants , a carriage , a box at the theatre . 
There is nothing too fine for you . 
Why not profit by your riches ? 
Wealth adds to happiness . '' 
Cosette made no reply . 
Jean Valjean 's visits were not abridged . 
Far from it . 
When it is the heart which is slipping , one does not halt on the downward slope . 
When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour , he sang the praises of Marius ; he pronounced him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good . 
Cosette outdid him . 
Jean Valjean began again . 
They were never weary . 
Marius -- that word was inexhaustible ; those six letters contained volumes . 
In this manner , Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time . 
It was so sweet to see Cosette , to forget by her side ! 
It alleviated his wounds . 
It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce : `` M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served . '' 
On those days , Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home . 
Was there , then , any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of Marius ? 
Was Jean Valjean really a chrysalis who would persist , and who would come to visit his butterfly ? 
One day he remained still longer than usual . 
On the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth . 
-- `` Hello ! '' 
he thought . 
`` No fire . '' 
-- And he furnished the explanation for himself . 
-- `` It is perfectly simple . 
It is April . 
The cold weather has ceased . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how cold it is here ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette when she entered . 
`` Why , no , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then ? '' 
`` Yes , since we are now in the month of May . '' 
`` But we have a fire until June . 
One is needed all the year in this cellar . '' 
`` I thought that a fire was unnecessary . '' 
`` That is exactly like one of your ideas ! '' 
retorted Cosette . 
On the following day there was a fire . 
But the two arm-chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door . '' 
-- What is the meaning of this ? '' 
thought Jean Valjean . 
He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth .
