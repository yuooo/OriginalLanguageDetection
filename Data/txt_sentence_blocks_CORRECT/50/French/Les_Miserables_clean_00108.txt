He showed it to the Fleming . 
The figures were 5 , 6 , 8Â 1/2 . 
`` You see , '' he said , `` total , nineteen and a half ; as well say twenty leagues . '' 
`` Mr. Mayor , '' returned the Fleming , `` I have just what you want . 
My little white horse -- you may have seen him pass occasionally ; he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais . 
He is full of fire . 
They wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first . 
Bah ! 
He reared , he kicked , he laid everybody flat on the ground . 
He was thought to be vicious , and no one knew what to do with him . 
I bought him . 
I harnessed him to a carriage . 
That is what he wanted , sir ; he is as gentle as a girl ; he goes like the wind . 
Ah ! 
indeed he must not be mounted . 
It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse . 
Every one has his ambition . 
` Draw ? 
Yes . 
Carry ? 
No . ' 
We must suppose that is what he said to himself . '' 
`` And he will accomplish the trip ? '' 
`` Your twenty leagues all at a full trot , and in less than eight hours . 
But here are the conditions . '' 
`` State them . '' 
`` In the first place . 
you will give him half an hour 's breathing spell midway of the road ; he will eat ; and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats ; for I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses . '' 
`` Some one will be by . '' 
`` In the second place -- is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage , in order not to overload the horse ? '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
`` But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him , he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen . '' 
`` That is understood . '' 
`` I am to have thirty francs a day . 
The days of rest to be paid for also -- not a farthing less ; and the beast 's food to be at Monsieur le Maire 's expense . '' 
M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table . 
`` Here is the pay for two days in advance . '' 
`` Fourthly , for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy , and would fatigue the horse . 
Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that I own . '' 
`` I consent to that . '' 
`` It is light , but it has no cover . '' 
`` That makes no difference to me . '' 
`` Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter ? '' 
M. Madeleine did not reply . 
The Fleming resumed : -- `` That it is very cold ? '' 
M. Madeleine preserved silence .
