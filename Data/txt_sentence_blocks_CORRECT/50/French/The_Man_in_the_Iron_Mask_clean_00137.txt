`` Mademoiselle , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` you are in error when you speak of black women at Gigelli ; the women there have not jet faces ; it is true they are not white - they are yellow . '' 
`` Yellow ! '' 
exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties . 
`` Eh ! 
do not disparage it . 
I have never seen a finer color to match with black eyes and a coral mouth . '' 
`` So much the better for M. de Bragelonne , '' said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , with persistent malice . 
`` He will make amends for his loss . 
Poor fellow ! '' 
A profound silence followed these words ; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves - treat each other more cruelly than tigers . 
But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy Athenais ; she determined to make her blush likewise . 
Resuming the conversation without pause , `` Do you know , Louise , '' said she , `` that there is a great sin on your conscience ? '' 
`` What sin , mademoiselle ? '' 
stammered the unfortunate girl , looking round her for support , without finding it . 
`` Eh ! 
- why , '' continued Athenais , `` the poor young man was affianced to you ; he loved you ; you cast him off . '' 
`` Well , that is a right which every honest woman has , '' said Montalais , in an affected tone . 
`` When we know we can not constitute the happiness of a man , it is much better to cast him off . '' 
`` Cast him off ! 
or refuse him ! 
- that 's all very well , '' said Athenais , `` but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach herself with . 
The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars ; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with . '' 
Louise pressed her hand over her icy brow . 
`` And if he dies , '' continued her pitiless tormentor , `` you will have killed him . 
That is the sin . '' 
Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? '' 
D'Artagnan made several steps along the gallery , holding Louise on his arm ; then , when they were far enough removed from the others - `` What I had to say to you , mademoiselle , '' replied he , `` Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente has just expressed ; roughly and unkindly , it is true but still in its entirety . '' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die . 
She disappeared at one door , at the moment the king was entering by another . 
The first glance of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress . 
Not perceiving La Valliere , a frown came over his brow ; but as soon as he saw D'Artagnan , who bowed to him - `` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
cried he , `` you have been diligent ! 
I am much pleased with you . '' 
This was the superlative expression of royal satisfaction . 
Many men would have been ready to lay down their lives for such a speech from the king . 
The maids of honor and the courtiers , who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his entrance , drew back , on observing he wished to speak privately with his captain of the musketeers . 
The king led the way out of the gallery , after having again , with his eyes , sought everywhere for La Valliere , whose absence he could not account for . 
The moment they were out of the reach of curious ears , `` Well ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` the prisoner ? '' 
`` Is in his prison , sire . '' 
`` What did he say on the road ? '' 
`` Nothing , sire . '' 
`` What did he do ? '' 
`` There was a moment at which the fisherman - who took me in his boat to Sainte-Marguerite - revolted , and did his best to kill me . 
The - the prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly . '' 
The king became pale . 
`` Enough ! ''
