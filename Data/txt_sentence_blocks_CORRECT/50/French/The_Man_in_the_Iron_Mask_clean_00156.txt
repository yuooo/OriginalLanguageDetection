`` Yes , sire , I am not accustomed to take rest . '' 
`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he . 
`` If his first word is severe , '' again thought Fouquet ; `` if he becomes angry , or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext , how shall I extricate myself ? 
Let us smooth the declivity a little . 
Gourville was right . '' 
`` Sire , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the point of dispensing with my labor , may I not be allowed to be absent from the council of to-morrow ? 
I could pass the day in bed , and will entreat the king to grant me his physician , that we may endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever . '' 
`` So be it , Monsieur Fouquet , it shall be as you desire ; you shall have a holiday to-morrow , you shall have the physician , and shall be restored to health . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
said Fouquet , bowing . 
Then , opening his game : `` Shall I not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle - Isle ? '' 
And he looked Louis full in the face , to judge of the effect of such a proposal . 
The king blushed again . 
`` Do you know , '' replied he , endeavoring to smile , `` that you have just said , ` My residence of Belle-Isle ' ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Well ! 
do you not remember , '' continued the king in the same cheerful tone , `` that you gave me Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` That is true again , sire . 
Only , as you have not taken it , you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it . '' 
`` I mean to do so . '' 
`` That was , besides , your majesty 's intention as well as mine ; and I can not express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the king 's regiments from Paris to help take possession . '' 
The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that alone . 
`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . '' 
`` You have a boat of your own , nevertheless ? '' 
`` I have five ; but they are all in port , or at Paimboeuf ; and to join them , or bring them hither , would require at least twenty-four hours . 
Have I any occasion to send a courier ? 
Must I do so ? '' 
`` Wait a little , put an end to the fever , - wait till to-morrow . '' 
`` That is true . 
Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred other ideas ? '' 
replied Fouquet , now perfectly convinced and very pale . 
The king started , and stretched his hand out towards his little bell , but Fouquet prevented his ringing . 
`` Sire , '' said he , `` I have an ague - I am trembling with cold .
