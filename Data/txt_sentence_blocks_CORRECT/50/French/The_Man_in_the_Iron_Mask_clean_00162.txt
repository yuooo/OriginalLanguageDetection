`` Oh , monsieur ! 
the true king of royalty , in heart , in soul , is not Louis of the Louvre , or Philippe of Sainte - Marguerite ; it is you , proscribed , condemned ! '' 
`` I , who this day am ruined by a single error , M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` What , in the name of Heaven , is that ? '' 
`` I should have had you for a friend ! 
But how shall we return to Nantes ? 
We are a great way from it . '' 
`` That is true , '' said D'Artagnan , gloomily . 
`` The white horse will recover , perhaps ; he is a good horse ! 
Mount , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; I will walk till you have rested a little . '' 
`` Poor beast ! 
and wounded , too ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` He will go , I tell you ; I know him ; but we can do better still , let us both get up , and ride slowly . '' 
`` We can try , '' said the captain . 
But they had scarcely charged the animal with this double load , when he began to stagger , and then with a great effort walked a few minutes , then staggered again , and sank down dead by the side of the black horse , which he had just managed to come up to . 
`` We will go on foot - destiny wills it so - the walk will be pleasant , '' said Fouquet , passing his arm through that of D'Artagnan . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
cried the latter , with a fixed eye , a contracted brow , and a swelling heart - `` What a disgraceful day ! '' 
They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting . 
When Fouquet perceived that sinister machine , he said to D'Artagnan , who cast down his eyes , ashamed of Louis XIV. , `` There is an idea that did not emanate from a brave man , Captain d'Artagnan ; it is not yours . 
What are these gratings for ? '' 
said he . 
`` To prevent your throwing letters out . '' 
`` Ingenious ! '' 
`` But you can speak , if you can not write , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Can I speak to you ? '' 
`` Why , certainly , if you wish to do so . '' 
Fouquet reflected for a moment , then looking the captain full in the face , `` One single word , '' said he ; `` will you remember it ? '' 
`` I will not forget it . '' 
`` Will you speak it to whom I wish ? '' 
`` I will . '' 
`` Saint-Mande , '' articulated Fouquet , in a low voice . 
`` Well ! 
and for whom ? '' 
`` For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson . '' 
`` It shall be done . '' 
The carriage rolled through Nantes , and took the route to Angers . 
: In Which the Squirrel Falls , - the Adder Flies . 
It was two o'clock in the afternoon . 
The king , full of impatience , went to his cabinet on the terrace , and kept opening the door of the corridor , to see what his secretaries were doing . 
M. Colbert , seated in the same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning , was chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne . 
The king opened the door suddenly , and addressed them . 
`` What is it you are saying ? '' 
`` We were speaking of the first sitting of the States , '' said M. de Brienne , rising . 
`` Very well , '' replied the king , and returned to his room . 
Five minutes after , the summons of the bell recalled Rose , whose hour it was . 
`` Have you finished your copies ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Not yet , sire . ''
