I have seen some people . 
He will come here this evening at six o'clock . 
To bring sixty francs , the rascal ! 
Did you notice how I played that game on him , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of February ? 
I do n't even owe for one quarter ! 
Is n't he a fool ! 
So he will come at six o'clock ! 
That 's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner . 
Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city . 
There 's not a soul in the house . 
The neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock . 
The children shall stand on watch . 
You shall help us . 
He will give in . '' 
`` And what if he does not give in ? '' 
demanded his wife . 
Jondrette made a sinister gesture , and said : -- `` We 'll fix him . '' 
And he burst out laughing . 
This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh . 
The laugh was cold and sweet , and provoked a shudder . 
Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace , and drew from it an old cap , which he placed on his head , after brushing it with his sleeve . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` I 'm going out . 
I have some more people that I must see . 
Good ones . 
You 'll see how well the whole thing will work . 
I shall be away as short a time as possible , it 's a fine stroke of business , do you look after the house . '' 
And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers , he stood for a moment in thought , then exclaimed : -- `` Do you know , it 's mighty lucky , by the way , that he did n't recognize me ! 
If he had recognized me on his side , he would not have come back again . 
He would have slipped through our fingers ! 
It was my beard that saved us ! 
my romantic beard ! 
my pretty little romantic beard ! '' 
And again he broke into a laugh . 
He stepped to the window . 
The snow was still falling , and streaking the gray of the sky . 
`` What beastly weather ! '' 
said he . 
Then lapping his overcoat across his breast : -- `` This rind is too large for me . 
Never mind , '' he added , `` he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me , the old scoundrel ! 
If it had n't been for that , I could n't have gone out , and everything would have gone wrong ! 
What small points things hang on , anyway ! '' 
And pulling his cap down over his eyes , he quitted the room . 
He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door , when the door opened again , and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening . 
`` I came near forgetting , '' said he . 
`` You are to have a brazier of charcoal ready . '' 
And he flung into his wife 's apron the five-franc piece which the `` philanthropist '' had left with him . 
`` A brazier of charcoal ? '' 
asked his wife . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` How many bushels ? ''
