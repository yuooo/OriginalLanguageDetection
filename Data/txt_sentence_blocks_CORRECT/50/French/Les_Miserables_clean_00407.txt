There is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there . 
Bahorel will visit the Estrapade . 
Prouvaire , the masons are growing lukewarm ; you will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore . 
Joly will go to Dupuytren 's clinical lecture , and feel the pulse of the medical school . 
Bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates . 
I will take charge of the Cougourde myself . '' 
`` That arranges everything , '' said Courfeyrac . 
`` No . '' 
`` What else is there ? '' 
`` A very important thing . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Courfeyrac . 
`` The Barriere du Maine , '' replied Enjolras . 
Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection , then he resumed : -- `` At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers , painters , and journeymen in the studios of sculptors . 
They are an enthusiastic family , but liable to cool off . 
I do n't know what has been the matter with them for some time past . 
They are thinking of something else . 
They are becoming extinguished . 
They pass their time playing dominoes . 
There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little , but with firmness . 
They meet at Richefeu 's . 
They are to be found there between twelve and one o'clock . 
Those ashes must be fanned into a glow . 
For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius , who is a good fellow on the whole , but he no longer comes to us . 
I need some one for the Barriere du Maine . 
I have no one . '' 
`` What about me ? '' 
said Grantaire . 
`` Here am I. '' `` You ? '' 
`` I. '' `` You indoctrinate republicans ! 
you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Are you good for anything ? '' 
`` I have a vague ambition in that direction , '' said Grantaire . 
`` You do not believe in everything . '' 
`` I believe in you . '' 
`` Grantaire will you do me a service ? '' 
`` Anything . 
I 'll black your boots . '' 
`` Well , do n't meddle with our affairs . 
Sleep yourself sober from your absinthe . '' 
`` You are an ingrate , Enjolras . '' 
`` You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine ! 
You capable of it ! '' 
`` I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres , of crossing the Place Saint-Michel , of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , of taking the Rue de Vaugirard , of passing the Carmelites , of turning into the Rue d'Assas , of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi , of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre , of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries , of striding across the boulevard , of following the Chaussee du Maine , of passing the barrier , and entering Richefeu 's . 
I am capable of that . 
My shoes are capable of that . '' 
`` Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu 's ? '' 
`` Not much . 
We only address each other as thou . ''
