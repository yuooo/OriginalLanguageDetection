said Monsieur , in a fright . 
`` I will tell you all about that , brother ; but it is strange that M. d'Herblay is not here ! '' 
He called out : `` Let M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him - oh ! 
before you , before you ; do not retire ! '' 
M. de Saint-Aignan returned , bringing satisfactory news of the queen , who only kept her bed from precaution , and to have strength to carry out the king 's wishes . 
Whilst everybody was seeking M. Fouquet and Aramis , the new king quietly continued his experiments , and everybody , family , officers , servants , had not the least suspicion of his identity , his air , his voice , and manners were so like the king 's . 
On his side , Philippe , applying to all countenances the accurate descriptions and key-notes of character supplied by his accomplice Aramis , conducted himself so as not to give birth to a doubt in the minds of those who surrounded him . 
Nothing from that time could disturb the usurper . 
With what strange facility had Providence just reversed the loftiest fortune of the world to substitute the lowliest in its stead ! 
Philippe admired the goodness of God with regard to himself , and seconded it with all the resources of his admirable nature . 
But he felt , at times , something like a specter gliding between him and the rays of his new glory . 
Aramis did not appear . 
The conversation had languished in the royal family ; Philippe , preoccupied , forgot to dismiss his brother and Madame Henrietta . 
The latter were astonished , and began , by degrees , to lose all patience . 
Anne of Austria stooped towards her son 's ear and addressed some words to him in Spanish . 
Philippe was completely ignorant of that language , and grew pale at this unexpected obstacle . 
But , as if the spirit of the imperturbable Aramis had covered him with his infallibility , instead of appearing disconcerted , Philippe rose . 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
said Anne of Austria . 
`` What is all that noise ? '' 
said Philippe , turning round towards the door of the second staircase . 
And a voice was heard saying , `` This way , this way ! 
A few steps more , sire ! '' 
`` The voice of M. Fouquet , '' said D'Artagnan , who was standing close to the queen-mother . 
`` Then M. d'Herblay can not be far off , '' added Philippe . 
But he then saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him . 
All eyes were turned towards the door at which M. Fouquet was expected to enter ; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered . 
A terrible cry resounded from all corners of the chamber , a painful cry uttered by the king and all present . 
It is given to but few men , even those whose destiny contains the strangest elements , and accidents the most wonderful , to contemplate such a spectacle similar to that which presented itself in the royal chamber at that moment . 
The half-closed shutters only admitted the entrance of an uncertain light passing through thick violet velvet curtains lined with silk . 
In this soft shade , the eyes were by degrees dilated , and every one present saw others rather with imagination than with actual sight . 
There could not , however , escape , in these circumstances , one of the surrounding details ; and the new object which presented itself appeared as luminous as though it shone out in full sunlight . 
So it happened with Louis XIV. , when he showed himself , pale and frowning , in the doorway of the secret stairs . 
The face of Fouquet appeared behind him , stamped with sorrow and determination . 
The queen - mother , who perceived Louis XIV. , and who held the hand of Philippe , uttered a cry of which we have spoken , as if she beheld a phantom . 
Monsieur was bewildered , and kept turning his head in astonishment from one to the other . 
Madame made a step forward , thinking she was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror . 
And , in fact , the illusion was possible . 
The two princes , both pale as death - for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful state of Philippe - trembling , clenching their hands convulsively , measured each other with looks , and darted their glances , sharp as poniards , at each other . 
Silent , panting , bending forward , they appeared as if about to spring upon an enemy . 
The unheard-of resemblance of countenance , gesture , shape , height , even to the resemblance of costume , produced by chance -- for Louis XIV . 
had been to the Louvre and put on a violet-colored dress -- the perfect analogy of the two princes , completed the consternation of Anne of Austria . 
And yet she did not at once guess the truth . 
There are misfortunes in life so truly dreadful that no one will at first accept them ; people rather believe in the supernatural and the impossible . 
Louis had not reckoned on these obstacles . 
He expected that he had only to appear to be acknowledged . 
A living sun , he could not endure the suspicion of equality with any one . 
He did not admit that every torch should not become darkness at the instant he shone out with his conquering ray . 
At the aspect of Philippe , then , he was perhaps more terrified than any one round him , and his silence , his immobility were , this time , a concentration and a calm which precede the violent explosions of concentrated passion . 
But Fouquet ! 
who shall paint his emotion and stupor in presence of this living portrait of his master ! 
Fouquet thought Aramis was right , that this newly-arrived was a king as pure in his race as the other , and that , for having repudiated all participation in this coup d'etat , so skillfully got up by the General of the Jesuits , he must be a mad enthusiast , unworthy of ever dipping his hands in political grand strategy work . 
And then it was the blood of Louis XIII . 
which Fouquet was sacrificing to the blood of Louis XIII. ; it was to a selfish ambition he was sacrificing a noble ambition ; to the right of keeping he sacrificed the right of having . 
The whole extent of his fault was revealed to him at simple sight of the pretender . 
All that passed in the mind of Fouquet was lost upon the persons present . 
He had five minutes to focus meditation on this point of conscience ; five minutes , that is to say five ages , during which the two kings and their family scarcely found energy to breathe after so terrible a shock . 
D'Artagnan , leaning against the wall , in front of Fouquet , with his hand to his brow , asked himself the cause of such a wonderful prodigy . 
He could not have said at once why he doubted , but he knew assuredly that he had reason to doubt , and that in this meeting of the two Louis XIV.s lay all the doubt and difficulty that during late days had rendered the conduct of Aramis so suspicious to the musketeer . 
These ideas were , however , enveloped in a haze , a veil of mystery . 
The actors in this assembly seemed to swim in the vapors of a confused waking . 
Suddenly Louis XIV. , more impatient and more accustomed to command , ran to one of the shutters , which he opened , tearing the curtains in his eagerness . 
A flood of living light entered the chamber , and made Philippe draw back to the alcove . 
Louis seized upon this movement with eagerness , and addressing himself to the queen : `` My mother , '' said he , `` do you not acknowledge your son , since every one here has forgotten his king ! '' 
Anne of Austria started , and raised her arms towards Heaven , without being able to articulate a single word . 
`` My mother , '' said Philippe , with a calm voice , `` do you not acknowledge your son ? '' 
And this time , in his turn , Louis drew back . 
As to Anne of Austria , struck suddenly in head and heart with fell remorse , she lost her equilibrium . 
No one aiding her , for all were petrified , she sank back in her fauteuil , breathing a weak , trembling sigh . 
Louis could not endure the spectacle and the affront . 
He bounded towards D'Artagnan , over whose brain a vertigo was stealing and who staggered as he caught at the door for support . 
`` A moi ! 
mousquetaire ! '' 
said he . 
`` Look us in the face and say which is the paler , he or I ! '' 
This cry roused D'Artagnan , and stirred in his heart the fibers of obedience . 
He shook his head , and , without more hesitation , he walked straight up to Philippe , on whose shoulder he laid his hand , saying , `` Monsieur , you are my prisoner ! '' 
Philippe did not raise his eyes towards Heaven , nor stir from the spot , where he seemed nailed to the floor , his eye intently fixed upon the king his brother . 
He reproached him with a sublime silence for all misfortunes past , all tortures to come . 
Against this language of the soul the king felt he had no power ; he cast down his eyes , dragging away precipitately his brother and sister , forgetting his mother , sitting motionless within three paces of the son whom she left a second time to be condemned to death . 
Philippe approached Anne of Austria , and said to her , in a soft and nobly agitated voice : `` If I were not your son , I should curse you , my mother , for having rendered me so unhappy . '' 
D'Artagnan felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones . 
He bowed respectfully to the young prince , and said as he bent , `` Excuse me , monseigneur , I am but a soldier , and my oaths are his who has just left the chamber . '' 
`` Thank you , M. d'Artagnan ... . 
What has become of M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` M. d'Herblay is in safety , monseigneur , '' said a voice behind them ; `` and no one , while I live and am free , shall cause a hair to fall from his head . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
said the prince , smiling sadly . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , '' said Fouquet , kneeling , `` but he who is just gone out from hence was my guest . '' 
`` Here are , '' murmured Philippe , with a sigh , `` brave friends and good hearts . 
They make me regret the world . 
On , M. d'Artagnan , I follow you . '' 
At the moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room with his prisoner , Colbert appeared , and , after remitting an order from the king to D'Artagnan , retired . 
D'Artagnan read the paper , and then crushed it in his hand with rage . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the prince . 
`` Read , monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer . 
Philippe read the following words , hastily traced by the hand of the king : `` M. d'Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Ile Sainte-Marguerite . 
He will cover his face with an iron vizor , which the prisoner shall never raise except at peril of his life . '' 
`` That is just , '' said Philippe , with resignation ; `` I am ready . '' 
`` Aramis was right , '' said Fouquet , in a low voice , to the musketeer , `` this one is every whit as much a king as the other . '' 
`` More so ! '' 
replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He wanted only you and me . '' 
: In Which Porthos Thinks He Is Pursuing a Duchy . 
Aramis and Porthos , having profited by the time granted them by Fouquet , did honor to the French cavalry by their speed . 
Porthos did not clearly understand on what kind of mission he was forced to display so much velocity ; but as he saw Aramis spurring on furiously , he , Porthos , spurred on in the same way . 
They had soon , in this manner , placed twelve leagues between them and Vaux ; they were then obliged to change horses , and organize a sort of post arrangement . 
It was during a relay that Porthos ventured to interrogate Aramis discreetly . 
`` Hush ! '' 
replied the latter , `` know only that our fortune depends on our speed . '' 
As if Porthos had still been the musketeer , without a sou or a maille of 1626 , he pushed forward . 
That magic word `` fortune '' always means something in the human ear . 
It means enough for those who have nothing ; it means too much for those who have enough . 
`` I shall be made a duke ! '' 
said Porthos , aloud . 
He was speaking to himself . 
`` That is possible , '' replied Aramis , smiling after his own fashion , as Porthos 's horse passed him . 
Aramis felt , notwithstanding , as though his brain were on fire ; the activity of the body had not yet succeeded in subduing that of the mind . 
All there is of raging passion , mental toothache or mortal threat , raged , gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts of the unhappy prelate . 
His countenance exhibited visible traces of this rude combat . 
Free on the highway to abandon himself to every impression of the moment , Aramis did not fail to swear at every start of his horse , at every inequality in the road . 
Pale , at times inundated with boiling sweats , then again dry and icy , he flogged his horses till the blood streamed from their sides . 
Porthos , whose dominant fault was not sensibility , groaned at this . 
Thus traveled they on for eight long hours , and then arrived at Orleans . 
It was four o'clock in the afternoon . 
Aramis , on observing this , judged that nothing showed pursuit to be a possibility . 
It would be without example that a troop capable of taking him and Porthos should be furnished with relays sufficient to perform forty leagues in eight hours . 
Thus , admitting pursuit , which was not at all manifest , the fugitives were five hours in advance of their pursuers . 
Aramis thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little rest , but that to continue would make the matter more certain . 
Twenty leagues more , performed with the same rapidity , twenty more leagues devoured , and no one , not even D'Artagnan , could overtake the enemies of the king . 
Aramis felt obliged , therefore , to inflict upon Porthos the pain of mounting on horseback again . 
They rode on till seven o'clock in the evening , and had only one post more between them and Blois . 
But here a diabolical accident alarmed Aramis greatly . 
There were no horses at the post . 
The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination his enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going further , - he who never recognized chance as a deity , who found a cause for every accident , preferred believing that the refusal of the postmaster , at such an hour , in such a country , was the consequence of an order emanating from above : an order given with a view of stopping short the king-maker in the midst of his flight . 
But at the moment he was about to fly into a passion , so as to procure either a horse or an explanation , he was struck with the recollection that the Comte de la Fere lived in the neighborhood . 
`` I am not traveling , '' said he ; `` I do not want horses for a whole stage . 
Find me two horses to go and pay a visit to a nobleman of my acquaintance who resides near this place . '' 
`` What nobleman ? '' 
asked the postmaster . 
`` M. le Comte de la Fere . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied the postmaster , uncovering with respect , `` a very worthy nobleman . 
But , whatever may be my desire to make myself agreeable to him , I can not furnish you with horses , for all mine are engaged by M. le Duc de Beaufort . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis , much disappointed . 
`` Only , '' continued the postmaster , `` if you will put up with a little carriage I have , I will harness an old blind horse who has still his legs left , and peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de la Fere . '' 
`` It is worth a louis , '' said Aramis . 
`` No , monsieur , such a ride is worth no more than a crown ; that is what M. Grimaud , the comte 's intendant , always pays me when he makes use of that carriage ; and I should not wish the Comte de la Fere to have to reproach me with having imposed on one of his friends . '' 
`` As you please , '' said Aramis , `` particularly as regards disobliging the Comte de la Fere ; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for your idea . '' 
`` Oh ! 
doubtless , '' replied the postmaster with delight . 
And he himself harnessed the ancient horse to the creaking carriage . 
In the meantime Porthos was curious to behold . 
He imagined he had discovered a clew to the secret , and he felt pleased , because a visit to Athos , in the first place , promised him much satisfaction , and , in the next , gave him the hope of finding at the same time a good bed and good supper . 
The master , having got the carriage ready , ordered one of his men to drive the strangers to La Fere . 
Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis , whispering in his ear , `` I understand . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
said Aramis , `` and what do you understand , my friend ? '' 
`` We are going , on the part of the king , to make some great proposal to Athos . '' 
`` Pooh ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` You need tell me nothing about it , '' added the worthy Porthos , endeavoring to reseat himself so as to avoid the jolting , `` you need tell me nothing , I shall guess . '' 
`` Well ! 
do , my friend ; guess away . '' 
They arrived at Athos 's dwelling about nine o'clock in the evening , favored by a splendid moon . 
This cheerful light rejoiced Porthos beyond expression ; but Aramis appeared annoyed by it in an equal degree . 
He could not help showing something of this to Porthos , who replied - `` Ay ! 
ay ! 
I guess how it is ! 
the mission is a secret one . '' 
These were his last words in the carriage . 
The driver interrupted him by saying , `` Gentlemen , we have arrived . '' 
Porthos and his companion alighted before the gate of the little chateau , where we are about to meet again our old acquaintances Athos and Bragelonne , the latter of whom had disappeared since the discovery of the infidelity of La Valliere . 
If there be one saying truer than another , it is this : great griefs contain within themselves the germ of consolation . 
This painful wound , inflicted upon Raoul , had drawn him nearer to his father again ; and God knows how sweet were the consolations which flowed from the eloquent mouth and generous heart of Athos . 
The wound was not cicatrized , but Athos , by dint of conversing with his son and mixing a little more of his life with that of the young man , had brought him to understand that this pang of a first infidelity is necessary to every human existence ; and that no one has loved without encountering it . 
Raoul listened , again and again , but never understood . 
Nothing replaces in the deeply afflicted heart the remembrance and thought of the beloved object . 
Raoul then replied to the reasoning of his father : `` Monsieur , all that you tell me is true ; I believe that no one has suffered in the affections of the heart so much as you have ; but you are a man too great by reason of intelligence , and too severely tried by adverse fortune not to allow for the weakness of the soldier who suffers for the first time . 
I am paying a tribute that will not be paid a second time ; permit me to plunge myself so deeply in my grief that I may forget myself in it , that I may drown even my reason in it . '' 
`` Raoul ! 
Raoul ! '' 
`` Listen , monsieur . 
Never shall I accustom myself to the idea that Louise , the chastest and most innocent of women , has been able to so basely deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself . 
Never can I persuade myself that I see that sweet and noble mask change into a hypocritical lascivious face . 
Louise lost ! 
Louise infamous ! 
Ah ! 
monseigneur , that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul abandoned -- Raoul unhappy ! '' 
Athos then employed the heroic remedy . 
He defended Louise against Raoul , and justified her perfidy by her love . 
`` A woman who would have yielded to a king because he is a king , '' said he , `` would deserve to be styled infamous ; but Louise loves Louis . 
Young , both , they have forgotten , he his rank , she her vows . 
Love absolves everything , Raoul . 
The two young people love each other with sincerity . '' 
And when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust , Athos , with a sigh , saw Raoul bound away beneath the rankling wound , and fly to the thickest recesses of the wood , or the solitude of his chamber , whence , an hour after , he would return , pale , trembling , but subdued . 
Then , coming up to Athos with a smile , he would kiss his hand , like the dog who , having been beaten , caresses a respected master , to redeem his fault . 
Raoul redeemed nothing but his weakness , and only confessed his grief . 
Thus passed away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had so violently shaken the indomitable pride of the king . 
Never , when conversing with his son , did he make any allusion to that scene ; never did he give him the details of that vigorous lecture , which might , perhaps , have consoled the young man , by showing him his rival humbled . 
Athos did not wish that the offended lover should forget the respect due to his king . 
And when Bragelonne , ardent , angry , and melancholy , spoke with contempt of royal words , of the equivocal faith which certain madmen draw from promises that emanate from thrones , when , passing over two centuries , with that rapidity of a bird that traverses a narrow strait to go from one continent to the other , Raoul ventured to predict the time in which kings would be esteemed as less than other men , Athos said to him , in his serene , persuasive voice , `` You are right , Raoul ; all that you say will happen ; kings will lose their privileges , as stars which have survived their aeons lose their splendor . 
But when that moment comes , Raoul , we shall be dead . 
And remember well what I say to you . 
In this world , all , men , women , and kings , must live for the present . 
We can only live for the future for God . '' 
This was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were , as usual , conversing , and walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park , when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the hour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor , was rung ; and , without attaching any importance to it , he turned towards the house with his son ; and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence of Aramis and Porthos . 
: The Last Adieux . 
Raoul uttered a cry , and affectionately embraced Porthos . 
Aramis and Athos embraced like old men ; and this embrace itself being a question for Aramis , he immediately said , `` My friend , we have not long to remain with you . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the comte . 
`` Only time to tell you of my good fortune , '' interrupted Porthos . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Raoul . 
Athos looked silently at Aramis , whose somber air had already appeared to him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted . 
`` What is the good fortune that has happened to you ? 
Let us hear it , '' said Raoul , with a smile . 
`` The king has made me a duke , '' said the worthy Porthos , with an air of mystery , in the ear of the young man , `` a duke by brevet . '' 
But the asides of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by everybody . 
His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring . 
Athos heard him , and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start . 
The latter took Athos by the arm , and , after having asked Porthos 's permission to say a word to his friend in private , `` My dear Athos , '' he began , `` you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble . '' 
`` With grief and trouble , my dear friend ? '' 
cried the comte ; `` oh , what ? '' 
`` In two words . 
I have conspired against the king ; that conspiracy has failed , and , at this moment , I am doubtless pursued . '' 
`` You are pursued ! 
- a conspiracy ! 
Eh ! 
my friend , what do you tell me ? '' 
`` The saddest truth . 
I am entirely ruined . '' 
`` Well , but Porthos - this title of duke - what does all that mean ? '' 
`` That is the subject of my severest pain ; that is the deepest of my wounds . 
I have , believing in infallible success , drawn Porthos into my conspiracy . 
He threw himself into it , as you know he would do , with all his strength , without knowing what he was about ; and now he is as much compromised as myself - as completely ruined as I am . '' 
`` Good God ! '' 
And Athos turned towards Porthos , who was smiling complacently . 
`` I must make you acquainted with the whole . 
Listen to me , '' continued Aramis ; and he related the history as we know it . 
Athos , during the recital , several times felt the sweat break from his forehead . 
`` It was a great idea , '' said he , `` but a great error . '' 
`` For which I am punished , Athos . '' 
`` Therefore , I will not tell you my entire thought . '' 
`` Tell it , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is a crime . '' 
`` A capital crime ; I know it is . 
Lese majeste . '' 
`` Porthos ! 
poor Porthos ! '' 
`` What would you advise me to do ? 
Success , as I have told you , was certain . '' 
`` M. Fouquet is an honest man . '' 
`` And I a fool for having so ill-judged him , '' said Aramis . 
`` Oh , the wisdom of man ! 
Oh , millstone that grinds the world ! 
and which is one day stopped by a grain of sand which has fallen , no one knows how , between its wheels . '' 
`` Say by a diamond , Aramis . 
But the thing is done . 
How do you think of acting ? '' 
`` I am taking away Porthos . 
The king will never believe that that worthy man has acted innocently . 
He never can believe that Porthos has thought he was serving the king , whilst acting as he has done . 
His head would pay my fault . 
It shall not , must not , be so . '' 
`` You are taking him away , whither ? '' 
`` To Belle-Isle , at first . 
That is an impregnable place of refuge . 
Then , I have the sea , and a vessel to pass over into England , where I have many relations . '' 
`` You ? 
in England ? '' 
`` Yes , or else in Spain , where I have still more . '' 
`` But , our excellent Porthos ! 
you ruin him , for the king will confiscate all his property . '' 
`` All is provided for . 
I know how , when once in Spain , to reconcile myself with Louis XIV. , and restore Porthos to favor . '' 
`` You have credit , seemingly , Aramis ! '' 
said Athos , with a discreet air . 
`` Much ; and at the service of my friends . '' 
These words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand . 
`` Thank you , '' replied the comte . 
`` And while we are on this head , '' said Aramis , `` you also are a malcontent ; you also , Raoul , have griefs to lay to the king . 
Follow our example ; pass over into Belle-Isle . 
Then we shall see , I guarantee upon my honor , that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the subject of this son of Louis XIII. , who is an Infante likewise , and whom France detains inhumanly . 
Now , as Louis XIV . 
would have no inclination for a war on that subject , I will answer for an arrangement , the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me , and a duchy in France to you , who are already a grandee of Spain . 
Will you join us ? '' 
`` No ; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with ; it is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal races . 
Doing what you propose , I should become the obliged of the king ; I should certainly be the gainer on that ground , but I should be a loser in my conscience . 
- No , thank you ! '' 
`` Then give me two things , Athos , - your absolution . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed against the oppressor . '' 
`` That is sufficient for me , '' said Aramis , with a blush which was lost in the obscurity of the night . 
`` And now , give me your two best horses to gain the second post , as I have been refused any under the pretext of the Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country . '' 
`` You shall have the two best horses , Aramis ; and again I recommend poor Porthos strongly to your care . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have no fear on that score . 
One word more : do you think I am maneuvering for him as I ought ? '' 
`` The evil being committed , yes ; for the king would not pardon him , and you have , whatever may be said , always a supporter in M. Fouquet , who will not abandon you , he being himself compromised , notwithstanding his heroic action . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that is why , instead of gaining the sea at once , which would proclaim my fear and guilt , that is why I remain upon French ground . 
But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be , English , Spanish , or Roman ; all will depend , with me , on the standard I shall think proper to unfurl . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` It was I who fortified Belle-Isle ; and , so long as I defend it , nobody can take Belle-Isle from me . 
And then , as you have said just now , M. Fouquet is there . 
Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` That is true . 
Nevertheless , be prudent . 
The king is both cunning and strong . '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` I again recommend Porthos to you , '' repeated the count , with a sort of cold persistence . 
`` Whatever becomes of me , count , '' replied Aramis , in the same tone , `` our brother Porthos will fare as I do - or better . '' 
Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis , and turned to embrace Porthos with emotion . 
`` I was born lucky , was I not ? '' 
murmured the latter , transported with happiness , as he folded his cloak round him . 
`` Come , my dear friend , '' said Aramis . 
Raoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses . 
The group was already divided . 
Athos saw his two friends on the point of departure , and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed upon his heart . 
`` It is strange , '' thought he , `` whence comes the inclination I feel to embrace Porthos once more ? '' 
At that moment Porthos turned round , and he came towards his old friend with open arms . 
This last endearment was tender as in youth , as in times when hearts were warm - life happy . 
And then Porthos mounted his horse . 
Aramis came back once more to throw his arms round the neck of Athos . 
The latter watched them along the high - road , elongated by the shade , in their white cloaks . 
Like phantoms they seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth , and it was not in the mist , but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared . 
At the end of the perspective , both seemed to have given a spring with their feet , which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land . 
Then Athos , with a very heavy heart , returned towards the house , saying to Bragelonne , `` Raoul , I do n't know what it is that has just told me that I have seen those two for the last time . '' 
`` It does not astonish me , monsieur , that you should have such a thought , '' replied the young man , `` for I have at this moment the same , and think also that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d'Herblay again . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you , '' replied the count , `` you speak like a man rendered sad by a different cause ; you see everything in black ; you are young , and if you chance never to see those old friends again , it will because they no longer exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass . 
But I - '' Raoul shook his head sadly , and leaned upon the shoulder of the count , without either of them finding another word in their hearts , which were ready to overflow . 
All at once a noise of horses and voices , from the extremity of the road to Blois , attracted their attention that way . 
Flambeaux-bearers shook their torches merrily among the trees of their route , and turned round , from time to time , to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them . 
These flames , this noise , this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned horses , formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the melancholy and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of Aramis and Porthos . 
Athos went towards the house ; but he had hardly reached the parterre , when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze ; all the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road . 
A cry was heard of `` M. le Duc de Beaufort '' - and Athos sprang towards the door of his house . 
But the duke had already alighted from his horse , and was looking around him . 
`` I am here , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Ah ! 
good evening , dear count , '' said the prince , with that frank cordiality which won him so many hearts . 
`` Is it too late for a friend ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear prince , come in ! '' 
said the count . 
And , M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos , they entered the house , followed by Raoul , who walked respectfully and modestly among the officers of the prince , with several of whom he was acquainted . 
: Monsieur de Beaufort . 
The prince turned round at the moment when Raoul , in order to leave him alone with Athos , was shutting the door , and preparing to go with the other officers into an adjoining apartment . 
`` Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of ? '' 
asked M. de Beaufort . 
`` It is , monseigneur . '' 
`` He is quite the soldier ; let him stay , count , we can not spare him . '' 
`` Remain , Raoul , since monseigneur permits it , '' said Athos . 
`` Ma foi ! 
he is tall and handsome ! '' 
continued the duke . 
`` Will you give him to me , monseigneur , if I ask him of you ? '' 
`` How am I to understand you , monseigneur ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Why , I call upon you to bid you farewell . '' 
`` Farewell ! '' 
`` Yes , in good truth . 
Have you no idea of what I am about to become ? '' 
`` Why , I suppose , what you have always been , monseigneur , - a valiant prince , and an excellent gentleman . '' 
`` I am going to become an African prince , - a Bedouin gentleman . 
The king is sending me to make conquests among the Arabs . '' 
`` What is this you tell me , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Strange , is it not ? 
I , the Parisian par essence , I who have reigned in the faubourgs , and have been called King of the Halles , - I am going to pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli ; from a Frondeur I am becoming an adventurer ! '' 
`` Oh , monseigneur , if you did not yourself tell me that - '' `` It would not be credible , would it ? 
Believe me , nevertheless , and we have but to bid each other farewell . 
This is what comes of getting into favor again . '' 
`` Into favor ? '' 
`` Yes . 
You smile . 
Ah , my dear count , do you know why I have accepted this enterprise , can you guess ? '' 
`` Because your highness loves glory above - everything . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no ; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages . 
I see no glory in that , for my part , and it is more probable that I shall there meet with something else . 
But I have wished , and still wish earnestly , my dear count , that my life should have that last facet , after all the whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years . 
For , in short , you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born the grandson of a king , to have made war against kings , to have been reckoned among the powers of the age , to have maintained my rank , to feel Henry IV . 
within me , to be great admiral of France - and then to go and get killed at Gigelli , among all those Turks , Saracens , and Moors . '' 
`` Monseigneur , you harp with strange persistence on that theme , '' said Athos , in an agitated voice . 
`` How can you suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene ? '' 
`` And can you believe , upright and simple as you are , that if I go into Africa for this ridiculous motive , I will not endeavor to come out of it without ridicule ? 
Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me ? 
And to be spoken of , nowadays , when there are Monsieur le Prince , M. de Turenne , and many others , my contemporaries , I , admiral of France , grandson of Henry IV. , king of Paris , have I anything left but to get myself killed ? 
Cordieu ! 
I will be talked of , I tell you ; I shall be killed whether or not ; if no there , somewhere else . '' 
`` Why , monseigneur , this is mere exaggeration ; and hitherto you have shown nothing exaggerated save in bravery . '' 
`` Peste ! 
my dear friend , there is bravery in facing scurvy , dysentery , locusts , poisoned arrows , as my ancestor St. Louis did . 
Do you know those fellows still use poisoned arrows ? 
And then , you know me of old , I fancy , and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing , I perform it in grim earnest . '' 
`` Yes , you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes . '' 
`` Ay , but you aided me in that , my master ; and , a propos , I turn this way and that , without seeing my old friend , M. Vaugrimaud . 
How is he ? '' 
`` M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness 's most respectful servant , '' said Athos , smiling . 
`` I have a hundred pistoles here for him , which I bring as a legacy . 
My will is made , count . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` And you may understand that if Grimaud 's name were to appear in my will - '' The duke began to laugh ; then addressing Raoul , who , from the commencement of this conversation , had sunk into a profound reverie , `` Young man , '' said he , `` I know there is to be found here a certain De Vouvray wine , and I believe - '' Raoul left the room precipitately to order the wine . 
In the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos . 
`` What do you mean to do with him ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing at present , monseigneur . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , I know ; since the passion of the king for La Valliere . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` That is all true , then , is it ? 
I think I know her , that little La Valliere . 
She is not particularly handsome , if I remember right ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Do you know whom she reminds me of ? '' 
`` Does she remind your highness of any one ? '' 
`` She reminds me of a very agreeable girl , whose mother lived in the Halles . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
said Athos , smiling . 
`` Oh ! 
the good old times , '' added M. de Beaufort . 
`` Yes , La Valliere reminds me of that girl . '' 
`` Who had a son , had she not ? '' 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- `` I believe she had , '' replied the duke , with careless naivete and a complaisant forgetfulness , of which no words could translate the tone and the vocal expression . 
`` Now , here is poor Raoul , who is your son , I believe . '' 
`` Yes , he is my son , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the poor lad has been cut out by the king , and he frets . '' 
`` Still better , monseigneur , he abstains . '' 
`` You are going to let the boy rust in idleness ; it is a mistake . 
Come , give him to me . '' 
`` My wish is to keep him at home , monseigneur . 
I have no longer anything in the world but him , and as long as he likes to remain - '' `` Well , well , '' replied the duke . 
`` I could , nevertheless , have soon put matters to rights again . 
I assure you , I think he has in him the stuff of which marechals of France are made ; I have seen more than one produced from less likely rough material . '' 
`` That is very possible , monseigneur ; but it is the king who makes marechals of France , and Raoul will never accept anything of the king . '' 
Raoul interrupted this conversation by his return . 
He preceded Grimaud , whose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle of the duke 's favorite wine . 
On seeing his old protege , the duke uttered an exclamation of pleasure . 
`` Grimaud ! 
Good evening , Grimaud ! '' 
said he ; `` how goes it ? '' 
The servant bowed profoundly , as much gratified as his noble interlocutor . 
`` Two old friends ! '' 
said the duke , shaking honest Grimaud 's shoulder after a vigorous fashion ; which was followed by another still more profound and delighted bow from Grimaud . 
`` But what is this , count , only one glass ? '' 
`` I should not think of drinking with your highness , unless your highness permitted me , '' replied Athos , with noble humility . 
`` Cordieu ! 
you were right to bring only one glass , we will both drink out of it , like two brothers in arms . 
Begin , count . '' 
`` Do me the honor , '' said Athos , gently putting back the glass . 
`` You are a charming friend , '' replied the Duc de Beaufort , who drank , and passed the goblet to his companion . 
`` But that is not all , '' continued he , `` I am still thirsty , and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man who stands here . 
I carry good luck with me , vicomte , '' said he to Raoul ; `` wish for something while drinking out of my glass , and may the black plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass ! '' 
He held the goblet to Raoul , who hastily moistened his lips , and replied with the same promptitude : `` I have wished for something , monseigneur . '' 
His eyes sparkled with a gloomy fire , and the blood mounted to his cheeks ; he terrified Athos , if only with his smile . 
`` And what have you wished for ? '' 
replied the duke , sinking back into his fauteuil , whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud , and with the other gave him a purse . 
`` Will you promise me , monseigneur , to grant me what I wish for ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
That is agreed upon . '' 
`` I wished , monsieur le duc , to go with you to Gigelli . '' 
Athos became pale , and was unable to conceal his agitation . 
The duke looked at his friend , as if desirous to assist him to parry this unexpected blow . 
`` That is difficult , my dear vicomte , very difficult , '' added he , in a lower tone of voice . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , I have been indiscreet , '' replied Raoul , in a firm voice ; `` but as you yourself invited me to wish - '' `` To wish to leave me ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur - can you imagine - '' `` Well , mordieu ! '' 
cried the duke , `` the young vicomte is right ! 
What can he do here ? 
He will go moldy with grief . '' 
Raoul blushed , and the excitable prince continued : `` War is a distraction : we gain everything by it ; we can only lose one thing by it - life - then so much the worse ! '' 
`` That is to say , memory , '' said Raoul , eagerly ; `` and that is to say , so much the better ! '' 
He repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open the window ; which was , doubtless , to conceal his emotion . 
Raoul sprang towards the comte , but the latter had already overcome his emotion , and turned to the lights with a serene and impassible countenance . 
`` Well , come , '' said the duke , `` let us see ! 
Shall he go , or shall he not ? 
If he goes , comte , he shall be my aide-de-camp , my son . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Raoul , bending his knee . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , taking the hand of the duke ; `` Raoul shall do just as he likes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , monsieur , just as you like , '' interrupted the young man . 
`` Par la corbleu ! '' 
said the prince in his turn , `` it is neither the comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way , it is I. I will take him away . 
The marine offers a superb fortune , my friend . '' 
Raoul smiled again so sadly , that this time Athos felt his heart penetrated by it , and replied to him by a severe look . 
Raoul comprehended it all ; he recovered his calmness , and was so guarded , that not another word escaped him . 
The duke at length rose , on observing the advanced hour , and said , with animation , `` I am in great haste , but if I am told I have lost time in talking with a friend , I will reply I have gained - on the balance - a most excellent recruit . '' 
`` Pardon me , monsieur le duc , '' interrupted Raoul , `` do not tell the king so , for it is not the king I wish to serve . '' 
`` Eh ! 
my friend , whom , then , will you serve ? 
The times are past when you might have said , ' I belong to M. de Beaufort . ' 
No , nowadays , we all belong to the king , great or small . 
Therefore , if you serve on board my vessels , there can be nothing equivocal about it , my dear vicomte ; it will be the king you will serve . '' 
Athos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made to this embarrassing question by Raoul , the intractable enemy of the king , his rival . 
The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the desire . 
He was thankful to M. de Beaufort , whose lightness or generous reflection had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a son , now his only joy . 
But Raoul , still firm and tranquil , replied : `` Monsieur le duc , the objection you make I have already considered in my mind . 
I will serve on board your vessels , because you do me the honor to take me with you ; but I shall there serve a more powerful master than the king : I shall serve God ! '' 
`` God ! 
how so ? '' 
said the duke and Athos together . 
`` My intention is to make profession , and become a knight of Malta , '' added Bragelonne , letting fall , one by one , words more icy than the drops which fall from the bare trees after the tempests of winter . 
-LRB- 4 -RRB- Under this blow Athos staggered and the prince himself was moved . 
Grimaud uttered a heavy groan , and let fall the bottle , which was broken without anybody paying attention . 
M. de Beaufort looked the young man in the face , and read plainly , though his eyes were cast down , the fire of resolution before which everything must give way . 
As to Athos , he was too well acquainted with that tender , but inflexible soul ; he could not hope to make it deviate from the fatal road it had just chosen . 
He could only press the hand the duke held out to him . 
`` Comte , I shall set off in two days for Toulon , '' said M. de Beaufort . 
`` Will you meet me at Paris , in order that I may know your determination ? '' 
`` I will have the honor of thanking you there , mon prince , for all your kindness , '' replied the comte . 
`` And be sure to bring the vicomte with you , whether he follows me or does not follow me , '' added the duke ; `` he has my word , and I only ask yours . '' 
Having thrown a little balm upon the wound of the paternal heart , he pulled the ear of Grimaud , whose eyes sparkled more than usual , and regained his escort in the parterre . 
The horses , rested and refreshed , set off with spirit through the lovely night , and soon placed a considerable distance between their master and the chateau . 
Athos and Bragelonne were again face to face . 
Eleven o'clock was striking . 
The father and son preserved a profound silence towards each other , where an intelligent observer would have expected cries and tears . 
But these two men were of such a nature that all emotion following their final resolutions plunged itself so deep into their hearts that it was lost forever . 
They passed , then , silently and almost breathlessly , the hour that preceded midnight . 
The clock , by striking , alone pointed out to them how many minutes had lasted the painful journey made by their souls in the immensity of their remembrances of the past and fear of the future . 
Athos rose first , saying , `` it is late , then ... . 
Till to-morrow . '' 
Raoul rose , and in his turn embraced his father . 
The latter held him clasped to his breast , and said , in a tremulous voice , `` In two days , you will have left me , my son - left me forever , Raoul ! '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the young man , `` I had formed a determination , that of piercing my heart with my sword ; but you would have thought that cowardly . 
I have renounced that determination , and therefore we must part . '' 
`` You leave me desolate by going , Raoul . '' 
`` Listen to me again , monsieur , I implore you . 
If I do not go , I shall die here of grief and love . 
I know how long a time I have to live thus . 
Send me away quickly , monsieur , or you will see me basely die before your eyes - in your house - this is stronger than my will - stronger than my strength - you may plainly see that within one month I have lived thirty years , and that I approach the end of my life . '' 
`` Then , '' said Athos , coldly , `` you go with the intention of getting killed in Africa ? 
Oh , tell me ! 
do not lie ! '' 
Raoul grew deadly pale , and remained silent for two seconds , which were to his father two hours of agony . 
Then , all at once : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` I have promised to devote myself to God . 
In exchange for the sacrifice I make of my youth and liberty , I will only ask of Him one thing , and that is , to preserve me for you , because you are the only tie which attaches me to this world . 
God alone can give me the strength not to forget that I owe you everything , and that nothing ought to stand in my esteem before you . '' 
Athos embraced his son tenderly , and said : `` You have just replied to me on the word of honor of an honest man ; in two days we shall be with M. de Beaufort at Paris , and you will then do what will be proper for you to do . 
You are free , Raoul ; adieu . '' 
And he slowly gained his bedroom . 
Raoul went down into the garden , and passed the night in the alley of limes . 
: Preparations for Departure . 
Athos lost no more time in combating this immutable resolution . 
He gave all his attention to preparing , during the two days the duke had granted him , the proper appointments for Raoul . 
This labor chiefly concerned Grimaud , who immediately applied himself to it with the good-will and intelligence we know he possessed . 
Athos gave this worthy servant orders to take the route to Paris when the equipments should be ready ; and , not to expose himself to the danger of keeping the duke waiting , or delaying Raoul , so that the duke should perceive his absence , he himself , the day after the visit of M. de Beaufort , set off for Paris with his son . 
For the poor young man it was an emotion easily to be understood , thus to return to Paris amongst all the people who had known and loved him . 
Every face recalled a pang to him who had suffered so much ; to him who had loved so much , some circumstance of his unhappy love . 
Raoul , on approaching Paris , felt as if he were dying . 
Once in Paris , he really existed no longer . 
When he reached Guiche 's residence , he was informed that Guiche was with Monsieur . 
Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg , and when arrived , without suspecting that he was going to the place where La Valliere had lived , he heard so much music and respired so many perfumes , he heard so much joyous laughter , and saw so many dancing shadows , that if it had not been for a charitable woman , who perceived him so dejected and pale beneath a doorway , he would have remained there a few minutes , and then would have gone away , never to return . 
But , as we have said , in the first ante-chamber he had stopped , solely for the sake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were moving around him in the adjacent salons . 
And as one of Monsieur 's servants , recognizing him , had asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or Madame , Raoul had scarcely answered him , but had sunk down upon a bench near the velvet doorway , looking at a clock , which had stopped for nearly an hour . 
The servant had passed on , and another , better acquainted with him , had come up , and interrogated Raoul whether he should inform M. de Guiche of his being there . 
This name did not even arouse the recollections of Raoul . 
The persistent servant went on to relate that De Guiche had just invented a new game of lottery , and was teaching it to the ladies . 
Raoul , opening his large eyes , like the absent man in Theophrastus , made no answer , but his sadness increased two shades . 
With his head hanging down , his limbs relaxed , his mouth half open for the escape of his sighs , Raoul remained , thus forgotten , in the ante-chamber , when all at once a lady 's robe passed , rubbing against the doors of a side salon , which opened on the gallery . 
A lady , young , pretty , and gay , scolding an officer of the household , entered by that way , and expressed herself with much vivacity . 
The officer replied in calm but firm sentences ; it was rather a little love pet than a quarrel of courtiers , and was terminated by a kiss on the fingers of the lady . 
Suddenly , on perceiving Raoul , the lady became silent , and pushing away the officer : `` Make your escape , Malicorne , '' said she ; `` I did not think there was any one here . 
I shall curse you , if they have either heard or seen us ! '' 
Malicorne hastened away . 
The young lady advanced behind Raoul , and stretching her joyous face over him as he lay : `` Monsieur is a gallant man , '' said she , `` and no doubt - '' She here interrupted herself by uttering a cry . 
`` Raoul ! '' 
said she , blushing . 
`` Mademoiselle de Montalais ! '' 
said Raoul , paler than death . 
He rose unsteadily , and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic of the floor ; but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief ; she felt that in the flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself . 
A woman , ever vigilant , she did not think she ought to let the opportunity slip of making good her justification ; but Raoul , though stopped by her in the middle of the gallery , did not seem disposed to surrender without a combat . 
He took it up in a tone so cold and embarrassed , that if they had been thus surprised , the whole court would have no doubt about the proceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur , '' said she with disdain , `` what you are doing is very unworthy of a gentleman . 
My heart inclines me to speak to you ; you compromise me by a reception almost uncivil ; you are wrong , monsieur ; and you confound your friends with enemies . 
Farewell ! '' 
Raoul had sworn never to speak of Louise , never even to look at those who might have seen Louise ; he was going into another world , that he might never meet with anything Louise had seen , or even touched . 
But after the first shock of his pride , after having had a glimpse of Montalais , the companion of Louise - Montalais , who reminded him of the turret of Blois and the joys of youth - all his reason faded away . 
`` Pardon me , mademoiselle ; it enters not , it can not enter into my thoughts to be uncivil . '' 
`` Do you wish to speak to me ? '' 
said she , with the smile of former days . 
`` Well ! 
come somewhere else ; for we may be surprised . '' 
`` Oh ! ' 
said he . 
She looked at the clock , doubtingly , then , having reflected : `` In my apartment , '' said she , `` we shall have an hour to ourselves . '' 
And taking her course , lighter than a fairy , she ran up to her chamber , followed by Raoul . 
Shutting the door , and placing in the hands of her cameriste the mantle she had held upon her arm : `` You were seeking M. de Guiche , were you not ? '' 
said she to Raoul . 
`` Yes , mademoiselle . '' 
`` I will go and ask him to come up here , presently , after I have spoken to you . '' 
`` Do so , mademoiselle . '' 
`` Are you angry with me ? '' 
Raoul looked at her for a moment , then , casting down his eyes , `` Yes , '' said he . 
`` You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture , do you not ? '' 
`` Rupture ! '' 
said he , with bitterness . 
`` Oh ! 
mademoiselle , there can be no rupture where there has been no love . '' 
`` You are in error , '' replied Montalais ; `` Louise did love you . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` Not with love , I know ; but she liked you , and you ought to have married her before you set out for London . '' 
Raoul broke into a sinister laugh , which made Montalais shudder . 
`` You tell me that very much at your ease , mademoiselle . 
Do people marry whom they like ? 
You forget that the king then kept for himself as his mistress her of whom we are speaking . '' 
`` Listen , '' said the young woman , pressing the hands of Raoul in her own , `` you were wrong in every way ; a man of your age ought never to leave a woman of hers alone . '' 
`` There is no longer any faith in the world , then , '' said Raoul . 
`` No , vicomte , '' said Montalais , quietly . 
`` Nevertheless , let me tell you that , if , instead of loving Louise coldly and philosophically , you had endeavored to awaken her to love - '' `` Enough , I pray you , mademoiselle , '' said Raoul . 
`` I feel as though you are all , of both sexes , of a different age from me . 
You can laugh , and you can banter agreeably . 
I , mademoiselle , I loved Mademoiselle de - '' Raoul could not pronounce her name , - `` I loved her well ! 
I put my faith in her - now I am quits by loving her no longer . '' 
`` Oh , vicomte ! '' 
said Montalais , pointing to his reflection in a looking - glass . 
`` I know what you mean , mademoiselle ; I am much altered , am I not ? 
Well ! 
Do you know why ? 
Because my face is the mirror of my heart , the outer surface changed to match the mind within . '' 
`` You are consoled , then ? '' 
said Montalais , sharply . 
`` No , I shall never be consoled . '' 
`` I do n't understand you , M. de Bragelonne . '' 
`` I care but little for that . 
I do not quite understand myself . '' 
`` You have not even tried to speak to Louise ? '' 
`` Who ! 
I ? '' 
exclaimed the young man , with eyes flashing fire ; `` I ! 
- Why do you not advise me to marry her ? 
Perhaps the king would consent now . '' 
And he rose from his chair full of anger . 
`` I see , '' said Montalais , `` that you are not cured , and that Louise has one enemy the more . '' 
`` One enemy the more ! '' 
`` Yes ; favorites are but little beloved at the court of France . '' 
`` Oh ! 
while she has her lover to protect her , is not that enough ? 
She has chosen him of such a quality that her enemies can not prevail against her . '' 
But , stopping all at once , `` And then she has you for a friend , mademoiselle , '' added he , with a shade of irony which did not glide off the cuirass . 
`` Who ! 
I ? 
- Oh , no ! 
I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere condescends to look upon ; but - '' This but , so big with menace and with storm ; this but , which made the heart of Raoul beat , such griefs did it presage for her whom lately he loved so dearly ; this terrible but , so significant in a woman like Montalais , was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by the speakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting . 
Montalais turned to listen , and Raoul was already rising , when a lady entered the room quietly by the secret door , which she closed after her . 
`` Madame ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king . 
`` Stupid wretch ! '' 
murmured Montalais , throwing herself , but too late , before the princess , `` I have been mistaken in an hour ! '' 
She had , however , time to warn the princess , who was walking towards Raoul . 
`` M. de Bragelonne , Madame , '' and at these words the princess drew back , uttering a cry in her turn . 
`` Your royal highness , '' said Montalais , with volubility , `` is kind enough to think of this lottery , and - '' The princess began to lose countenance . 
Raoul hastened his departure , without divining all , but he felt that he was in the way . 
Madame was preparing a word of transition to recover herself , when a closet opened in front of the alcove , and M. de Guiche issued , all radiant , also from that closet . 
The palest of the four , we must admit , was still Raoul . 
The princess , however , was near fainting , and was obliged to lean upon the foot of the bed for support . 
No one ventured to support her . 
This scene occupied several minutes of terrible suspense . 
But Raoul broke it . 
He went up to the count , whose inexpressible emotion made his knees tremble , and taking his hand , `` Dear count , '' said he , `` tell Madame I am too unhappy not to merit pardon ; tell her also that I have loved in the course of my life , and that the horror of the treachery that has been practiced on me renders me inexorable towards all other treachery that may be committed around me . 
This is why , mademoiselle , '' said he , smiling to Montalais , `` I never would divulge the secret of the visits of my friend to your apartment . 
Obtain from Madame - from Madame , who is so clement and so generous , - obtain her pardon for you whom she has just surprised also . 
You are both free , love each other , be happy ! '' 
The princess felt for a moment a despair that can not be described ; it was repugnant to her , notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul had exhibited , to feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered such an indiscretion . 
It was equally repugnant to her to accept the evasion offered by this delicate deception . 
Agitated , nervous , she struggled against the double stings of these two troubles . 
Raoul comprehended her position , and came once more to her aid . 
Bending his knee before her : `` Madame ! '' 
said he , in a low voice , `` in two days I shall be far from Paris ; in a fortnight I shall be far from France , where I shall never be seen again . '' 
`` Are you going away , then ? '' 
said she , with great delight . 
`` With M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` Into Africa ! '' 
cried De Guiche , in his turn . 
`` You , Raoul - oh ! 
my friend - into Africa , where everybody dies ! '' 
And forgetting everything , forgetting that that forgetfulness itself compromised the princess more eloquently than his presence , `` Ingrate ! '' 
said he , `` and you have not even consulted me ! '' 
And he embraced him ; during which time Montalais had led away Madame , and disappeared herself . 
Raoul passed his hand over his brow , and said , with a smile , `` I have been dreaming ! '' 
Then warmly to Guiche , who by degrees absorbed him , `` My friend , '' said he , `` I conceal nothing from you , who are the elected of my heart . 
I am going to seek death in yonder country ; your secret will not remain in my breast more than a year . '' 
`` Oh , Raoul ! 
a man ! '' 
`` Do you know what is my thought , count ? 
This is it - I shall live more vividly , being buried beneath the earth , than I have lived for this month past . 
We are Christians , my friend , and if such sufferings were to continue , I would not be answerable for the safety of my soul . '' 
De Guiche was anxious to raise objections . 
`` Not one word more on my account , '' said Raoul ; `` but advice to you , dear friend ; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Without doubt you risk much more than I do , because you love . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus ! 
Well , then , De Guiche , beware of Montalais . '' 
`` What ! 
of that kind friend ? '' 
`` She was the friend of - her you know of . 
She ruined her by pride . '' 
`` You are mistaken . '' 
`` And now , when she has ruined her , she would ravish from her the only thing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Her love . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of the king - a plot formed in the very house of Madame . '' 
`` Can you think so ? '' 
`` I am certain of it . '' 
`` By Montalais ? '' 
`` Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for - the other ! '' 
`` Explain yourself clearly , my friend ; and if I can understand you - '' `` In two words . 
Madame has been long jealous of the king . '' 
`` I know she has - '' `` Oh ! 
fear nothing - you are beloved - you are beloved , count ; do you feel the value of these three words ? 
They signify that you can raise your head , that you can sleep tranquilly , that you can thank God every minute of you life . 
You are beloved ; that signifies that you may hear everything , even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your happiness . 
You are beloved , De Guiche , you are beloved ! 
You do not endure those atrocious nights , those nights without end , which , with arid eye and fainting heart , others pass through who are destined to die . 
You will live long , if you act like the miser who , bit by bit , crumb by crumb , collects and heaps up diamonds and gold . 
You are beloved ! 
- allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever . '' 
De Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man , half mad with despair , till there passed through his heart something like remorse at his own happiness . 
Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement , to assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man . 
`` They will make her , whose name I should wish still to be able to pronounce - they will make her suffer . 
Swear to me that you will not second them in anything - but that you will defend her when possible , as I would have done myself . '' 
`` I swear I will , '' replied De Guiche . 
`` And , '' continued Raoul , `` some day , when you shall have rendered her a great service - some day when she shall thank you , promise me to say these words to her - ' I have done you this kindness , madame , at the warm request of M. de Bragelonne , whom you so deeply injured . ' '' 
`` I swear I will , '' murmured De Guiche . 
`` That is all . 
Adieu ! 
I set out to-morrow , or the day after , for Toulon . 
If you have a few hours to spare , give them to me . '' 
`` All ! 
all ! '' 
cried the young man . 
`` Thank you ! '' 
`` And what are you going to do now ? '' 
`` I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet 's residence , where we hope to find M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , I wish to embrace him before my departure . 
He is a brave man , who loves me dearly . 
Farewell , my friend ; you are expected , no doubt ; you will find me , when you wish , at the lodgings of the comte . 
Farewell ! '' 
The two young men embraced . 
Those who chanced to see them both thus , would not have hesitated to say , pointing to Raoul , `` That is the happy man ! '' 
: Planchet 's Inventory . 
Athos , during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul , had gone to Planchet 's residence to inquire after D'Artagnan . 
The comte , on arriving at the Rue des Lombards , found the shop of the grocer in great confusion ; but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale , or that of an arrival of goods . 
Planchet was not enthroned , as usual , on sacks and barrels . 
No . 
A young man with a pen behind his ear , and another with an account-book in his hand , were setting down a number of figures , whilst a third counted and weighed . 
An inventory was being taken . 
Athos , who had no knowledge of commercial matters , felt himself a little embarrassed by material obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus employed . 
He saw several customers sent away , and asked himself whether he , who came to buy nothing , would not be more properly deemed importunate . 
He therefore asked very politely if he could see M. Planchet . 
The reply , quite carelessly given , was that M. Planchet was packing his trunks . 
These words surprised Athos . 
`` What ! 
his trunks ? '' 
said he ; `` is M. Planchet going away ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , directly . '' 
`` Then , if you please , inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to speak to him for a moment . '' 
At the mention of the comte 's name , one of the young men , no doubt accustomed to hear it pronounced with respect , immediately went to inform Planchet . 
It was at this moment that Raoul , after his painful scene with Montalais and De Guiche , arrived at the grocer 's house . 
Planchet left his job directly he received the comte 's message . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte ! '' 
exclaimed he , `` how glad I am to see you ! 
What good star brings you here ? '' 
`` My dear Planchet , '' said Athos , pressing the hand of his son , whose sad look he silently observed , - `` we are come to learn of you - But in what confusion do I find you ! 
You are as white as a miller ; where have you been rummaging ? '' 
`` Ah , diable ! 
take care , monsieur ; do n't come near me till I have well shaken myself . '' 
`` What for ? 
Flour or dust only whiten . '' 
`` No , no ; what you see on my arms is arsenic . '' 
`` Arsenic ? '' 
`` Yes ; I am taking my precautions against rats . '' 
`` Ay , I suppose in an establishment like this , rats play a conspicuous part . '' 
`` It is not with this establishment I concern myself , monsieur le comte . 
The rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of again . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Why , you may have observed , monsieur , my inventory is being taken . '' 
`` Are you leaving trade , then ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
mon Dieu ! 
yes . 
I have disposed of my business to one of my young men . '' 
`` Bah ! 
you are rich , then , I suppose ? '' 
`` Monsieur , I have taken a dislike to the city ; I do n't know whether it is because I am growing old , and as M. d'Artagnan one day said , when we grow old we more often think of the adventures of our youth ; but for some time past I have felt myself attracted towards the country and gardening . 
I was a countryman formerly . '' 
And Planchet marked this confession with a rather pretentious laugh for a man making profession of humility . 
Athos made a gesture of approval , and then added : `` You are going to buy an estate , then ? '' 
`` I have bought one , monsieur . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is still better . '' 
`` A little house at Fontainebleau , with something like twenty acres of land round it . '' 
`` Very well , Planchet ! 
Accept my compliments on your acquisition . '' 
`` But , monsieur , we are not comfortable here ; the cursed dust makes you cough . 
Corbleu ! 
I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman in the kingdom . '' 
Athos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed at him , in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness . 
`` Yes , '' said Athos , `` let us have a little talk by ourselves - in your own room , for example . 
You have a room , have you not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur le comte . '' 
`` Upstairs , perhaps ? '' 
And Athos , seeing Planchet a little embarrassed , wished to relieve him by going first . 
`` It is - but - '' said Planchet , hesitating . 
Athos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation , and , attributing it to a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality , `` Never mind , never mind , '' said he , still going up , `` the dwelling of a tradesman in this quarter is not expected to be a palace . 
Come on . '' 
Raoul nimbly preceded him , and entered first . 
Two cries were heard simultaneously - we may say three . 
One of these cries dominated the others ; it emanated from a woman . 
Another proceeded from the mouth of Raoul ; it was an exclamation of surprise . 
He had no sooner uttered it than he shut the door sharply . 
The third was from fright ; it came from Planchet . 
`` I ask your pardon ! '' 
added he ; `` madame is dressing . '' 
Raoul had , no doubt , seen that what Planchet said was true , for he turned round to go downstairs again . 
`` Madame - '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
pardon me , Planchet , I did not know that you had upstairs - '' `` It is Truchen , '' added Planchet , blushing a little . 
`` It is whoever you please , my good Planchet ; but pardon my rudeness . '' 
`` No , no ; go up now , gentlemen . '' 
`` We will do no such thing , '' said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
madame , having notice , has had time - '' `` No , Planchet ; farewell ! '' 
`` Eh , gentlemen ! 
you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the staircase , or by going away without having sat down . '' 
`` If we had known you had a lady upstairs , '' replied Athos , with his customary coolness , `` we would have asked permission to pay our respects to her . '' 
Planchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance , that he forced the passage , and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son . 
Truchen was quite dressed : in the costume of the shopkeeper 's wife , rich yet coquettish ; German eyes attacking French eyes . 
She left the apartment after two courtesies , and went down into the shop - but not without having listened at the door , to know what Planchet 's gentlemen visitors would say of her . 
Athos suspected that , and therefore turned the conversation accordingly . 
Planchet , on his part , was burning to give explanations , which Athos avoided . 
But , as certain tenacities are stronger than others , Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity , translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus . 
So Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing age , and brought good luck to his business , as Ruth did to Boaz . 
`` You want nothing now , then , but heirs to your property . '' 
`` If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres , '' said Planchet . 
`` Humph ! 
you must have one , then , '' said Athos , phlegmatically , `` if only to prevent your little fortune being lost . '' 
This word little fortune placed Planchet in his rank , like the voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a piqueur in the regiment of Piedmont , in which Rochefort had placed him . 
Athos perceived that the grocer would marry Truchen , and , in spite of fate , establish a family . 
This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin . 
Having heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer , `` What is M. d'Artagnan about ? '' 
said he ; `` he is not at the Louvre . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur le comte , Monsieur d'Artagnan has disappeared . '' 
`` Disappeared ! '' 
said Athos , in surprise . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur , we know what that means . '' 
`` But I do not know . '' 
`` Whenever M. d'Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some great affair . '' 
`` Has he said anything to you about it ? '' 
`` Never . '' 
`` You were acquainted with his departure for England formerly , were you not ? '' 
`` On account of the speculation . '' 
said Planchet , heedlessly . 
`` The speculation ! '' 
`` I mean - '' interrupted Planchet , quite confused . 
`` Well , well ; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question ; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you . 
Since the captain of the musketeers is not here , and as we can not learn from you where we are likely to find M. d'Artagnan , we will take our leave of you . 
Au revoir , Planchet , au revoir . 
Let us be gone , Raoul . '' 
`` Monsieur le comte , I wish I were able to tell you - '' `` Oh , not at all ; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion . '' 
This word `` servant '' struck rudely on the ears of the demi-millionnaire Planchet , but natural respect and bonhomie prevailed over pride . 
`` There is nothing indiscreet in telling you , monsieur le comte , M. d'Artagnan came here the other day - '' `` Aha ? '' 
`` And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart . '' 
`` You are right , then , my friend ; say no more about it . '' 
`` And the chart is there as a proof , '' added Planchet , who went to fetch from the neighboring wall , where it was suspended by a twist , forming a triangle with the bar of the window to which it was fastened , the plan consulted by the captain on his last visit to Planchet . 
This plan , which he brought to the comte , was a map of France , upon which the practiced eye of that gentleman discovered an itinerary , marked out with small pins ; wherever a pin was missing , a hole denoted its having been there . 
Athos , by following with his eye the pins and holes , saw that D'Artagnan had taken the direction of the south , and gone as far as the Mediterranean , towards Toulon . 
It was near Cannes that the marks and the punctured places ceased . 
The Comte de la Fere puzzled his brains for some time , to divine what the musketeer could be going to do at Cannes , and what motive could have led him to examine the banks of the Var . 
The reflections of Athos suggested nothing . 
His accustomed perspicacity was at fault . 
Raoul 's researches were not more successful than his father 's . 
`` Never mind , '' said the young man to the comte , who silently , and with his finger , had made him understand the route of D'Artagnan ; `` we must confess that there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our destiny with that of M. d'Artagnan . 
There he is on the coast of Cannes , and you , monsieur , will , at least , conduct me as far as Toulon . 
Be assured that we shall meet with him more easily upon our route than on this map . '' 
Then , taking leave of Planchet , who was scolding his shopmen , even the cousin of Truchen , his successor , the gentlemen set out to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort . 
On leaving the grocer 's shop , they saw a coach , the future depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Truchen and Planchet 's bags of crowns . 
`` Every one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses , '' said Raoul , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Road to Fontainebleau ! '' 
cried Planchet to his coachman . 
: The Inventory of M. de Beaufort . 
To have talked of D'Artagnan with Planchet , to have seen Planchet quit Paris to bury himself in his country retreat , had been for Athos and his son like a last farewell to the noise of the capital - to their life of former days . 
What , in fact , did these men leave behind them - one of whom had exhausted the past age in glory , and the other , the present age in misfortune ? 
Evidently neither of them had anything to ask of his contemporaries . 
They had only to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort , and arrange with him the particulars of departure . 
The duke was lodged magnificently in Paris . 
He had one of those superb establishments pertaining to great fortunes , the like of which certain old men remembered to have seen in all their glory in the times of wasteful liberality of Henry III . 
's reign . 
Then , really , several great nobles were richer than the king . 
They knew it , used it , and never deprived themselves of the pleasure of humiliating his royal majesty when they had an opportunity . 
It was this egotistical aristocracy Richelieu had constrained to contribute , with its blood , its purse , and its duties , to what was from his time styled the king 's service . 
From Louis XI . 
- that terrible mower-down of the great - to Richelieu , how many families had raised their heads ! 
How many , from Richelieu to Louis XIV. , had bowed their heads , never to raise them again ! 
But M. de Beaufort was born a prince , and of a blood which is not shed upon scaffolds , unless by the decree of peoples , - a prince who had kept up a grand style of living . 
How did he maintain his horses , his people , and his table ? 
Nobody knew ; himself less than others . 
Only there were then privileges for the sons of kings , to whom nobody refused to become a creditor , whether from respect or the persuasion that they would some day be paid . 
Athos and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as that of Planchet . 
The duke , likewise , was making his inventory ; that is to say , he was distributing to his friends everything of value he had in his house . 
Owing nearly two millions - an enormous amount in those days - M. de Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for Africa without a good round sum , and , in order to find that sum , he was distributing to his old creditors plate , arms , jewels , and furniture , which was more magnificent in selling it , and brought him back double . 
In fact , how could a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing , refuse to carry away a present worth six thousand , enhanced in estimation from having belonged to a descendant of Henry IV . ? 
And how , after having carried away that present , could he refuse ten thousand livres more to this generous noble ? 
This , then , was what had happened . 
The duke had no longer a dwelling-house - that had become useless to an admiral whose place of residence is his ship ; he had no longer need of superfluous arms , when he was placed amidst his cannons ; no more jewels , which the sea might rob him of ; but he had three or four hundred thousand crowns fresh in his coffers . 
And throughout the house there was a joyous movement of people who believed they were plundering monseigneur . 
The prince had , in a supreme degree , the art of making happy the creditors most to be pitied . 
Every distressed man , every empty purse , found in him patience and sympathy for his position . 
To some he said , `` I wish I had what you have ; I would give it you . '' 
And to others , `` I have but this silver ewer ; it is worth at least five hundred livres , - take it . '' 
The effect of which was - so truly is courtesy a current payment - that the prince constantly found means to renew his creditors . 
This time he used no ceremony ; it might be called a general pillage . 
He gave up everything . 
The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who carried away from the pillage of palace a kettle at the bottom of which was concealed a bag of gold , and whom everybody allowed to pass without jealousy , - this fable had become a truth in the prince 's mansion . 
Many contractors paid themselves upon the offices of the duke . 
Thus , the provision department , who plundered the clothes-presses and the harness-rooms , attached very little value to things which tailors and saddlers set great store by . 
Anxious to carry home to their wives presents given them by monseigneur , many were seen bounding joyously along , under the weight of earthen jars and bottles , gloriously stamped with the arms of the prince . 
M. de Beaufort finished by giving away his horses and the hay from his lofts . 
He made more than thirty happy with kitchen utensils ; and thirty more with the contents of his cellar . 
Still further ; all these people went away with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in this manner to prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs ' tents . 
They repeated to each other , while pillaging his hotel , that he was sent to Gigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes ; that the treasures of Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and the king of France ; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds , or other fabulous stones ; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not even obtain the honor of being named . 
In addition to the mines to be worked -- which could not be begun till after the campaign - there would be the booty made by the army . 
M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on all the riches pirates had robbed Christendom of since the battle of Lepanto . 
The number of millions from these sources defied calculation . 
Why , then , should he , who was going in quest of such treasure , set any store by the poor utensils of his past life ? 
And reciprocally , why should they spare the property of him who spared it so little himself ? 
Such was the position of affairs . 
Athos , with his piercing practiced glance , saw what was going on at once . 
He found the admiral of France a little exalted , for he was rising from a table of fifty covers , at which the guests had drunk long and deeply to the prosperity of the expedition ; at the conclusion of which repast , the remains , with the dessert , had been given to the servants , and the empty dishes and plates to the curious . 
The prince was intoxicated with his ruin and his popularity at one and the same time . 
He had drunk his old wine to the health of his wine of the future . 
When he saw Athos and Raoul : `` There is my aide-de-camp being brought to me ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Come hither , comte ; come hither , vicomte . '' 
Athos tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate . 
`` Ah ! 
step over , step over ! '' 
said the duke , offering a full glass to Athos . 
The latter drank it ; Raoul scarcely moistened his lips . 
`` Here is your commission , '' said the prince to Raoul . 
`` I had prepared it , reckoning upon you . 
You will go before me as far as Antibes . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order . 
`` Do you know anything of the sea ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; I have traveled with M. le Prince . '' 
`` That is well . 
All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to form an escort and carry my provisions . 
The army must be prepared to embark in a fortnight at the very latest . '' 
`` That shall be done , monseigneur . '' 
`` The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles along the coast ; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may want for me . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur le duc . '' 
`` And you are an active man , and will work freely , you will spend much money . '' 
`` I hope not , monseigneur . '' 
`` But I am sure you will . 
My intendant has prepared the orders of a thousand livres , drawn upon the cities of the south ; he will give you a hundred of them . 
Now , dear vicomte , be gone . '' 
Athos interrupted the prince . 
`` Keep your money , monseigneur ; war is to be waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead . '' 
`` I wish to try the contrary , '' replied the duke ; `` and then you are acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition - plenty of noise , plenty of fire , and , if so it must be , I shall disappear in the smoke . '' 
Having spoken thus , M. de Beaufort began to laugh ; but his mirth was not reciprocated by Athos and Raoul . 
He perceived this at once . 
`` Ah , '' said he , with the courteous egotism of his rank and age , `` you are such people as a man should not see after dinner ; you are cold , stiff , and dry when I am all fire , suppleness , and wine . 
No , devil take me ! 
I should always see you fasting , vicomte , and you , comte , if you wear such a face as that , you shall see me no more . '' 
He said this , pressing the hand of Athos , who replied with a smile , `` Monseigneur , do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty of money . 
I predict that within a month you will be dry , stiff , and cold , in presence of your strong-box , and that then , having Raoul at your elbow , fasting , you will be surprised to see him gay , animated , and generous , because he will have some new crowns to offer you . '' 
`` God grant it may be so ! '' 
cried the delighted duke . 
`` Comte , stay with me ! '' 
`` No , I shall go with Raoul ; the mission with which you charge him is a troublesome and difficult one . 
Alone it would be too much for him to execute . 
You do not observe , monseigneur , you have given him command of the first order . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` And in your naval arrangements , too . '' 
`` That may be true . 
But one finds that such fine young fellows as your son generally do all that is required of them . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and intelligence , so much real bravery , as in Raoul ; but if he failed to arrange your embarkation , you would only meet the fate that you deserve . '' 
`` Humph ! 
you are scolding me , then . '' 
`` Monseigneur , to provision a fleet , to assemble a flotilla , to enroll your maritime force , would take an admiral a year . 
Raoul is a cavalry officer , and you allow him a fortnight ! '' 
`` I tell you he will do it . '' 
`` He may ; but I will go and help him . '' 
`` To be sure you will ; I reckoned upon you , and still further believe that when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Athos , shaking his head . 
`` Patience ! 
patience ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , permit us to take our leave . '' 
`` Begone , then , and may my good luck attend you . '' 
`` Adieu ! 
monseigneur ; and may your own good luck attend you likewise . '' 
`` Here is an expedition admirably commenced ! '' 
said Athos to his son . 
`` No provisions - no store flotilla ! 
What can be done , thus ? '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
murmured Raoul ; `` if all are going to do as I am , provisions will not be wanted . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Athos , sternly , `` do not be unjust and senseless in your egotism , or your grief , whichever you please to call it . 
If you set out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein , you stand in need of nobody , and it was scarcely worth while to recommend you to M. de Beaufort . 
But when you have been introduced to the prime commandant - when you have accepted the responsibility of a post in his army , the question is no longer about you , but about all those poor soldiers , who , as well as you , have hearts and bodies , who will weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their condition . 
Remember , Raoul , that officers are ministers as useful to the world as priests , and that they ought to have more charity . '' 
`` Monsieur , I know it and have practiced it ; I would have continued to do so still , but - '' `` You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military glory ; go and die if you like , but do not die without honor and without advantage to France . 
Cheer up , Raoul ! 
do not let my words grieve you ; I love you , and wish to see you perfect . '' 
`` I love your reproaches , monsieur , '' said the young man , mildly ; `` they alone may cure me , because they prove to me that some one loves me still . '' 
`` And now , Raoul , let us be off ; the weather is so fine , the heavens so clear , those heavens which we always find above our heads , which you will see more clear still at Gigelli , and which will speak to you of me there , as they speak to me here of God . '' 
The two gentlemen , after having agreed on this point , talked over the wild freaks of the duke , convinced that France would be served in a very incomplete manner , as regarded both spirit and practice , in the ensuing expedition ; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word vanity , they set forward , in obedience rather to their will than destiny . 
The sacrifice was half accomplished . 
: The Silver Dish . 
The journey passed off pretty well . 
Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon . 
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D'Artagnan . 
His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . 
Athos knew from experience that D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair , whether on his own account or on the service of the king . 
He even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . 
And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the flotilla , and got together the chalands and lighters to send them to Toulon , one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark . 
Athos , believing that this man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish , and so gain more money when all his companions were gone , insisted upon having the details . 
The fisherman informed him that six days previously , a man had come in the night to hire his boat , for the purpose of visiting the island of St. Honnorat . 
The price was agreed upon , but the gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case , which he insisted upon embarking , in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the operation . 
The fisherman wished to retract . 
He had even threatened , but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the gentleman 's cane , which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long . 
Swearing and grumbling , he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes , who administer justice among themselves and protect each other ; but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper , at sight of which the syndic , bowing to the very ground , enjoined obedience from the fisherman , and abused him for having been refractory . 
They then departed with the freight . 
`` But all this does not tell us , '' said Athos , `` how you injured your boat . '' 
`` This is the way . 
I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman desired me ; but he changed his mind , and pretended that I could not pass to the south of the abbey . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
`` Because , monsieur , there is in front of the square tower of the Benedictines , towards the southern point , the bank of the Moines . '' 
`` A rock ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` Level with the water , but below water ; a dangerous passage , yet one I have cleared a thousand times ; the gentleman required me to land him at Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur ! '' 
cried the fisherman , with his Provencal accent , `` a man is a sailor , or he is not ; he knows his course , or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber . 
I was obstinate , and wished to try the channel . 
The gentleman took me by the collar , and told me quietly he would strangle me . 
My mate armed himself with a hatchet , and so did I . 
We had the affront of the night before to pay him out for . 
But the gentleman drew his sword , and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner , that we neither of us could get near him . 
I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head , and I had a right to do so , had n't I , monsieur ? 
for a sailor aboard is master , as a citizen is in his chamber ; I was going , then , in self-defense , to cut the gentleman in two , when , all at once - believe me or not , monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself , I do n't know how , and there came out of it a sort of a phantom , his head covered with a black helmet and a black mask , something terrible to look upon , which came towards me threatening with its fist . '' 
`` And that was - '' said Athos . 
`` That was the devil , monsieur ; for the gentleman , with great glee , cried out , on seeing him : ` Ah ! 
thank you , monseigneur ! ' '' 
`` A most strange story ! '' 
murmured the comte , looking at Raoul . 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
asked the latter of the fisherman . 
`` You must know , monsieur , that two poor men , such as we are , could be no match for two gentlemen ; but when one of them turned out to be the devil , we had no earthly chance ! 
My companion and I did not stop to consult one another ; we made but one jump into the sea , for we were within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore . '' 
`` Well , and then ? '' 
`` Why , and then , monseigneur , as there was a little wind from the southwest , the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Oh ! 
- but the travelers ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
you need not be uneasy about them ! 
It was pretty plain that one was the devil , and protected the other ; for when we recovered the boat , after she got afloat again , instead of finding these two creatures injured by the shock , we found nothing , not even the carriage or the case . '' 
`` Very strange ! 
very strange ! '' 
repeated the comte . 
`` But after that , what did you do , my friend ? '' 
`` I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite 's , who brought my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would have me flogged . '' 
`` What ! 
did the governor himself say so ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; and yet my boat was injured , seriously injured , for the prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite 's , and the carpenter asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it . '' 
`` Very well , '' replied Raoul ; `` you will be exempted from the service . 
Go . '' 
`` We will go to Sainte-Marguerite 's , shall we ? '' 
said the comte to Bragelonne , as the man walked away . 
`` Yes , monsieur , for there is something to be cleared up ; that man does not seem to me to have told the truth . '' 
`` Nor to me either , Raoul . 
The story of the masked man and the carriage having disappeared , may be told to conceal some violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea , to punish him for his persistence in embarking . '' 
`` I formed the same suspicion ; the carriage was more likely to contain property than a man . '' 
`` We shall see to that , Raoul . 
The gentleman very much resembles D'Artagnan ; I recognize his methods of proceeding . 
Alas ! 
we are no longer the young invincibles of former days . 
Who knows whether the hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which the best blades of Europe , balls , and bullets have not been able to do in forty years ? '' 
That same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite 's , on board a chasse - maree come from Toulon under orders . 
The impression they experienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one . 
The island seemed loaded with flowers and fruits . 
In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor . 
Orange , pomegranate , and fig trees bent beneath the weight of their golden or purple fruits . 
All round this garden , in the uncultivated parts , red partridges ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers , and at every step of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the burrow . 
In fact , this fortunate isle was uninhabited . 
Flat , offering nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation , and under the protection of the governor , who went shares with them , smugglers made use of it as a provisional entrepot , at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden . 
With this compromise , the governor was in a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his fortress , in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green . 
The governor was a sort of happy farmer , harvesting wines , figs , oil , and oranges , preserving his citrons and cedrates in the sun of his casemates . 
The fortress , encircled by a deep ditch , its only guardian , arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by terraces covered with moss . 
Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding any one to introduce them to the governor . 
They ended by making their own way into the garden . 
It was at the hottest time of the day . 
Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone . 
The heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises , to envelop all existences ; the rabbit under the broom , the fly under the leaf , slept as the wave did beneath the heavens . 
Athos saw nothing living but a soldier , upon the terrace beneath the second and third court , who was carrying a basket of provisions on his head . 
This man returned almost immediately without his basket , and disappeared in the shade of his sentry-box . 
Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one , and , after having done so , returned to dine himself . 
All at once they heard some one call out , and raising their heads , perceived in the frame of the bars of the window something of a white color , like a hand that was waved backwards and forwards - something shining , like a polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun . 
And before they were able to ascertain what it was , a luminous train , accompanied by a hissing sound in the air , called their attention from the donjon to the ground . 
A second dull noise was heard from the ditch , and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand . 
The hand that had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen , and then disappeared . 
Athos and Raoul , approaching each other , commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate , and they discovered , in characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife , this inscription : `` I am the brother of the king of France - a prisoner to-day - a madman to-morrow . 
French gentlemen and Christians , pray to God for the soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers . '' 
The plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to make out the meaning of these dismal words . 
At the same moment they heard a cry from the top of the donjon . 
Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his head , and forced down that of his father likewise . 
A musket - barrel glittered from the crest of the wall . 
A white smoke floated like a plume from the mouth of the musket , and a ball was flattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen . 
`` Cordieu ! '' 
cried Athos . 
`` What , are people assassinated here ? 
Come down , cowards as you are ! '' 
`` Yes , come down ! '' 
cried Raoul , furiously shaking his fist at the castle . 
One of the assailants - he who was about to fire - replied to these cries by an exclamation of surprise ; and , as his companion , who wished to continue the attack , had re-seized his loaded musket , he who had cried out threw up the weapon , and the ball flew into the air . 
Athos and Raoul , seeing them disappear from the platform , expected they would come down to them , and waited with a firm demeanor . 
Five minutes had not elapsed , when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms , and they showed themselves on the other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand . 
At the head of these men was an officer , whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket . 
The man ordered the soldiers to `` make ready . '' 
`` We are going to be shot ! '' 
cried Raoul ; `` but , sword in hand , at least , let us leap the ditch ! 
We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels , when their muskets are empty . '' 
And , suiting the action to the word , Raoul was springing forward , followed by Athos , when a well-known voice resounded behind them , `` Athos ! 
Raoul ! '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the two gentlemen . 
`` Recover arms ! 
Mordioux ! '' 
cried the captain to the soldiers . 
`` I was sure I could not be mistaken ! '' 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` What ! 
were we to be shot without warning ? '' 
`` It was I who was going to shoot you , and if the governor missed you , I should not have missed you , my dear friends . 
How fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim , instead of firing at the instant I raise my weapon ! 
I thought I recognized you . 
Ah ! 
my dear friends , how fortunate ! '' 
And D'Artagnan wiped his brow , for he had run fast , and emotion with him was not feigned . 
`` How ! '' 
said Athos . 
`` And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress ? '' 
`` In person . '' 
`` And why did he fire at us ? 
What have we done to him ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
You received what the prisoner threw to you ? '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` That plate - the prisoner has written something on it , has he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
I was afraid he had . '' 
And D'Artagnan , with all the marks of mortal disquietude , seized the plate , to read the inscription . 
When he had read it , a fearful pallor spread across his countenance . 
`` Oh ! 
good heavens ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` Silence ! 
- Here is the governor . '' 
`` And what will he do to us ? 
Is it our fault ? '' 
`` It is true , then ? '' 
said Athos , in a subdued voice . 
`` It is true ? '' 
`` Silence ! 
I tell you - silence ! 
If he only believes you can read ; if he only suspects you have understood ; I love you , my dear friends , I would willingly be killed for you , but - '' `` But - '' said Athos and Raoul . 
`` But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from death . 
Silence , then ! 
Silence again ! '' 
The governor came up , having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge . 
`` Well ! '' 
said he to D'Artagnan , `` what stops us ? '' 
`` You are Spaniards - you do not understand a word of French , '' said the captain , eagerly , to his friends in a low voice . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied he , addressing the governor , `` I was right ; these gentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres , last year ; they do n't know a word of French . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , sharply . 
`` And yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan took it out of his hands , effacing the characters with the point of his sword . 
`` How ! '' 
cried the governor , `` what are you doing ? 
I can not read them now ! '' 
`` It is a state secret , '' replied D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and as you know that , according to the king 's orders , it is under the penalty of death any one should penetrate it , I will , if you like , allow you to read it , and have you shot immediately afterwards . '' 
During this apostrophe - half serious , half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the coolest , most unconcerned silence . 
`` But , is it possible , '' said the governor , `` that these gentlemen do not comprehend at least some words ? '' 
`` Suppose they do ! 
If they do understand a few spoken words , it does not follow that they should understand what is written . 
They can not even read Spanish . 
A noble Spaniard , remember , ought never to know how to read . '' 
The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations , but he was still tenacious . 
`` Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress , '' said he . 
`` That I will willingly do . 
I was about to propose it to you . '' 
The fact is , the captain had quite another idea , and would have wished his friends a hundred leagues off . 
But he was obliged to make the best of it . 
He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish , giving them a polite invitation , which they accepted . 
They all turned towards the entrance of the fort , and , the incident being at an end , the eight soldiers returned to their delightful leisure , for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure . 
: Captive and Jailers . 
When they had entered the fort , and whilst the governor was making some preparations for the reception of his guests , `` Come , '' said Athos , `` let us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone . '' 
`` It is simply this , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` I have conducted hither a prisoner , who the king commands shall not be seen . 
You came here , he has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window ; I was at dinner with the governor , I saw the object thrown , and I saw Raoul pick it up . 
It does not take long to understand this . 
I understood it , and I thought you in intelligence with my prisoner . 
And then - '' `` And then - you commanded us to be shot . '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I admit it ; but , if I was the first to seize a musket , fortunately , I was the last to take aim at you . '' 
`` If you had killed me , D'Artagnan , I should have had the good fortune to die for the royal house of France , and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you , its noblest and most loyal defender . '' 
`` What the devil , Athos , do you mean by the royal house ? '' 
stammered D'Artagnan . 
`` You do n't mean that you , a well-informed and sensible man , can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot ? '' 
`` I do believe in it . '' 
`` With so much the more reason , my dear chevalier , from your having orders to kill all those who do believe in it , '' said Raoul . 
`` That is because , '' replied the captain of the musketeers - `` because every calumny , however absurd it may be , has the almost certain chance of becoming popular . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , '' replied Athos , promptly ; `` but because the king is not willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people , and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` Do not talk in such a childish manner , Athos , or I shall begin to think you have lost your senses . 
Besides , explain to me how it is possible Louis XIII . 
should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite . '' 
`` A son whom you have brought hither masked , in a fishing-boat , '' said Athos . 
`` Why not ? '' 
D'Artagnan was brought to a pause . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he ; `` whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ? '' 
`` Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite 's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur . 
Oh ! 
I am acquainted with all that , '' resumed the comte . 
D'Artagnan bit his mustache . 
`` If it were true , '' said he , `` that I had brought hither in a boat and with a carriage a masked prisoner , nothing proves that this prisoner must be a prince - a prince of the house of France . '' 
`` Ask Aramis such riddles , '' replied Athos , coolly . 
`` Aramis , '' cried the musketeer , quite at a stand . 
`` Have you seen Aramis ? '' 
`` After his discomfiture at Vaux , yes ; I have seen Aramis , a fugitive , pursued , bewildered , ruined ; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan 's head sunk on his breast in some confusion . 
`` This is the way , '' said he , `` in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom ! 
A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered fragments ! 
Athos , cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face with me in this affair ! 
for now - '' `` Well , '' said Athos , with his customary mild severity , `` is your secret lost because I know it ? 
Consult your memory , my friend . 
Have I not borne secrets heavier than this ? '' 
`` You have never borne one so dangerous , '' replied D'Artagnan , in a tone of sadness . 
`` I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die , and die unhappily . '' 
`` The will of God be done ! '' 
said Athos , `` but here is your governor . '' 
D'Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . 
The governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards D'Artagnan with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . 
With respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer , and never taking his eye from them . 
Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks , or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage . 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable , if the governor did not believe it to be quite true . 
They rose from the table to repose awhile . 
`` What is this man 's name ? 
I do n't like the looks of him , '' said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish . 
`` De Saint-Mars , '' replied the captain . 
`` He is , then , I suppose , the prince 's jailer ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
how can I tell ? 
I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , not you ! '' 
`` My friend , I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a desert . 
He would like to carry it away , but he can not ; he would like to leave it , but he dares not . 
The king will not dare to recall me , for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do ; he regrets not having me near him , from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person as myself . 
But it will happen as it may please God . '' 
`` But , '' observed Raoul , `` your not being certain proves that your situation here is provisional , and you will return to Paris ? '' 
`` Ask these gentlemen , '' interrupted the governor , `` what was their purpose in coming to Saint-Marguerite ? '' 
`` They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte - Honnorat which is considered curious ; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the island . '' 
`` That is quite at their service , as well as yours , '' replied Saint-Mars . 
D'Artagnan politely thanked him . 
`` When will they depart ? '' 
added the governor . 
`` To-morrow , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds , and left D'Artagnan alone with the pretended Spaniards . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed the musketeer , `` here is a life and a society that suits me very little . 
I command this man , and he bores me , mordioux ! 
Come , let us have a shot or two at the rabbits ; the walk will be beautiful , and not fatiguing . 
The whole island is but a league and a half in length , with the breadth of a league ; a real park . 
Let us try to amuse ourselves . '' 
`` As you please , D'Artagnan ; not for the sake of amusing ourselves , but to gain an opportunity for talking freely . '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign to a soldier , who brought the gentlemen some guns , and then returned to the fort . 
`` And now , '' said the musketeer , `` answer me the question put to you by that black-looking Saint-Mars : what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles ? '' 
`` To bid you farewell . '' 
`` Bid me farewell ! 
What do you mean by that ? 
Is Raoul going anywhere ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` With M. de Beaufort it is , my dear friend . 
You always guess correctly . '' 
`` From habit . '' 
Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation , Raoul , with his head hanging down and his heart oppressed , seated himself on a mossy rock , his gun across his knees , looking at the sea - looking at the heavens , and listening to the voice of his soul ; he allowed the sportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him . 
D'Artagnan remarked his absence . 
`` He has not recovered the blow ? '' 
said he to Athos . 
`` He is struck to death . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your fears exaggerate , I hope . 
Raoul is of a tempered nature . 
Around all hearts as noble as his , there is a second envelope that forms a cuirass . 
The first bleeds , the second resists . '' 
`` No , '' replied Athos , `` Raoul will die of it . '' 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , in a melancholy tone . 
And he did not add a word to this exclamation . 
Then , a minute after , `` Why do you let him go ? '' 
`` Because he insists on going . '' 
`` And why do you not go with him ? '' 
`` Because I could not bear to see him die . '' 
D'Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face . 
`` You know one thing , '' continued the comte , leaning upon the arm of the captain ; `` you know that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things . 
Well ! 
I have an incessant gnawing , insurmountable fear that an hour will come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan ; `` oh ! '' 
`` He will die , I know , I have a perfect conviction of that ; but I would not see him die . '' 
`` How is this , Athos ? 
you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man , you say you have ever seen , of your own D'Artagnan , of that man without an equal , as you formerly called him , and you come and tell him , with your arms folded , that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son , you who have seen all that can be seen in this world ! 
Why have you this fear , Athos ? 
Man upon this earth must expect everything , and ought to face everything . '' 
`` Listen to me , my friend . 
After having worn myself out upon this earth of which you speak , I have preserved but two religions : that of life , friendship , my duty as a father - that of eternity , love , and respect for God . 
Now , I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence -- oh ! 
no , I can not even tell you , D'Artagnan ! '' 
`` Speak , speak , tell me ! '' 
`` I am strong against everything , except against the death of those I love . 
For that only there is no remedy . 
He who dies , gains ; he who sees others die , loses . 
No , this is it - to know that I should no more meet on earth him whom I now behold with joy ; to know that there would nowhere be a D'Artagnan any more , nowhere again be a Raoul , oh ! 
I am old , look you , I have no longer courage ; I pray God to spare me in my weakness ; but if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion , I should curse him . 
A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God , D'Artagnan ; it is enough to once have cursed a king ! '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
sighed D'Artagnan , a little confused by this violent tempest of grief . 
`` Let me speak to him , Athos . 
Who knows ? '' 
`` Try , if you please , but I am convinced you will not succeed . '' 
`` I will not attempt to console him . 
I will serve him . '' 
`` You will ? '' 
`` Doubtless , I will . 
Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity ? 
I will go to him , I tell you . '' 
Athos shook his head , and continued his walk alone , D'Artagnan , cutting across the brambles , rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him . 
`` Well , Raoul ! 
You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I have a kindness to ask of you , '' replied Bragelonne . 
`` Ask it , then . '' 
`` You will some day return to France ? '' 
`` I hope so . '' 
`` Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere ? '' 
`` No , you must not . '' 
`` But I have many things to say to her . '' 
`` Go and say them to her , then . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
`` Pray , what virtue do you attribute to a letter , which your speech might not possess ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . '' 
`` She loves the king , '' said D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and she is an honest girl . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` And you , you whom she abandons , she , perhaps , loves better than she does the king , but after another fashion . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , do you believe she loves the king ? '' 
`` To idolatry . 
Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling . 
You might continue to live near her , and would be her best friend . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a hideous hope . 
`` Will you do so ? '' 
`` It would be base . '' 
`` That is a very absurd word , which would lead me to think slightly of your understanding . 
Please to understand , Raoul , that it is never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force . 
If your heart says to you , ` Go there , or die , ' why go , Raoul . 
Was she base or brave , she whom you loved , in preferring the king to you , the king whom her heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you ? 
No , she was the bravest of women . 
Do , then , as she has done . 
Oblige yourself . 
Do you know one thing of which I am sure , Raoul ? '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Why , that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man - '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Well ! 
you would cease to love her . '' 
`` Then I am decided , my dear D'Artagnan . '' 
`` To set off to see her again ? '' 
`` No ; to set off that I may never see her again . 
I wish to love her forever . '' 
`` Ha ! 
I must confess , '' replied the musketeer , `` that is a conclusion which I was far from expecting . '' 
`` This is what I wish , my friend . 
You will see her again , and you will give her a letter which , if you think proper , will explain to her , as to yourself , what is passing in my heart . 
Read it ; I drew it up last night . 
Something told me I should see you to-day . '' 
He held the letter out , and D'Artagnan read : `` MADEMOISELLE , - You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me . 
You have only been guilty of one fault towards me , that of having left me to believe you loved me . 
This error will cost me my life . 
I pardon you , but I can not pardon myself . 
It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers . 
It will not be so with you , who did not love me , save with anxiety . 
I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love , you would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death , or lessening the esteem I had for you . 
It is much more delightful to me to die , knowing that you are free and satisfied . 
How much , then , will you love me , when you will no longer fear either my presence or reproaches ? 
You will love me , because , however charming a new love may appear to you , God has not made me in anything inferior to him you have chosen , and because my devotedness , my sacrifice , and my painful end will assure me , in your eyes , a certain superiority over him . 
I have allowed to escape , in the candid credulity of my heart , the treasure I possessed . 
Many people tell me that you loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much . 
That idea takes from my mind all bitterness , and leads me only to blame myself . 
You will accept this last farewell , and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished , and where all love endures forever . 
Adieu , mademoiselle . 
If your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood , I would shed that drop . 
I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery ! 
`` RAOUL , VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE . '' 
`` The letter reads very well , '' said the captain . 
`` I have only one fault to find with it . '' 
`` Tell me what that is ! '' 
said Raoul . 
`` Why , it is that it tells everything , except the thing which exhales , like a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart ; except the senseless love which still consumes you . '' 
Raoul grew paler , but remained silent . 
`` Why did you not write simply these words : '' ` MADEMOISELLE , - Instead of cursing you , I love you and I die . ' '' 
`` That is true , '' exclaimed Raoul , with a sinister kind of joy . 
And tearing the letter he had just taken back , he wrote the following words upon a leaf of his tablets : `` To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you , I commit the baseness of writing to you ; and to punish myself for that baseness , I die . '' 
And he signed it . 
`` You will give her these tablets , captain , will you not ? '' 
`` When ? '' 
asked the latter . 
`` On the day , '' said Bragelonne , pointing to the last sentence , `` on the day when you can place a date under these words . '' 
And he sprang away quickly to join Athos , who was returning with slow steps . 
As they re-entered the fort , the sea rose with that rapid , gusty vehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean ; the ill-humor of the element became a tempest . 
Something shapeless , and tossed about violently by the waves , appeared just off the coast . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Athos , - `` a wrecked boat ? '' 
`` No , it is not a boat , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Raoul , `` there is a bark gaining the port rapidly . '' 
`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . '' 
`` Your advice is good , Athos , and I will this night have it carried out , or rather , I will carry it out myself ; but let us go in , for the rain falls heavily , and the lightning is terrific . '' 
As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key , they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by the prisoner . 
Upon a sign from D'Artagnan , they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` You will see . 
Look . 
The prisoner is returning from chapel . '' 
And they saw , by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky , they saw pass gravely , at six paces behind the governor , a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of polished steel , soldered to a helmet of the same nature , which altogether enveloped the whole of his head . 
The fire of the heavens cast red reflections on the polished surface , and these reflections , flying off capriciously , seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate , instead of imprecations . 
In the middle of the gallery , the prisoner stopped for a moment , to contemplate the infinite horizon , to respire the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest , to drink in thirstily the hot rain , and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan . 
`` Come on , monsieur , '' said Saint-Mars , sharply , to the prisoner , for he already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls . 
`` Monsieur , come on ! '' 
`` Say monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , from his corner , with a voice so solemn and terrible , that the governor trembled from head to foot . 
Athos insisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty . 
The prisoner turned round . 
`` Who spoke ? '' 
asked Saint-Mars . 
`` It was I , '' replied D'Artagnan , showing himself promptly . 
`` You know that is the order . '' 
`` Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur , '' said the prisoner in his turn , in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul ; `` call me ACCURSED ! '' 
He passed on , and the iron door croaked after him . 
`` There goes a truly unfortunate man ! '' 
murmured the musketeer in a hollow whisper , pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince . 
: Promises . 
Scarcely had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends , when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him . 
The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea , and which appeared so eager to gain the port , came to Sainte-Marguerite with an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers . 
On opening it , D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king : `` I should think , '' said Louis XIV. , `` you will have completed the execution of my orders , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; return , then , immediately to Paris , and join me at the Louvre . '' 
`` There is the end of my exile ! '' 
cried the musketeer with joy ; `` God be praised , I am no longer a jailer ! '' 
And he showed the letter to Athos . 
`` So , then , you must leave us ? '' 
replied the latter , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Yes , but to meet again , dear friend , seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone with M. de Beaufort , and will prefer his father going back in company with M. d'Artagnan , to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere ; will you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' stammered the latter , with an expression of tender regret . 
`` No , no , my friend , '' interrupted Athos , `` I will never quit Raoul till the day his vessel disappears on the horizon . 
As long as he remains in France he shall not be separated from me . '' 
`` As you please , dear friend ; but we will , at least , leave Sainte - Marguerite together ; take advantage of the bark that will convey me back to Antibes . '' 
`` With all my heart ; we can not too soon be at a distance from this fort , and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now . '' 
The three friends quitted the little isle , after paying their respects to the governor , and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took their farewell of the white walls of the fort . 
D'Artagnan parted from his friend that same night , after having seen fire set to the carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars , according to the advice the captain had given him . 
Before getting on horseback , and after leaving the arms of Athos : `` My friends , '' said he , `` you bear too much resemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post . 
Something warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank . 
Will you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a hundred good muskets ? 
The king will not refuse me , and I will take you with me . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' replied Raoul , pressing his hand with emotion , `` thanks for that offer , which would give us more than we wish , either monsieur le comte or I. I , who am young , stand in need of labor of mind and fatigue of body ; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose . 
You are his best friend . 
I recommend him to your care . 
In watching over him , you are holding both our souls in your hands . '' 
`` I must go ; my horse is all in a fret , '' said D'Artagnan , with whom the most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in conversation . 
`` Come , comte , how many days longer has Raoul to stay here ? '' 
`` Three days at most . '' 
`` And how long will it take you to reach home ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a considerable time , '' replied Athos . 
`` I shall not like the idea of being separated too quickly from Raoul . 
Time will travel too fast of itself to require me to aid it by distance . 
I shall only make half - stages . '' 
`` And why so , my friend ? 
Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly ; and hostelry life does not become a man like you . '' 
`` My friend , I came hither on post-horses ; but I wish to purchase two animals of a superior kind . 
Now , to take them home fresh , it would not be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day . '' 
`` Where is Grimaud ? '' 
`` He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul 's appointments ; and I have left him to sleep . '' 
`` That is , never to come back again , '' D'Artagnan suffered to escape him . 
`` Till we meet again , then , dear Athos - and if you are diligent , I shall embrace you the sooner . '' 
So saying , he put his foot in the stirrup , which Raoul held . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said the young man , embracing him . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , as he got into his saddle . 
His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends . 
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos , near the gates of Antibes , whither D'Artagnan , after his supper , had ordered his horses to be brought . 
The road began to branch off there , white and undulating in the vapors of the night . 
The horse eagerly respired the salt , sharp perfume of the marshes . 
D'Artagnan put him to a trot ; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house . 
All at once they heard the rapid approach of a horse 's steps , and first believed it to be one of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a road . 
But it was really the return of the horseman . 
They uttered a cry of joyous surprise ; and the captain , springing to the ground like a young man , seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul . 
He held them long embraced thus , without speaking a word , or suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him . 
Then , as rapidly as he had come back , he set off again , with a sharp application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the comte , in a low voice , `` alas ! 
alas ! '' 
`` An evil omen ! '' 
on his side , said D'Artagnan to himself , making up for lost time . 
`` I could not smile upon them . 
An evil omen ! '' 
The next day Grimaud was on foot again . 
The service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished . 
The flotilla , sent to Toulon by the exertions of Raoul , had set out , dragging after it in little nutshells , almost invisible , the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in requisition for the service of the fleet . 
The time , so short , which remained for father and son to live together , appeared to go by with double rapidity , like some swift stream that flows towards eternity . 
Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon , which began to be filled with the noise of carriages , with the noise of arms , the noise of neighing horses . 
The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches ; the drummers signalized their strength ; the streets were overflowing with soldiers , servants , and tradespeople . 
The Duc de Beaufort was everywhere , superintending the embarkation with the zeal and interest of a good captain . 
He encouraged the humblest of his companions ; he scolded his lieutenants , even those of the highest rank . 
Artillery , provisions , baggage , he insisted upon seeing all himself . 
He examined the equipment of every soldier ; assured himself of the health and soundness of every horse . 
It was plain that , light , boastful , egotistical , in his hotel , the gentleman became the soldier again - the high noble , a captain - in face of the responsibility he had accepted . 
And yet , it must be admitted that , whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations for departure , it was easy to perceive careless precipitation , and the absence of all the precaution that make the French solider the first soldier in the world , because , in that world , he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral resources . 
All things having satisfied , or appearing to have satisfied , the admiral , he paid his compliments to Raoul , and gave the last orders for sailing , which was ordered the next morning at daybreak . 
He invited the comte had his son to dine with him ; but they , under a pretext of service , kept themselves apart . 
Gaining their hostelry , situated under the trees of the great Place , they took their repast in haste , and Athos led Raoul to the rocks which dominate the city , vast gray mountains , whence the view is infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears , so remote is it , on a level with the rocks themselves . 
The night was fine , as it always is in these happy climes . 
The moon , rising behind the rocks , unrolled a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea . 
In the roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to facilitate the embarkation . 
The sea , loaded with phosphoric light , opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and munitions ; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames ; from every oar dropped liquid diamonds . 
The sailors , rejoicing in the largesses of the admiral , were heard murmuring their slow and artless songs . 
Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot falling into the holds . 
Such harmonies , such a spectacle , oppress the heart like fear , and dilate it like hope . 
All this life speaks of death . 
Athos had seated himself with his son , upon the moss , among the brambles of the promontory . 
Around their heads passed and repassed large bats , carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind chase . 
The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff , bathed in that void which is peopled by vertigo , and provokes to self-annihilation . 
When the moon had risen to its fullest height , caressing with light the neighboring peaks , when the watery mirror was illumined in its full extent , and the little red fires had made their openings in the black masses of every ship , Athos , collecting all his ideas and all his courage , said : `` God has made all these things that we see , Raoul ; He has made us also , - poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe . 
We shine like those fires and those stars ; we sigh like those waves ; we suffer like those great ships , which are worn out in plowing the waves , in obeying the wind that urges them towards an end , as the breath of God blows us towards a port . 
Everything likes to live , Raoul ; and everything seems beautiful to living things . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said Raoul , `` we have before us a beautiful spectacle ! '' 
`` How good D'Artagnan is ! '' 
interrupted Athos , suddenly , `` and what a rare good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as he is ! 
That is what you have missed , Raoul . '' 
`` A friend ! '' 
cried Raoul , `` I have wanted a friend ! '' 
`` M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion , '' resumed the comte , coldly , `` but I believe , in the times in which you live , men are more engaged in their own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours . 
You have sought a secluded life ; that is a great happiness , but you have lost your strength thereby . 
We four , more weaned from those delicate abstractions that constitute your joy , furnished much more resistance when misfortune presented itself . '' 
`` I have not interrupted you , monsieur , to tell you that I had a friend , and that that friend is M. de Guiche . 
Certes , he is good and generous , and moreover he loves me . 
But I have lived under the guardianship of another friendship , monsieur , as precious and as strong as that of which you speak , since it is yours . '' 
`` I have not been a friend for you , Raoul , '' said Athos . 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur , and in what respect not ? '' 
`` Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face , because , sad and severe , alas ! 
I have always cut off for you , without , God knows , wishing to do so , the joyous buds that spring incessantly from the fair tree of youth ; so that at this moment I repent of not having made of you a more expansive , dissipated , animated man . '' 
`` I know why you say that , monsieur . 
No , it is not you who have made me what I am ; it was love , which took me at the time when children only have inclinations ; it is the constancy natural to my character , which with other creatures is but habit . 
I believed that I should always be as I was ; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear , quite straight , bordered with fruits and flowers . 
I had ever watching over me your vigilance and strength . 
I believed myself to be vigilant and strong . 
Nothing prepared me ; I fell once , and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my life . 
It is quite true that I wrecked myself . 
Oh , no , monsieur ! 
you are nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope ! 
No , I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me ; I bless you , and I love you ardently . '' 
`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . '' 
`` I will do all you may command , '' said Raoul , much agitated . 
`` It is not necessary , Raoul , that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into too hazardous enterprises . 
You have gone through your ordeal ; you are known to be a true man under fire . 
Remember that war with Arabs is a war of snares , ambuscades , and assassinations . '' 
`` So it is said , monsieur . '' 
`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults . 
Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you , Raoul ? 
God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters . '' 
`` I am naturally prudent , monsieur , and I have very good fortune , '' said Raoul , with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father ; `` for , '' the young man hastened to add , `` in twenty combats through which I have been , I have only received one scratch . '' 
`` There is in addition , '' said Athos , `` the climate to be dreaded : that is an ugly end , to die of fever ! 
King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague , rather than the fever . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
with sobriety , with reasonable exercise - '' `` I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France . 
You , as his aide - de-camp , will be charged with expediting them , and will be sure not to forget me . '' 
`` No , monsieur , '' said Raoul , almost choked with emotion . 
`` Besides , Raoul , as you are a good Christian , and I am one also , we ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels . 
Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you , on any occasion , you will think of me at once . '' 
`` First and at once ! 
Oh ! 
yes , monsieur . '' 
`` And will call upon me ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` You dream of me sometimes , do you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Every night , monsieur . 
During my early youth I saw you in my dreams , calm and mild , with one hand stretched out over my head , and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - formerly . '' 
`` We love each other too dearly , '' said the comte , `` that from this moment , in which we separate , a portion of both our souls should not travel with one and the other of us , and should not dwell wherever we may dwell . 
Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill . 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting , they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards , as if in indecision or ashamed to be seen . 
It was Grimaud , who in his anxiety had tracked his master , and was there awaiting him . 
`` Oh ! 
my good Grimaud , '' cried Raoul , `` what do you want ? 
You are come to tell us it is time to be gone , have you not ? '' 
`` Alone ? '' 
said Grimaud , addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of reproach , which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled . 
`` Oh ! 
you are right ! '' 
cried the comte . 
`` No , Raoul shall not go alone ; no , he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand to support him , some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved ! '' 
`` I ? '' 
said Grimaud . 
`` You , yes , you ! '' 
cried Raoul , touched to the inmost heart . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Athos , `` you are very old , my good Grimaud . '' 
`` So much the better , '' replied the latter , with an inexpressible depth of feeling and intelligence . 
`` But the embarkation is begun , '' said Raoul , `` and you are not prepared . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Grimaud , showing the keys of his trunks , mixed with those of his young master . 
`` But , '' again objected Raoul , `` you can not leave monsieur le comte thus alone ; monsieur le comte , whom you have never quitted ? '' 
Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul , as if to measure the strength of both . 
The comte uttered not a word . 
`` Monsieur le comte prefers my going , '' said Grimaud . 
`` I do , '' said Athos , by an inclination of the head . 
At that moment the drums suddenly rolled , and the clarions filled the air with their inspiring notes . 
The regiments destined for the expedition began to debouch from the city . 
They advanced to the number of five , each composed of forty companies . 
Royals marched first , distinguished by their white uniform , faced with blue . 
The ordonnance colors , quartered cross-wise , violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs-de - lis , left the white-colored flag , with its fleur-de-lised cross , to dominate the whole . 
Musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders ; pikemen in the center , with their lances , fourteen feet in length , marched gayly towards the transports , which carried them in detail to the ships . 
The regiments of Picardy , Navarre , Normandy , and Royal Vaisseau , followed after . 
M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops . 
He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would take a full hour before he could reach the sea . 
Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach , in order to take his place when the prince embarked . 
Grimaud , boiling with the ardor of a young man , superintended the embarkation of Raoul 's baggage in the admiral 's vessel . 
Athos , with his arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose , absorbed in melancholy meditation , was deaf to every noise around him . 
An officer came quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have him by his side . 
`` Have the kindness to tell the prince , '' said Raoul , `` that I request he will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Athos , `` an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his general . 
Please to tell the prince , monsieur , that the vicomte will join him immediately . '' 
The officer set off at a gallop . 
`` Whether we part here or part there , '' added the comte , `` it is no less a separation . '' 
He carefully brushed the dust from his son 's coat , and passed his hand over his hair as they walked along . 
`` But , Raoul , '' said he , `` you want money . 
M. de Beaufort 's train will be splendid , and I am certain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms , which are very dear things in Africa . 
Now , as you are not actually in the service of the king or M. de Beaufort , and are simply a volunteer , you must not reckon upon either pay or largesse . 
But I should not like you to want for anything at Gigelli . 
Here are two hundred pistoles ; if you would please me , Raoul , spend them . '' 
Raoul pressed the hand of his father , and , at the turning of a street , they saw M. de Beaufort , mounted on a magnificent white genet , which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city . 
The duke called Raoul , and held out his hand to the comte . 
He spoke to him for some time , with such a kindly expression that the heart of the poor father even felt a little comforted . 
It was , however , evident to both father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a punishment . 
There was a terrible moment - that at which , on quitting the sands of the shore , the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their families and friends ; a supreme moment , in which , notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens , the warmth of the sun , of the perfumes of the air , and the rich life that was circulating in their veins , everything appeared black , everything bitter , everything created doubts of Providence , nay , at the most , of God . 
It was customary for the admiral and his suite to embark last ; the cannon waited to announce , with its formidable voice , that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel . 
Athos , forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet , and of his own dignity as a strong man , opened his arms to his son , and pressed him convulsively to his heart . 
`` Accompany us on board , '' said the duke , very much affected ; `` you will gain a good half-hour . '' 
`` No , '' said Athos , `` my farewell has been spoken , I do not wish to voice a second . '' 
`` Then , vicomte , embark - embark quickly ! '' 
added the prince , wishing to spare the tears of these two men , whose hearts were bursting . 
And paternally , tenderly , very much as Porthos might have done , he took Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat , the oars of which , at a signal , immediately were dipped in the waves . 
He himself , forgetful of ceremony , jumped into his boat , and pushed it off with a vigorous foot . 
`` Adieu ! '' 
cried Raoul . 
Athos replied only by a sign , but he felt something burning on his hand : it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud - the last farewell of the faithful dog . 
This kiss given , Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon the stem of a two-oared yawl , which had just been taken in tow by a chaland served by twelve galley-oars . 
Athos seated himself on the mole , stunned , deaf , abandoned . 
Every instant took from him one of the features , one of the shades of the pale face of his son . 
With his arms hanging down , his eyes fixed , his mouth open , he remained confounded with Raoul - in one same look , in one same thought , in one same stupor . 
The sea , by degrees , carried away boats and faces to that distance at which men become nothing but points , - loves , nothing but remembrances . 
Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral 's ship , he saw him lean upon the rail of the deck , and place himself in such a manner as to be always an object in the eye of his father . 
In vain the cannon thundered , in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult , responded to by immense acclamations from the shore ; in vain did the noise deafen the ear of the father , the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations . 
Raoul appeared to him to the last moment ; and the imperceptible atom , passing from black to pale , from pale to white , from white to nothing , disappeared for Athos - disappeared very long after , to all the eyes of the spectators , had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling sails . 
Towards midday , when the sun devoured space , and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of the sea , Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise , and vanish as soon as seen . 
This was the smoke of a cannon , which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the coast of France . 
The point was buried in its turn beneath the sky , and Athos returned with slow and painful step to his deserted hostelry . 
: Among Women . 
D'Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends so much as he would have wished . 
The stoical soldier , the impassive man-at - arms , overcome by fear and sad presentiments , had yielded , for a few moments , to human weakness . 
When , therefore , he had silenced his heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves , turning towards his lackey , a silent servant , always listening , in order to obey the more promptly : `` Rabaud , '' said he , `` mind , we must travel thirty leagues a day . '' 
`` At your pleasure , captain , '' replied Rabaud . 
And from that moment , D'Artagnan , accommodating his action to the pace of the horse , like a true centaur , gave up his thoughts to nothing - that is to say , to everything . 
He asked himself why the king had sent for him back ; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of Raoul . 
As to the first subject , the reply was negative ; he knew right well that the king 's calling him was from necessity . 
He still further knew that Louis XIV . 
must experience an imperious desire for a private conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level with the highest powers of the kingdom . 
But as to saying exactly what the king 's wish was , D'Artagnan found himself completely at a loss . 
The musketeer had no doubts , either , upon the reason which had urged the unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth . 
Philippe , buried forever beneath a mask of steel , exiled to a country where the men seemed little more than slaves of the elements ; Philippe , deprived even of the society of D'Artagnan , who had loaded him with honors and delicate attentions , had nothing more to see than odious specters in this world , and , despair beginning to devour him , he poured himself forth in complaints , in the belief that his revelations would raise up some avenger for him . 
The manner in which the musketeer had been near killing his two best friends , the destiny which had so strangely brought Athos to participate in the great state secret , the farewell of Raoul , the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy death ; all this threw D'Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable predictions and forebodings , which the rapidity of his pace did not dissipate , as it used formerly to do . 
D'Artagnan passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis . 
He saw them both , fugitives , tracked , ruined - laborious architects of fortunes they had lost ; and as the king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and malice , D'Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed . 
Sometimes , ascending hills , when the winded horse breathed hard from his red nostrils , and heaved his flanks , the captain , left to more freedom of thought , reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis , a genius of acumen and intrigue , a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice . 
Soldier , priest , diplomatist ; gallant , avaricious , cunning ; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except as stepping - stones to rise to giddier ends . 
Generous in spirit , if not lofty in heart , he never did ill but for the sake of shining even yet more brilliantly . 
Towards the end of his career , at the moment of reaching the goal , like the patrician Fuscus , he had made a false step upon a plank , and had fallen into the sea . 
But Porthos , good , harmless Porthos ! 
To see Porthos hungry , to see Mousqueton without gold lace , imprisoned , perhaps ; to see Pierrefonds , Bracieux , razed to the very stones , dishonored even to the timber , - these were so many poignant griefs for D'Artagnan , and every time that one of these griefs struck him , he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun . 
Never was the man of spirit subjected to ennui , if his body was exposed to fatigue ; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light , if he had something to engage his mind . 
D'Artagnan , riding fast , thinking as constantly , alighted from his horse in Pairs , fresh and tender in his muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium . 
The king did not expect him so soon , and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon . 
D'Artagnan , instead of riding after the king , as he would formerly have done , took off his boots , had a bath , and waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired . 
He occupied the interval of five hours in taking , as people say , the air of the house , and in arming himself against all ill chances . 
He learned that the king , during the last fortnight , had been gloomy ; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed ; that Monsieur , the king 's brother , was exhibiting a devotional turn ; that Madame had the vapors ; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates . 
He learned that M. Colbert was radiant ; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day , who still did not cure him , and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not usually cure , unless they are political physicians . 
The king , D'Artagnan was told , behaved in the kindest manner to M. Fouquet , and did not allow him to be ever out of his sight ; but the surintendant , touched to the heart , like one of those fine trees a worm has punctured , was declining daily , in spite of the royal smile , that sun of court trees . 
D'Artagnan learned that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had become indispensable to the king ; that the king , during his sporting excursions , if he did not take her with him , wrote to her frequently , no longer verses , but , which was much worse , prose , and that whole pages at a time . 
Thus , as the political Pleiad of the day said , the first king in the world was seen descending from his horse with an ardor beyond compare , and on the crown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases , which M. de Saint-Aignan , aide-de-camp in perpetuity , carried to La Valliere at the risk of foundering his horses . 
During this time , deer and pheasants were left to the free enjoyment of their nature , hunted so lazily that , it was said , the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France . 
D'Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor Raoul , of that desponding letter destined for a woman who passed her life in hoping , and as D'Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally , he resolved to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute 's talk with Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
This was a very easy affair ; while the king was hunting , Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of the galleries of the Palais Royal , exactly where the captain of the musketeers had some guards to inspect . 
D'Artagnan did not doubt that , if he could but open the conversation on Raoul , Louise might give him grounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile ; and hope , or at least consolation for Raoul , in the state of heart in which he had left him , was the sun , was life to two men , who were very dear to our captain . 
He directed his course , therefore , to the spot where he knew he should find Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
D'Artagnan found La Valliere the center of the circle . 
In her apparent solitude , the king 's favorite received , like a queen , more , perhaps , than the queen , a homage of which Madame had been so proud , when all the king 's looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the courtiers . 
D'Artagnan , although no squire of dames , received , nevertheless , civilities and attentions from the ladies ; he was polite , as a brave man always is , and his terrible reputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as admiration among the women . 
On seeing him enter , therefore , they immediately accosted him ; and , as is not unfrequently the case with fair ladies , opened the attack by questions . 
`` Where had he been ? 
What had become of him so long ? 
Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style , to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king 's balcony ? '' 
He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges . 
This set all the ladies laughing . 
Those were times in which everybody traveled , but in which , notwithstanding , a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem often solved by death . 
`` From the land of oranges ? '' 
cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente . 
`` From Spain ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` From Malta ? '' 
echoed Montalais . 
`` Ma foi ! 
You are coming very near , ladies . '' 
`` Is it an island ? '' 
asked La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I will not give you the trouble of seeking any further ; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is , at this moment , embarking for Algiers . '' 
`` Have you seen the army ? '' 
asked several warlike fair ones . 
`` As plainly as I see you , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` And the fleet ? '' 
`` Yes , I saw everything . '' 
`` Have we any of us any friends there ? '' 
said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , coldly , but in a manner to attract attention to a question that was not without its calculated aim . 
`` Why , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes ; there were M. de la Guillotiere , M. de Manchy , M. de Bragelonne - '' La Valliere became pale . 
`` M. de Bragelonne ! '' 
cried the perfidious Athenais . 
`` Eh , what ! 
- is he gone to the wars ? 
- he ! '' 
Montalais trod on her toe , but all in vain . 
`` Do you know what my opinion is ? '' 
continued she , addressing D'Artagnan . 
`` No , mademoiselle ; but I should like very much to know it . '' 
`` My opinion is , then , that all the men who go to this war are desperate , desponding men , whom love has treated ill ; and who go to try if they can not find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been . '' 
Some of the ladies laughed ; La Valliere was evidently confused ; Montalais coughed loud enough to waken the dead . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` you are in error when you speak of black women at Gigelli ; the women there have not jet faces ; it is true they are not white - they are yellow . '' 
`` Yellow ! '' 
exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties . 
`` Eh ! 
do not disparage it . 
I have never seen a finer color to match with black eyes and a coral mouth . '' 
`` So much the better for M. de Bragelonne , '' said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , with persistent malice . 
`` He will make amends for his loss . 
Poor fellow ! '' 
A profound silence followed these words ; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves - treat each other more cruelly than tigers . 
But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy Athenais ; she determined to make her blush likewise . 
Resuming the conversation without pause , `` Do you know , Louise , '' said she , `` that there is a great sin on your conscience ? '' 
`` What sin , mademoiselle ? '' 
stammered the unfortunate girl , looking round her for support , without finding it . 
`` Eh ! 
- why , '' continued Athenais , `` the poor young man was affianced to you ; he loved you ; you cast him off . '' 
`` Well , that is a right which every honest woman has , '' said Montalais , in an affected tone . 
`` When we know we can not constitute the happiness of a man , it is much better to cast him off . '' 
`` Cast him off ! 
or refuse him ! 
- that 's all very well , '' said Athenais , `` but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach herself with . 
The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars ; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with . '' 
Louise pressed her hand over her icy brow . 
`` And if he dies , '' continued her pitiless tormentor , `` you will have killed him . 
That is the sin . '' 
Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? '' 
D'Artagnan made several steps along the gallery , holding Louise on his arm ; then , when they were far enough removed from the others - `` What I had to say to you , mademoiselle , '' replied he , `` Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente has just expressed ; roughly and unkindly , it is true but still in its entirety . '' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die . 
She disappeared at one door , at the moment the king was entering by another . 
The first glance of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress . 
Not perceiving La Valliere , a frown came over his brow ; but as soon as he saw D'Artagnan , who bowed to him - `` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
cried he , `` you have been diligent ! 
I am much pleased with you . '' 
This was the superlative expression of royal satisfaction . 
Many men would have been ready to lay down their lives for such a speech from the king . 
The maids of honor and the courtiers , who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his entrance , drew back , on observing he wished to speak privately with his captain of the musketeers . 
The king led the way out of the gallery , after having again , with his eyes , sought everywhere for La Valliere , whose absence he could not account for . 
The moment they were out of the reach of curious ears , `` Well ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` the prisoner ? '' 
`` Is in his prison , sire . '' 
`` What did he say on the road ? '' 
`` Nothing , sire . '' 
`` What did he do ? '' 
`` There was a moment at which the fisherman - who took me in his boat to Sainte-Marguerite - revolted , and did his best to kill me . 
The - the prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly . '' 
The king became pale . 
`` Enough ! '' 
said he ; and D'Artagnan bowed . 
Louis walked about his cabinet with hasty steps . 
`` Were you at Antibes , '' said he , `` when Monsieur de Beaufort came there ? '' 
`` No , sire ; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
which was followed by a fresh silence . 
`` Whom did you see there ? '' 
`` A great many persons , '' said D'Artagnan , coolly . 
The king perceived he was unwilling to speak . 
`` I have sent for you , monsieur le capitaine , to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at Nantes . '' 
`` At Nantes ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` In Bretagne . '' 
`` Yes , sire , it is in Bretagne . 
Will you majesty make so long a journey as to Nantes ? '' 
`` The States are assembled there , '' replied the king . 
`` I have two demands to make of them : I wish to be there . '' 
`` When shall I set out ? '' 
said the captain . 
`` This evening - to-morrow - to-morrow evening ; for you must stand in need of rest . '' 
`` I have rested , sire . '' 
`` That is well . 
Then between this and to-morrow evening , when you please . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave ; but , perceiving the king very much embarrassed , `` Will you majesty , '' said he , stepping two paces forward , `` take the court with you ? '' 
`` Certainly I shall . '' 
`` Then you majesty will , doubtless , want the musketeers ? '' 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain . 
`` Take a brigade of them , '' replied Louis . 
`` Is that all ? 
Has your majesty no other orders to give me ? '' 
`` No - ah - yes . '' 
`` I am all attention , sire . '' 
`` At the castle of Nantes , which I hear is very ill arranged , you will adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the principal dignitaries I shall take with me . '' 
`` Of the principal ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` For instance , at the door of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And that of M. Letellier ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Of M. de Brienne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And of monsieur le surintendant ? '' 
`` Without doubt . '' 
`` Very well , sire . 
By to-morrow I shall have set out . '' 
`` Oh , yes ; but one more word , Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
At Nantes you will meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres , captain of the guards . 
Be sure that your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive . 
Precedence always belongs to the first comer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And if M. de Gesvres should question you ? '' 
`` Question me , sire ! 
Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question me ? '' 
And the musketeer , turning cavalierly on his heel , disappeared . 
`` To Nantes ! '' 
said he to himself , as he descended from the stairs . 
`` Why did he not dare to say , from thence to Belle-Isle ? '' 
As he reached the great gates , one of M. Brienne 's clerks came running after him , exclaiming , `` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! 
I beg your pardon - '' `` What is the matter , Monsieur Ariste ? '' 
`` The king has desired me to give you this order . '' 
`` Upon your cash-box ? '' 
asked the musketeer . 
`` No , monsieur ; on that of M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan was surprised , but he took the order , which was in the king 's own writing , and was for two hundred pistoles . 
`` What ! '' 
thought he , after having politely thanked M. Brienne 's clerk , `` M. Fouquet is to pay for the journey , then ! 
Mordioux ! 
that is a bit of pure Louis XI . 
Why was not this order on the chest of M. Colbert ? 
He would have paid it with such joy . '' 
And D'Artagnan , faithful to his principle of never letting an order at sight get cold , went straight to the house of M. Fouquet , to receive his two hundred pistoles . 
: The Last Supper . 
The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching departure , for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends . 
From the bottom to the top of the house , the hurry of the servants bearing dishes , and the diligence of the registres , denoted an approaching change in offices and kitchen . 
D'Artagnan , with his order in his hand , presented himself at the offices , when he was told it was too late to pay cash , the chest was closed . 
He only replied : `` On the king 's service . '' 
The clerk , a little put out by the serious air of the captain , replied , that `` that was a very respectable reason , but that the customs of the house were respectable likewise ; and that , in consequence , he begged the bearer to call again next day . '' 
D'Artagnan asked if he could not see M. Fouquet . 
The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with such details , and rudely closed the outer door in the captain 's face . 
But the latter had foreseen this stroke , and placed his boot between the door and the door-case , so that the lock did not catch , and the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor . 
This made him change his tone , and say , with terrified politeness , `` If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le surintendant , he must go to the ante-chambers ; these are the offices , where monseigneur never comes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
very well ! 
Where are they ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan . 
`` On the other side of the court , '' said the clerk , delighted to be free . 
D'Artagnan crossed the court , and fell in with a crowd of servants . 
`` Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour , '' he was answered by a fellow carrying a vermeil dish , in which were three pheasants and twelve quails . 
`` Tell him , '' said the captain , laying hold of the servant by the end of his dish , `` that I am M. d'Artagnan , captain of his majesty 's musketeers . '' 
The fellow uttered a cry of surprise , and disappeared ; D'Artagnan following him slowly . 
He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in the ante-chamber : the latter , a little pale , came hastily out of the dining - room to learn what was the matter . 
D'Artagnan smiled . 
`` There is nothing unpleasant , Monsieur Pelisson ; only a little order to receive the money for . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet 's friend , breathing more freely ; and he took the captain by the hand , and , dragging him behind him , led him into the dining-room , where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant , placed in the center , and buried in the cushions of a fauteuil . 
There were assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet . 
Joyous friends , for the most part faithful , they had not fled their protector at the approach of the storm , and , in spite of the threatening heavens , in spite of the trembling earth , they remained there , smiling , cheerful , as devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity . 
On the left of the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere ; on his right was Madame Fouquet ; as if braving the laws of the world , and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to silence , the two protecting angels of this man united to offer , at the moment of the crisis , the support of their twined arms . 
Madame de Belliere was pale , trembling , and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante , who , with one hand on her husband 's , was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson had gone out to bring D'Artagnan . 
The captain entered at first full of courtesy , and afterwards of admiration , when , with his infallible glance , he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face . 
Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . '' 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness , which filled the hearts of all his friends with terror . 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast . 
`` Ah ! 
then , '' said he , `` perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes ? '' 
`` I do not know whither I am setting out , monseigneur . '' 
`` But , '' said Madame Fouquet , recovered from her fright , `` you are not going so soon , monsieur le capitaine , as not to do us the honor to take a seat with us ? '' 
`` Madame , I should esteem that a great honor done me , but I am so pressed for time , that , you see , I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note . '' 
`` The reply to which shall be gold , '' said Fouquet , making a sign to his intendant , who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the latter , `` I was not uneasy about the payment ; the house is good . '' 
A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet . 
`` Are you in pain ? '' 
asked Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do you feel your attack coming on ? '' 
asked Madame Fouquet . 
`` Neither , thank you both , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Your attack ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , in his turn ; `` are you unwell , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I have a tertian fever , which seized me after the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Caught cold in the grottos , at night , perhaps ? '' 
`` No , no ; nothing but agitation , that was all . '' 
`` The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king , '' said La Fontaine , quietly , without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege . 
`` We can not devote too much heart to the reception of our king , '' said Fouquet , mildly , to his poet . 
`` Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , with perfect frankness and much amenity . 
`` The fact is , monseigneur , that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux . '' 
Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted himself well towards the king , the king had hardly done the like to the minister . 
But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret . 
He alone with Fouquet knew it ; those two men had not , the one the courage to complain , the other the right to accuse . 
The captain , to whom the two hundred pistoles were brought , was about to take his leave , when Fouquet , rising , took a glass of wine , and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` to the health of the king , whatever may happen . '' 
`` And to your health , monseigneur , whatever may happen , '' said D'Artagnan . 
He bowed , with these words of evil omen , to all the company , who rose as soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs . 
`` I , for a moment , thought it was I and not my money he wanted , '' said Fouquet , endeavoring to laugh . 
`` You ! '' 
cried his friends ; `` and what for , in the name of Heaven ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
do not deceive yourselves , my dear brothers in Epicurus , '' said the superintendent ; `` I do not wish to make a comparison between the most humble sinner on the earth , and the God we adore , but remember , he gave one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper , and which was nothing but a farewell dinner , like that which we are making at this moment . '' 
A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table . 
`` Shut the doors , '' said Fouquet , and the servants disappeared . 
`` My friends , '' continued Fouquet , lowering his voice , `` what was I formerly ? 
What am I now ? 
Consult among yourselves and reply . 
A man like me sinks when he does not continue to rise . 
What shall we say , then , when he really sinks ? 
I have no more money , no more credit ; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies , and powerless friends . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried Pelisson . 
`` Since you explain yourself with such frankness , it is our duty to be frank , likewise . 
Yes , you are ruined -- yes , you are hastening to your ruin - stop . 
And , in the first place , what money have we left ? '' 
`` Seven hundred thousand livres , '' said the intendant . 
`` Bread , '' murmured Madame Fouquet . 
`` Relays , '' said Pelisson , `` relays , and fly ! '' 
`` Whither ? '' 
`` To Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly ! '' 
`` If monseigneur flies , '' said Madame Belliere , `` it will be said that he was guilty - was afraid . '' 
`` More than that , it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with me . '' 
`` We will draw up memoirs to justify you , '' said La Fontaine . 
`` Fly ! '' 
`` I will remain , '' said Fouquet . 
`` And , besides , does not everything serve me ? '' 
`` You have Belle-Isle , '' cried the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` And I am naturally going there , when going to Nantes , '' replied the superintendent . 
`` Patience , then , patience ! '' 
`` Before arriving at Nantes , what a distance ! '' 
said Madame Fouquet . 
`` Yes , I know that well , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` But what is to be done there ? 
The king summons me to the States . 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me ; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness . '' 
`` Well , I have discovered the means of reconciling everything , '' cried Pelisson . 
`` You are going to set out for Nantes . '' 
Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise . 
`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened . 
In fact , you will carry your money against all chances ; and , whilst flying , you will only have obeyed the king ; then , reaching the sea , when you like , you will embark for Belle-Isle , and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please you , like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its eyrie . '' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband . 
`` Do so , '' said Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do it ! 
do it ! '' 
cried all his friends . 
`` I will do so , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` This very evening ? '' 
`` In an hour ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune , '' said the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` And , if necessary , we will go and discover a new world , '' added La Fontaine , intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm . 
A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope . 
`` A courier from the king , '' said the master of the ceremonies . 
A profound silence immediately ensued , as if the message brought by this courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment before . 
Every one waited to see what the master would do . 
His brow was streaming with perspiration , and he was really suffering from his fever at that instant . 
He passed into his cabinet , to receive the king 's message . 
There prevailed , as we have said , such a silence in the chambers , and throughout the attendance , that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet , saying , `` That is well , monsieur . '' 
This voice was , however , broken by fatigue , and trembled with emotion . 
An instant after , Fouquet called Gourville , who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation . 
At length , he himself re-appeared among his guests ; but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them ; from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . 
A breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out , his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . 
On seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards Fouquet . 
The latter , looking at Pelisson , leaned upon his wife , and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere . 
`` Well , '' said he , in a voice which had nothing human in it . 
`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . '' 
` LOUIS . '' 
` The present letter is to serve as a receipt . ' '' 
A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment . 
`` Well , '' cried Pelisson , in his turn , `` you have received that letter ? '' 
`` Received it , yes ! '' 
`` What will you do , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , since I have received it . '' 
`` But - '' `` If I have received it , Pelisson , I have paid it , '' said the surintendant , with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present . 
`` You have paid it ! '' 
cried Madame Fouquet . 
`` Then we are ruined ! '' 
`` Come , no useless words , '' interrupted Pelisson . 
`` Next to money , life . 
Monseigneur , to horse ! 
to horse ! '' 
`` What , leave us ! '' 
at once cried both the women , wild with grief . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , in saving yourself , you save us all . 
To horse ! '' 
`` But he can not hold himself on . 
Look at him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
if he takes time to reflect - '' said the intrepid Pelisson . 
`` He is right , '' murmured Fouquet . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Gourville , rushing up the stairs , four steps at once . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
`` I escorted , as you desired , the king 's courier with the money . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
when I arrived at the Palais Royal , I saw - '' `` Take breath , my poor friend , take breath ; you are suffocating . '' 
`` What did you see ? '' 
cried the impatient friends . 
`` I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback , '' said Gourville . 
`` There , then ! '' 
cried every voice at once ; `` there , then ! 
is there an instant to be lost ? '' 
Madame Fouquet rushed downstairs , calling for her horses ; Madame de Belliere flew after her , catching her in her arms , and saying : `` Madame , in the name of his safety , do not betray anything , do not manifest alarm . '' 
Pelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages . 
And , in the meantime , Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends were able to throw into it of gold and silver - the last offering , the pious alms made to misery by poverty . 
The surintendant , dragged along by some , carried by others , was shut up in his carriage . 
Gourville took the reins , and mounted the box . 
Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet , who had fainted . 
Madame de Belliere had more strength , and was well paid for it ; she received Fouquet 's last kiss . 
Pelisson easily explained this precipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned the minister to Nantes . 
: In M. Colbert 's Carriage . 
As Gourville had seen , the king 's musketeers were mounting and following their captain . 
The latter , who did not like to be confined in his proceedings , left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant , and set off on post horses , recommending his men to use all diligence . 
However rapidly they might travel , they could not arrive before him . 
He had time , in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs , to see something which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture . 
He saw M. Colbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage , which was stationed before the door . 
In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the hoods of two women , and being rather curious , he wished to know the names of the ladies hid beneath these hoods . 
To get a glimpse at them , for they kept themselves closely covered up , he urged his horse so near the carriage , that he drove him against the step with such force as to shake everything containing and contained . 
The terrified women uttered , the one a faint cry , by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman , the other an imprecation , in which he recognized the vigor and aplomb that half a century bestows . 
The hoods were thrown back : one of the women was Madame Vanel , the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse . 
D'Artagnan 's eyes were quicker than those of the ladies ; he had seen and known them , whilst they did not recognize him ; and as they laughed at their fright , pressing each other 's hands , - `` Humph ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to friendship than formerly . 
She paying her court to the mistress of M. Colbert ! 
Poor M. Fouquet ! 
that presages you nothing good ! '' 
He rode on . 
M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes . 
Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband 's house , and , left alone with M. Colbert , chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her ride . 
She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation , that dear duchesse , and as she always talked for the ill of others , though ever with a view to her own good , her conversation amused her interlocutor , and did not fail to leave a favorable impression . 
She taught Colbert , who , poor man ! 
was ignorant of the fact , how great a minister he was , and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher . 
She promised to rally around him , when he should become surintendant , all the old nobility of the kingdom , and questioned him as to the preponderance it would be proper to allow La Valliere . 
She praised him , she blamed him , she bewildered him . 
She showed him the secret of so many secrets that , for a moment , Colbert thought he was doing business with the devil . 
She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of to - day , as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday ; and as he asked her very simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant : `` Why do you yourself hate him ? '' 
said she . 
`` Madame , in politics , '' replied he , `` the differences of system oft bring about dissentions between men . 
M. Fouquet always appeared to me to practice a system opposed to the true interests of the king . '' 
She interrupted him . 
- `` I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet . 
The journey the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of him . 
M. Fouquet , for me , is a man gone by - and for you also . '' 
Colbert made no reply . 
`` On his return from Nantes , '' continued the duchesse , `` the king , who is only anxious for a pretext , will find that the States have not behaved well - that they have made too few sacrifices . 
The States will say that the imposts are too heavy , and that the surintendant has ruined them . 
The king will lay all the blame on M. Fouquet , and then - '' `` And then ? '' 
said Colbert . 
`` Oh ! 
he will be disgraced . 
Is not that your opinion ? '' 
Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse , which plainly said : `` If M. Fouquet be only disgraced , you will not be the cause of it . '' 
`` Your place , M. Colbert , '' the duchesse hastened to say , `` must be a high place . 
Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself , after the fall of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` I do not understand , '' said he . 
`` You will understand . 
To what does your ambition aspire ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` It was useless , then , to overthrow the superintendent , Monsieur Colbert . 
It was idle . '' 
`` I had the honor to tell you , madame - '' `` Oh ! 
yes , I know , all about the interest of the king - but , if you please , we will speak of your own . '' 
`` Mine ! 
that is to say , the affairs of his majesty . '' 
`` In short , are you , or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet ? 
Answer without evasion . '' 
`` Madame , I ruin nobody . '' 
`` I am endeavoring to comprehend , then , why you purchased from me the letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet . 
Neither can I conceive why you have laid those letters before the king . '' 
Colbert , half stupefied , looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` I can less easily conceive how you , who received the money , can reproach me on that head - '' `` That is , '' said the old duchesse , `` because we must will that which we wish for , unless we are not able to obtain what we wish . '' 
`` Will ! '' 
said Colbert , quite confounded by such coarse logic . 
`` You are not able , hein ! 
Speak . '' 
`` I am not able , I allow , to destroy certain influences near the king . '' 
`` That fight in favor of M. Fouquet ? 
What are they ? 
Stop , let me help you . '' 
`` Do , madame . '' 
`` La Valliere ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
very little influence ; no knowledge of business , and small means . 
M. Fouquet has paid his court to her . '' 
`` To defend him would be to accuse herself , would it not ? '' 
`` I think it would . '' 
`` There is still another influence , what do you say to that ? '' 
`` Is it considerable ? '' 
`` The queen-mother , perhaps ? '' 
`` Her majesty , the queen-mother , has a weakness for M. Fouquet very prejudicial to her son . '' 
`` Never believe that , '' said the old duchesse , smiling . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Colbert , with incredulity , `` I have often experienced it . '' 
`` Formerly ? '' 
`` Very recently , madame , at Vaux . 
It was she who prevented the king from having M. Fouquet arrested . '' 
`` People do not forever entertain the same opinions , my dear monsieur . 
That which the queen may have wished recently , she would not wish , perhaps , to-day . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
said Colbert , astonished . 
`` Oh ! 
the reason is of very little consequence . '' 
`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? '' 
`` Bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` Well ! 
this M. d'Herblay , who also knew the secret , the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` So hotly pursued , that if he were dead , she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head , to satisfy her he would never speak again . '' 
`` And is that the desire of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` An order is given for it . '' 
`` This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for , madame . '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is well known where he is . '' 
Colbert looked at the duchesse . 
`` Say where , madame . '' 
`` He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` He shall be taken . '' 
It was now the duchesse 's turn to smile . 
`` Do not fancy the capture so easy , '' said she ; `` do not promise it so lightly . '' 
`` Why not , madame ? '' 
`` Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and where you please . '' 
`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? '' 
`` I ? 
- I ask you nothing of the kind ! '' 
`` I thought you did , madame . 
But as I have been mistaken , we will leave him alone ; the king has said nothing about him . '' 
The duchesse bit her nails . 
`` Besides , '' continued Colbert , `` what a poor capture would this bishop be ! 
A bishop game for a king ! 
Oh ! 
no , no ; I will not even take the slightest notice of him . '' 
The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself . 
`` Game for a woman ! '' 
said she . 
`` Is not the queen a woman ? 
If she wishes M. d'Herblay arrested , she has her reasons . 
Besides , is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
never mind that , '' said Colbert . 
`` This man shall be spared , if he is not the enemy of the king . 
Is that displeasing to you ? '' 
`` I say nothing . '' 
`` Yes - you wish to see him in prison , in the Bastile , for instance . '' 
`` I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` I will speak to the king about it ; he will clear up the point . '' 
`` And whilst waiting for that enlightenment , Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes will have escaped . 
I would do so . '' 
`` Escaped ! 
he ! 
and whither should he escape ? 
Europe is ours , in will , if not in fact . '' 
`` He will always find an asylum , monsieur . 
It is evident you know nothing of the man you have to do with . 
You do not know D'Herblay ; you do not know Aramis . 
He was one of those four musketeers who , under the late king , made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble , and who , during the regency , gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin . '' 
`` But , madame , what can he do , unless he has a kingdom to back him ? '' 
`` He has one , monsieur . '' 
`` A kingdom , he ! 
what , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I repeat to you , monsieur , that if he wants a kingdom , he either has it or will have it . '' 
`` Well , as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape , madame , I promise you he shall not escape . '' 
`` Belle-Isle is fortified , M. Colbert , and fortified by him . '' 
`` If Belle-Isle were also defended by him , Belle-Isle is not impregnable ; and if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle , well , madame , the place shall be besieged , and he will be taken . '' 
`` You may be very certain , monsieur , that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily , and you will be magnificently rewarded ; but what shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man ? '' 
`` That when once taken , he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape . '' 
`` Very well , Monsieur Colbert , and we may say , that , dating from this instant , we have formed a solid alliance , that is , you and I , and that I am absolutely at your service . '' 
`` It is I , madame , who place myself at yours . 
This Chevalier d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy , is he not ? '' 
`` Much more . '' 
`` A secret ambassador ? '' 
`` Higher still . '' 
`` Stop - King Phillip III . 
of Spain is a bigot . 
He is , perhaps , the confessor of Phillip III . '' 
`` You must go higher even than that . '' 
`` Mordieu ! '' 
cried Colbert , who forgot himself so far as to swear in the presence of this great lady , of this old friend of the queen-mother . 
`` He must then be the general of the Jesuits . '' 
`` I believe you have guessed it at last , '' replied the duchesse . 
`` Ah ! 
then , madame , this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him ; and we must make haste , too . '' 
`` Such was my opinion , monsieur , but I did not dare to give it you . '' 
`` And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne , and not us . '' 
`` But , mark this well , M. Colbert . 
M. d'Herblay is never discouraged ; if he has missed one blow , he will be sure to make another ; he will begin again . 
If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for himself , sooner or later , he will make another , of whom , to a certainty , you will not be prime minister . '' 
Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression . 
`` I feel assured that a prison will settle this affair for us , madame , in a manner satisfactory for both . '' 
The duchesse smiled again . 
`` Oh ! 
if you knew , '' said she , `` how many times Aramis has got out of prison ! '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied Colbert , `` we will take care that he shall not get out this time . '' 
`` But you were not attending to what I said to you just now . 
Do you remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so dreaded ? 
And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and experience . '' 
Colbert bit his lips . 
`` We will renounce the idea of the prison , '' said he , in a lower tone : `` we will find a little retreat from which the invincible can not possibly escape . '' 
`` That was well spoken , our ally ! '' 
replied the duchesse . 
`` But it is getting late ; had we not better return ? '' 
`` The more willingly , madame , from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king . '' 
`` To Paris ! '' 
cried the duchesse to the coachman . 
And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine , after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet , the last defender of Belle-Isle , the former friend of Marie Michon , the new foe of the old duchesse . 
: The Two Lighters . 
D'Artagnan had set off ; Fouquet likewise was gone , and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends . 
The first moments of this journey , or better say , this flight , were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive . 
It was not natural , in fact , if Louis XIV . 
was determined to seize this prey , that he should allow it to escape ; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase , and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted . 
But insensibly all fears were dispersed ; the surintendant , by hard traveling , placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors , that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him . 
As to his position , his friends had made it excellent for him . 
Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy . 
The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port . 
You see , besides , that no one is watching you , no one is following . '' 
He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance , behind an elbow formed by the river , the masts of a huge lighter coming down . 
The rowers of Fouquet 's boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` The matter is , monseigneur , '' replied the patron of the bark , `` that it is a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane . '' 
Gourville started , and mounted to the deck , in order to obtain a better view . 
Fouquet did not go up with him , but said to Gourville , with restrained mistrust : `` See what it is , dear friend . '' 
The lighter had just passed the elbow . 
It came on so fast , that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day . 
`` How they go , '' repeated the skipper , `` how they go ! 
They must be well paid ! 
I did not think , '' he added , `` that oars of wood could behave better than ours , but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary . '' 
`` Well they may , '' said one of the rowers , `` they are twelve , and we but eight . '' 
`` Twelve rowers ! '' 
replied Gourville , `` twelve ! 
impossible . '' 
The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded , even for the king . 
This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant , more for the sake of haste than of respect . 
`` What does it mean ? '' 
said Gourville , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent , which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering . 
`` They must be in a hurry , for it is not the king , '' said the patron . 
Fouquet shuddered . 
`` By what sign do you know that it is not the king ? '' 
said Gourville . 
`` In the first place , because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis , which the royal lighter always carries . '' 
`` And then , '' said Fouquet , `` because it is impossible it should be the king , Gourville , as the king was still in Paris yesterday . '' 
Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said : `` You were there yourself yesterday . '' 
`` And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste ? '' 
added he , for the sake of gaining time . 
`` By this , monsieur , '' said the patron ; `` these people must have set out a long while after us , and they have already nearly overtaken us . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Gourville , `` who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even ? '' 
`` We have seen no lighter of that shape , except at Orleans . 
It comes from Orleans , monsieur , and makes great haste . '' 
Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! '' 
`` No , '' said Fouquet , `` on the contrary ; stop short . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
what folly ! '' 
interrupted Gourville , stooping towards his ear . 
`` Pull up ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
The eight oars stopped , and resisting the water , created a retrograde motion . 
It stopped . 
The twelve rowers in the other did not , at first , perceive this maneuver , for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket - shot . 
Fouquet was short-sighted , Gourville was annoyed by the sun , now full in his eyes ; the skipper alone , with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements , perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter . 
`` I can see them ! '' 
cried he ; `` there are two . '' 
`` I can see nothing , '' said Gourville . 
`` You will not be long before you distinguish them ; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us . '' 
But what the patron announced was not realized ; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet , and instead of coming to join its pretended friends , it stopped short in the middle of the river . 
`` I can not comprehend this , '' said the captain . 
`` Nor I , '' cried Gourville . 
`` You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter , '' resumed Fouquet , `` try to describe them to us , before we are too far off . '' 
`` I thought I saw two , '' replied the boatman . 
`` I can only see one now , under the tent . '' 
`` What sort of man is he ? '' 
`` He is a dark man , broad-shouldered , bull-necked . '' 
A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure , darkening the sun . 
Gourville , who was still looking , with one hand over his eyes , became able to see what he sought , and all at once , jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him : `` Colbert ! '' 
said he , in a voice broken by emotion . 
`` Colbert ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` Too strange ! 
but no , it is impossible ! '' 
`` I tell you I recognized him , and he , at the same time , so plainly recognized me , that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop . 
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track . '' 
`` In that case he would join us , instead of lying by . 
What is he doing there ? '' 
`` He is watching us , without a doubt . '' 
`` I do not like uncertainty , '' said Fouquet ; `` let us go straight up to him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , do not do that , the lighter is full of armed men . '' 
`` He wishes to arrest me , then , Gourville ? 
Why does he not come on ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin . '' 
`` But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor ! '' 
`` Nothing yet proves that they are watching you , monseigneur ; be patient ! '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` Do not stop ; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king 's order with zeal . 
Redouble the speed . 
He who lives will see ! '' 
`` That is better . 
Come ! '' 
cried Fouquet ; `` since they remain stock-still yonder , let us go on . '' 
The captain gave the signal , and Fouquet 's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested . 
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ? 
Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! ' 
Well ! 
M. Colbert takes care not to pass me . 
He is a prudent man is M. Colbert . '' 
He was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes , watching each other . 
When the surintendant landed , Gourville hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once , and have the relays prepared . 
But , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first , and Colbert , approaching Fouquet , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect - marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse . 
Fouquet was completely self-possessed ; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself . 
He wished to fall from such a height that his fall should crush some of his enemies . 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert . 
The surintendant , therefore , coming up to him , replied , with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him - `` What ! 
is that you , M. Colbert ? '' 
`` To offer you my respects , monseigneur , '' said the latter . 
`` Were you in that lighter ? '' 
- pointing to the one with twelve rowers . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Of twelve rowers ? '' 
said Fouquet ; `` what luxury , M. Colbert . 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
- and Colbert blushed . 
`` This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear , Monsieur l'Intendant ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` But you have , happily , arrived ! 
-- You see , however , '' added he , a moment after , `` that I , who had but eight rowers , arrived before you . '' 
And he turned his back towards him , leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first . 
At least he did not give him the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened . 
Colbert , so annoyingly attacked , did not give way . 
`` I have not been quick , monseigneur , '' he replied , `` because I followed your example whenever you stopped . '' 
`` And why did you do that , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
cried Fouquet , irritated by the base audacity ; `` as you had a superior crew to mine , why did you not either join me or pass me ? '' 
`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . '' 
`` Bon jour ! 
monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer ; `` how did you get through the journey ? '' 
`` Tolerably well , thank you . '' 
`` And the fever ? '' 
`` But poorly . 
I drink , as you perceive . 
I am scarcely arrived , and I have already levied a contribution of tisane upon Nantes . '' 
`` You should sleep first , monseigneur . '' 
`` Eh ! 
corbleu ! 
my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , I should be very glad to sleep . '' 
`` Who hinders you ? '' 
`` Why , you in the first place . '' 
`` I ? 
Oh , monseigneur ! '' 
`` No doubt you do . 
Is it at Nantes as at Paris ? 
Do you not come in the king 's name ? '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , monseigneur , '' replied the captain , `` leave the king alone ! 
The day on which I shall come on the part of the king , for the purpose you mean , take my word for it , I will not leave you long in doubt . 
You will see me place my hand on my sword , according to the ordonnance , and you will hear my say at once , in ceremonial voice , ` Monseigneur , in the name of the king , I arrest you ! ' '' 
`` You promise me that frankness ? '' 
said the superintendent . 
`` Upon my honor ! 
But we have not come to that , believe me . '' 
`` What makes you think that , M. d'Artagnan ? 
For my part , I think quite the contrary . '' 
`` I have heard speak of nothing of the kind , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Indeed , no . 
You are an agreeable man , in spite of your fever . 
The king should not , can not help loving you , at the bottom of his heart . '' 
Fouquet 's expression implied doubt . 
`` But M. Colbert ? '' 
said he ; `` does M. Colbert love me as much as you say ? '' 
`` I am not speaking of M. Colbert , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He is an exceptional man . 
He does not love you ; so much is very possible ; but , mordioux ! 
the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little trouble . '' 
`` Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend ? '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` and that , upon my life ! 
I have never met with a man of your intelligence , and heart ? '' 
`` You are pleased to say so , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Why did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment ? '' 
`` Blind that we are ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Your voice is getting hoarse , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` drink , monseigneur , drink ! '' 
And he offered him a cup of tisane , with the most friendly cordiality ; Fouquet took it , and thanked him by a gentle smile . 
`` Such things only happen to me , '' said the musketeer . 
`` I have passed ten years under your very beard , while you were rolling about tons of gold . 
You were clearing an annual pension of four millions ; you never observed me ; and you find out there is such a person in the world , just at the moment you - '' `` Just at the moment I am about to fall , '' interrupted Fouquet . 
`` That is true , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` But you thought so ; and that is the same thing . 
Well ! 
if I fall , take my word as truth , I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself , as I strike my brow , ` Fool ! 
fool ! 
- stupid mortal ! 
You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand , and you did not employ him , you did not enrich him ! ' '' 
`` You overwhelm me , '' said the captain . 
`` I esteem you greatly . '' 
`` There exists another man , then , who does not think as M. Colbert thinks , '' said the surintendant . 
`` How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination ! 
He is worse than fever ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have good cause , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Judge for yourself . '' 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters , and the hypocritical persecution of Colbert . 
`` Is not this a clear sign of my ruin ? '' 
D'Artagnan became very serious . 
`` That is true , '' he said . 
`` Yes ; it has an unsavory odor , as M. de Treville used to say . '' 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look . 
`` Am I not clearly designated in that , captain ? 
Is not the king bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris , where I have so many creatures , and to possess himself of Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` Where M. d'Herblay is , '' added D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet raised his head . 
`` As for me , monseigneur , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I can assure you the king has said nothing to me against you . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` The king commanded me to set out for Nantes , it is true ; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres . '' 
`` My friend . '' 
`` To M. de Gesvres , yes , monseigneur , '' continued the musketeer , whose eye s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips . 
`` The king , moreover , commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers , which is apparently superfluous , as the country is quite quiet . '' 
`` A brigade ! '' 
said Fouquet , raising himself upon his elbow . 
`` Ninety-six horsemen , yes , monseigneur . 
The same number as were employed in arresting MM . 
de Chalais , de Cinq-Mars , and Montmorency . '' 
Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? '' 
`` I ? 
- to what end ? 
Are you threatened ? 
Only there really is an order with respect to carriages and boats - '' `` An order ? '' 
`` Yes ; but it can not concern you - a simple measure of police . '' 
`` What is it , captain ? 
- what is it ? '' 
`` To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes , without a pass , signed by the king . '' 
`` Great God ! 
but - '' D'Artagnan began to laugh . 
`` All that is not to be put into execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes . 
So that you see plainly , monseigneur , the order in nowise concerns you . '' 
Fouquet became thoughtful , and D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation . 
`` It is evident , by my thus confiding to you the orders which have been given to me , that I am friendly towards you , and that I am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you . '' 
`` Without doubt ! 
- without doubt ! '' 
said Fouquet , still absent . 
`` Let us recapitulate , '' said the captain , his glance beaming with earnestness . 
`` A special guard about the castle , in which your lodging is to be , is it not ? '' 
`` Do you know the castle ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment . 
He had not reached the steps of the vestibule , when Fouquet , quite beside himself , hung to the bell-rope , and shouted , `` My horses ! 
- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale . 
`` Let us be gone ! 
Let us be gone ! '' 
cried Fouquet , as soon as he saw him . 
`` It is too late ! '' 
said the surintendant 's poor friend . 
`` Too late ! 
- why ? '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the castle . 
`` What does that mean , Gourville ? '' 
`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup . 
D'Artagnan , when the king had passed under the arch , directed his steps towards the house Fouquet was in ; but so slowly , and stopping so frequently to speak to his musketeers , drawn up like a hedge , that it might be said he was counting the seconds , or the steps , before accomplishing his object . 
Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the court . 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , on perceiving him , `` are you still there , monseigneur ? '' 
And that word still completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had paid him . 
The surintendant sighed deeply . 
`` Good heavens ! 
yes , monsieur , '' replied he . 
`` The arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed . '' 
`` Oh , then you know that the king has arrived ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , I have seen him ; and this time you come from him - '' `` To inquire after you , monseigneur ; and , if your health is not too bad , to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle . '' 
`` Directly , Monsieur d'Artagnan , directly ! '' 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
said the captain , `` now the king is come , there is no more walking for anybody - no more free will ; the password governs all now , you as much as me , me as much as you . '' 
Fouquet heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage , so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by D'Artagnan , whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . 
: How the King , Louis XIV. , Played His Little Part . 
As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of Nantes , a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect , and gave him a letter . 
D'Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet , and pushed him away , but the message had been given to the surintendant . 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it , and instantly a vague terror , which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate , was painted on the countenance of the first minister . 
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm , and passed on towards the king 's apartments . 
D'Artagnan , through the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs , saw , as he went up behind Fouquet , the man who had delivered the note , looking round him on the place and making signs to several persons , who disappeared in the adjacent streets , after having themselves repeated the signals . 
Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken , - a terrace which abutted on the little corridor , at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located . 
Here D'Artagnan passed on before the surintendant , whom , till that time , he had respectfully accompanied , and entered the royal cabinet . 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Louis XIV. , who , on perceiving him , threw on to the table covered with papers a large green cloth . 
`` The order is executed , sire . '' 
`` And Fouquet ? '' 
`` Monsieur le surintendant follows me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` In ten minutes let him be introduced , '' said the king , dismissing D'Artagnan again with a gesture . 
The latter retired ; but had scarcely reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for him , when he was recalled by the king 's bell . 
`` Did he not appear astonished ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Who , sire ? '' 
`` Fouquet , '' replied the king , without saying monsieur , a peculiarity which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions . 
`` No , sire , '' replied he . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
And a second time Louis dismissed D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide . 
He reperused his note , conceived thus : `` Something is being contrived against you . 
Perhaps they will not dare to carry it out at the castle ; it will be on your return home . 
The house is already surrounded by musketeers . 
Do not enter . 
A white horse is in waiting for you behind the esplanade ! '' 
Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville . 
Not being willing that , if any evil happened to himself , this paper should compromise a faithful friend , the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand morsels , spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace . 
D'Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps in space . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` the king awaits you . '' 
Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor , where MM . 
de Brienne and Rose were at work , whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan , seated on a chair , likewise in the corridor , appeared to be waiting for orders , with feverish impatience , his sword between his legs . 
It appeared strange to Fouquet that MM . 
Brienne , Rose , and de Saint-Aignan , in general so attentive and obsequious , should scarcely take the least notice , as he , the surintendant , passed . 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers , he whom the king no longer called anything but Fouquet ? 
He raised his head , determined to look every one and everything bravely in the face , and entered the king 's apartment , where a little bell , which we already know , had already announced him to his majesty . 
The king , without rising , nodded to him , and with interest : `` Well ! 
how are you , Monsieur Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am in a high fever , '' replied the surintendant ; `` but I am at the king 's service . '' 
`` That is well ; the States assemble to-morrow ; have you a speech ready ? '' 
Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment . 
`` I have not , sire , '' replied he ; `` but I will improvise one . 
I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . '' 
The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? '' 
`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . '' 
`` Rest yourself , Monsieur Fouquet , do not throw away your strength ; the session of the States will be short , and when my secretaries shall have closed it , I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a fortnight . '' 
`` Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the States ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` Not to me , the surintendant of the finances ? '' 
`` Rest yourself , I beg you ; that is all I have to say to you . '' 
Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head . 
He was evidently busy with some uneasy thought . 
This uneasiness struck the king . 
`` Are you angry at having to rest yourself , M. Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , sire , I am not accustomed to take rest . '' 
`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he . 
`` If his first word is severe , '' again thought Fouquet ; `` if he becomes angry , or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext , how shall I extricate myself ? 
Let us smooth the declivity a little . 
Gourville was right . '' 
`` Sire , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the point of dispensing with my labor , may I not be allowed to be absent from the council of to-morrow ? 
I could pass the day in bed , and will entreat the king to grant me his physician , that we may endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever . '' 
`` So be it , Monsieur Fouquet , it shall be as you desire ; you shall have a holiday to-morrow , you shall have the physician , and shall be restored to health . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
said Fouquet , bowing . 
Then , opening his game : `` Shall I not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle - Isle ? '' 
And he looked Louis full in the face , to judge of the effect of such a proposal . 
The king blushed again . 
`` Do you know , '' replied he , endeavoring to smile , `` that you have just said , ` My residence of Belle-Isle ' ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Well ! 
do you not remember , '' continued the king in the same cheerful tone , `` that you gave me Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` That is true again , sire . 
Only , as you have not taken it , you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it . '' 
`` I mean to do so . '' 
`` That was , besides , your majesty 's intention as well as mine ; and I can not express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the king 's regiments from Paris to help take possession . '' 
The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that alone . 
`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . '' 
`` You have a boat of your own , nevertheless ? '' 
`` I have five ; but they are all in port , or at Paimboeuf ; and to join them , or bring them hither , would require at least twenty-four hours . 
Have I any occasion to send a courier ? 
Must I do so ? '' 
`` Wait a little , put an end to the fever , - wait till to-morrow . '' 
`` That is true . 
Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred other ideas ? '' 
replied Fouquet , now perfectly convinced and very pale . 
The king started , and stretched his hand out towards his little bell , but Fouquet prevented his ringing . 
`` Sire , '' said he , `` I have an ague - I am trembling with cold . 
If I remain a moment longer , I shall most likely faint . 
I request your majesty 's permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes . '' 
`` Indeed , you are in a shiver ; it is painful to behold ! 
Come , Monsieur Fouquet , begone ! 
I will send to inquire after you . '' 
`` Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness . 
In an hour I shall be better . '' 
`` I will call some one to reconduct you , '' said the king . 
`` As you please , sire ; I would gladly take the arm of any one . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , ringing his little bell . 
`` Oh , sire , '' interrupted Fouquet , laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold , `` would you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings ? 
An equivocal honor that , sire ! 
A simple footman , I beg . '' 
`` And why , M. Fouquet ? 
M. d'Artagnan conducts me often , and extremely well ! '' 
`` Yes , but when he conducts you , sire , it is to obey you ; whilst me - '' `` Go on ! '' 
`` If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers , it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
replied the king , who became paler than Fouquet himself , - `` arrested ! 
oh ! '' 
`` And why should they not say so ? '' 
continued Fouquet , still laughing ; `` and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it . '' 
This sally disconcerted the monarch . 
Fouquet was skillful enough , or fortunate enough , to make Louis XIV . 
recoil before the appearance of the deed he meditated . 
M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed , without at all comprehending what was going on . 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment , affecting all the slowness of a man who walks with difficulty . 
When once out of the castle , `` I am saved ! '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , disloyal king , you shall see Belle-Isle , but it shall be when I am no longer there . '' 
He disappeared , leaving D'Artagnan with the king . 
`` Captain , '' said the king , `` you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` He is going to his lodgings again . 
You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . '' 
`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed . 
`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . '' 
`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by . 
So much the worse ! 
Now I have orders , I will obey those orders , and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested . 
He is at the castle of Angers , this very M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you have not got him yet , captain . '' 
`` That concerns me ; every one to his trade , sire ; only , once more , reflect ! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet , sire ? '' 
`` Yes , a thousand times , yes ! '' 
`` In writing , sire , then . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
D'Artagnan read it , bowed to the king , and left the room . 
From the height of the terrace he perceived Gourville , who went by with a joyous air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
: The White Horse and the Black . 
`` That is rather surprising , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` Gourville running about the streets so gayly , when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger ; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace , and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant . 
Gourville is rubbing his hands ; that is because he has done something clever . 
Whence comes M. Gourville ? 
Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes . 
Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead ? '' 
And D'Artagnan followed , along the tops of the houses of Nantes , dominated by the castle , the line traced by the streets , as he would have done upon a topographical plan ; only , instead of the dead , flat paper , the living chart rose in relief with the cries , the movements , and the shadows of men and things . 
Beyond the inclosure of the city , the great verdant plains stretched out , bordering the Loire , and appeared to run towards the pink horizon , which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of the marshes . 
Immediately outside the gates of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic hand . 
D'Artagnan , who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by crossing the terrace , was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of Nantes . 
One step more , and he was about to descend the stairs , take his trellised carriage , and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
But chance decreed , at the moment of plunging into the staircase , that he was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said the musketeer to himself ; `` a horse galloping , - a runaway horse , no doubt . 
What a rate he is going at ! '' 
The moving point became detached from the road , and entered into the fields . 
`` A white horse , '' continued the captain , who had just observed the color thrown luminously against the dark ground , `` and he is mounted ; it must be some boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him . '' 
These reflections , rapid as lightning , simultaneous with visual perception , D'Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first steps of the staircase . 
Some morsels of paper were spread over the stairs , and shone out white against the dirty stones . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the captain to himself , `` here are some of the fragments of the note torn by M. Fouquet . 
Poor man ! 
he has given his secret to the wind ; the wind will have no more to do with it , and brings it back to the king . 
Decidedly , Fouquet , you play with misfortune ! 
the game is not a fair one , - fortune is against you . 
The star of Louis XIV . 
obscures yours ; the adder is stronger and more cunning than the squirrel . '' 
D'Artagnan picked up one of these morsels of paper as he descended . 
`` Gourville 's pretty little hand ! '' 
cried he , whilst examining one of the fragments of the note ; `` I was not mistaken . '' 
And he read the word `` horse . '' 
`` Stop ! '' 
said he ; and he examined another , upon which there was not a letter traced . 
Upon a third he read the word `` white ; '' `` white horse , '' repeated he , like a child that is spelling . 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
cried the suspicious spirit , `` a white horse ! '' 
And , like that grain of powder which , burning , dilates into ten thousand times its volume , D'Artagnan , enlightened by ideas and suspicions , rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace . 
The white horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire , at the extremity of which , melting into the vapors of the water , a little sail appeared , wave-balanced like a water-butterfly . 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried the musketeer , `` only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across plowed lands ; there is but one Fouquet , a financier , to ride thus in open day upon a white horse ; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make his escape towards the sea , while there are such thick forests on land , and there is but one D'Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet , who has half an hour 's start , and who will have gained his boat within an hour . '' 
This being said , the musketeer gave orders that the carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a thicket situated just outside the city . 
He selected his best horse , jumped upon his back , galloped along the Rue aux Herbes , taking , not the road Fouquet had taken , but the bank itself of the Loire , certain that he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance , and , at the intersection of the two lines , come up with the fugitive , who could have no suspicion of being pursued in that direction . 
In the rapidity of the pursuit , and with the impatience of the avenger , animating himself as in war , D'Artagnan , so mild , so kind towards Fouquet , was surprised to find himself become ferocious - almost sanguinary . 
For a long time he galloped without catching sight of the white horse . 
His rage assumed fury , he doubted himself , - he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some subterranean road , or that he had changed the white horse for one of those famous black ones , as swift as the wind , which D'Artagnan , at Saint - Mande , had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and their fleetness . 
At such moments , when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring from them , when the saddle had become burning hot , when the galled and spurred horse reared with pain , and threw behind him a shower of dust and stones , D'Artagnan , raising himself in his stirrups , and seeing nothing on the waters , nothing beneath the trees , looked up into the air like a madman . 
He was losing his senses . 
In the paroxysms of eagerness he dreamt of aerial ways , - the discovery of following century ; he called to his mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him from the prisons of Crete . 
A hoarse sigh broke from his lips , as he repeated , devoured by the fear of ridicule , `` I ! 
I ! 
duped by a Gourville ! 
I ! 
They will say that I am growing old , - they will say I have received a million to allow Fouquet to escape ! '' 
And he again dug his spurs into the sides of his horse : he had ridden astonishingly fast . 
Suddenly , at the extremity of some open pasture-ground , behind the hedges , he saw a white form which showed itself , disappeared , and at last remained distinctly visible against the rising ground . 
D'Artagnan 's heart leaped with joy . 
He wiped the streaming sweat from his brow , relaxed the tension of his knees , - by which the horse breathed more freely , - and , gathering up his reins , moderated the speed of the vigorous animal , his active accomplice on this man-hunt . 
He had then time to study the direction of the road , and his position with regard to Fouquet . 
The superintendent had completely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground . 
He felt the necessity of gaining a firmer footing , and turned towards the road by the shortest secant line . 
D'Artagnan , on his part , had nothing to do but to ride straight on , concealed by the sloping shore ; so that he would cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him . 
Then the real race would begin , - then the struggle would be in earnest . 
D'Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time . 
He observed that the superintendent had relaxed into a trot , which was to say , he , too , was favoring his horse . 
But both of them were too much pressed for time to allow them to continue long at that pace . 
The white horse sprang off like an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground . 
D'Artagnan dropped his head , and his black horse broke into a gallop . 
Both followed the same route ; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded . 
Fouquet had not yet perceived D'Artagnan . 
But on issuing from the slope , a single echo struck the air ; it was that of the steps of D'Artagnan 's horse , which rolled along like thunder . 
Fouquet turned round , and saw behind him , within a hundred paces , his enemy bent over the neck of his horse . 
There could be no doubt - the shining baldrick , the red cassock - it was a musketeer . 
Fouquet slackened his hand likewise , and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself . 
`` Oh , but , '' thought D'Artagnan , becoming very anxious , `` that is not a common horse M. Fouquet is upon - let us see ! '' 
And he attentively examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the courser . 
Round full quarters - a thin long tail - large hocks - thin legs , as dry as bars of steel - hoofs hard as marble . 
He spurred his own , but the distance between the two remained the same . 
D'Artagnan listened attentively ; not a breath of the horse reached him , and yet he seemed to cut the air . 
The black horse , on the contrary , began to puff like any blacksmith 's bellows . 
`` I must overtake him , if I kill my horse , '' thought the musketeer ; and he began to saw the mouth of the poor animal , whilst he buried the rowels of his merciless spurs into his sides . 
The maddened horse gained twenty toises , and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet . 
`` Courage ! '' 
said the musketeer to himself , `` courage ! 
the white horse will perhaps grow weaker , and if the horse does not fall , the master must pull up at last . '' 
But horse and rider remained upright together , gaining ground by difficult degrees . 
D'Artagnan uttered a wild cry , which made Fouquet turn round , and added speed to the white horse . 
`` A famous horse ! 
a mad rider ! '' 
growled the captain . 
`` Hola ! 
mordioux ! 
Monsieur Fouquet ! 
stop ! 
in the king 's name ! '' 
Fouquet made no reply . 
`` Do you hear me ? '' 
shouted D'Artagnan , whose horse had just stumbled . 
`` Pardieu ! '' 
replied Fouquet , laconically ; and rode on faster . 
D'Artagnan was nearly mad ; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his eyes . 
`` In the king 's name ! '' 
cried he again , `` stop , or I will bring you down with a pistol-shot ! '' 
`` Do ! '' 
replied Fouquet , without relaxing his speed . 
D'Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it , hoping that the double click of the spring would stop his enemy . 
`` You have pistols likewise , '' said he , `` turn and defend yourself . '' 
Fouquet did turn round at the noise , and looking D'Artagnan full in the face , opened , with his right hand , the part of his dress which concealed his body , but he did not even touch his holsters . 
There were not more than twenty paces between the two . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` I will not assassinate you ; if you will not fire upon me , surrender ! 
what is a prison ? '' 
`` I would rather die ! '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` I shall suffer less . '' 
D'Artagnan , drunk with despair , hurled his pistol to the ground . 
`` I will take you alive ! '' 
said he ; and by a prodigy of skill which this incomparable horseman alone was capable , he threw his horse forward to within ten paces of the white horse ; already his hand was stretched out to seize his prey . 
`` Kill me ! 
kill me ! '' 
cried Fouquet , '' ` twould be more humane ! '' 
`` No ! 
alive - alive ! '' 
murmured the captain . 
At this moment his horse made a false step for the second time , and Fouquet 's again took the lead . 
It was an unheard-of spectacle , this race between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their riders . 
It might be said that D'Artagnan rode , carrying his horse along between his knees . 
To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot , and that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all . 
But the chase appeared equally warm in the two fatigued athletoe . 
D'Artagnan , quite in despair , seized his second pistol , and cocked it . 
`` At your horse ! 
not at you ! '' 
cried he to Fouquet . 
And he fired . 
The animal was hit in the quarters - he made a furious bound , and plunged forward . 
At that moment D'Artagnan 's horse fell dead . 
`` I am dishonored ! '' 
thought the musketeer ; `` I am a miserable wretch ! 
for pity 's sake , M. Fouquet , throw me one of your pistols , that I may blow out my brains ! '' 
But Fouquet rode away . 
`` For mercy 's sake ! 
for mercy 's sake ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` that which you will not do at this moment , I myself will do within an hour , but here , upon this road , I should die bravely ; I should die esteemed ; do me that service , M. Fouquet ! '' 
M. Fouquet made no reply , but continued to trot on . 
D'Artagnan began to run after his enemy . 
Successively he threw away his hat , his coat , which embarrassed him , and then the sheath of his sword , which got between his legs as he was running . 
The sword in his hand itself became too heavy , and he threw it after the sheath . 
The white horse began to rattle in its throat ; D'Artagnan gained upon him . 
From a trot the exhausted animal sunk to a staggering walk - the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood . 
D'Artagnan made a desperate effort , sprang towards Fouquet , and seized him by the leg , saying in a broken , breathless voice , `` I arrest you in the king 's name ! 
blow my brains out , if you like ; we have both done our duty . '' 
Fouquet hurled far from him , into the river , the two pistols D'Artagnan might have seized , and dismounting from his horse - `` I am your prisoner , monsieur , '' said he ; `` will you take my arm , for I see you are ready to faint ? '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan , who , in fact , felt the earth sliding from under his feet , and the light of day turning to blackness around him ; then he rolled upon the sand , without breath or strength . 
Fouquet hastened to the brink of the river , dipped some water in his hat , with which he bathed the temples of the musketeer , and introduced a few drop between his lips . 
D'Artagnan raised himself with difficulty , and looked about him with a wandering eye . 
He beheld Fouquet on his knees , with his wet hat in his hand , smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness . 
`` You are not off , then ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
the true king of royalty , in heart , in soul , is not Louis of the Louvre , or Philippe of Sainte - Marguerite ; it is you , proscribed , condemned ! '' 
`` I , who this day am ruined by a single error , M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` What , in the name of Heaven , is that ? '' 
`` I should have had you for a friend ! 
But how shall we return to Nantes ? 
We are a great way from it . '' 
`` That is true , '' said D'Artagnan , gloomily . 
`` The white horse will recover , perhaps ; he is a good horse ! 
Mount , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; I will walk till you have rested a little . '' 
`` Poor beast ! 
and wounded , too ? '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` He will go , I tell you ; I know him ; but we can do better still , let us both get up , and ride slowly . '' 
`` We can try , '' said the captain . 
But they had scarcely charged the animal with this double load , when he began to stagger , and then with a great effort walked a few minutes , then staggered again , and sank down dead by the side of the black horse , which he had just managed to come up to . 
`` We will go on foot - destiny wills it so - the walk will be pleasant , '' said Fouquet , passing his arm through that of D'Artagnan . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
cried the latter , with a fixed eye , a contracted brow , and a swelling heart - `` What a disgraceful day ! '' 
They walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little wood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting . 
When Fouquet perceived that sinister machine , he said to D'Artagnan , who cast down his eyes , ashamed of Louis XIV. , `` There is an idea that did not emanate from a brave man , Captain d'Artagnan ; it is not yours . 
What are these gratings for ? '' 
said he . 
`` To prevent your throwing letters out . '' 
`` Ingenious ! '' 
`` But you can speak , if you can not write , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Can I speak to you ? '' 
`` Why , certainly , if you wish to do so . '' 
Fouquet reflected for a moment , then looking the captain full in the face , `` One single word , '' said he ; `` will you remember it ? '' 
`` I will not forget it . '' 
`` Will you speak it to whom I wish ? '' 
`` I will . '' 
`` Saint-Mande , '' articulated Fouquet , in a low voice . 
`` Well ! 
and for whom ? '' 
`` For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson . '' 
`` It shall be done . '' 
The carriage rolled through Nantes , and took the route to Angers . 
: In Which the Squirrel Falls , - the Adder Flies . 
It was two o'clock in the afternoon . 
The king , full of impatience , went to his cabinet on the terrace , and kept opening the door of the corridor , to see what his secretaries were doing . 
M. Colbert , seated in the same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning , was chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne . 
The king opened the door suddenly , and addressed them . 
`` What is it you are saying ? '' 
`` We were speaking of the first sitting of the States , '' said M. de Brienne , rising . 
`` Very well , '' replied the king , and returned to his room . 
Five minutes after , the summons of the bell recalled Rose , whose hour it was . 
`` Have you finished your copies ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` See if M. d'Artagnan has returned . '' 
`` Not yet , sire . '' 
`` It is very strange , '' murmured the king . 
`` Call M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert entered ; he had been expecting this all the morning . 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' said the king , very sharply ; `` you must ascertain what has become of M. d'Artagnan . '' 
Colbert in his calm voice replied , `` Where does your majesty desire him to be sought for ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur ! 
do you not know on what I have sent him ? '' 
replied Louis , acrimoniously . 
`` Your majesty did not inform me . '' 
`` Monsieur , there are things that must be guessed ; and you , above all , are apt to guess them . '' 
`` I might have been able to imagine , sire ; but I do not presume to be positive . '' 
Colbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the monarch and his clerk . 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , with evident joy . 
D'Artagnan , pale and in evidently bad humor , cried to the king , as he entered , `` Sire , is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
said the king . 
`` About M. Fouquet 's house ? '' 
`` None ! '' 
replied Louis . 
`` Ha ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , biting his mustache ; `` I was not mistaken , then ; it was monsieur here ; '' and he pointed to Colbert . 
`` What orders ? 
Let me know , '' said the king . 
`` Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy , to beat M. Fouquet 's servants , to force the drawers , to give over a peaceful house to pillage ! 
Mordioux ! 
these are savage orders ! '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert , turning pale . 
`` Monsieur , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` the king alone , understand , - the king alone has a right to command my musketeers ; but , as to you , I forbid you to do it , and I tell you so before his majesty ; gentlemen who carry swords do not sling pens behind their ears . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! 
D'Artagnan ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` It is humiliating , '' continued the musketeer ; `` my soldiers are disgraced . 
I do not command reitres , thank you , nor clerks of the intendant , mordioux ! '' 
`` Well ! 
but what is all this about ? '' 
said the king with authority . 
`` About this , sire ; monsieur - monsieur , who could not guess your majesty 's orders , and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M. Fouquet ; monsieur , who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for his patron of yesterday - has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of M. Fouquet , and , under the pretense of securing the surintendant 's papers , they have taken away the furniture . 
My musketeers have been posted round the house all the morning ; such were my orders . 
Why did any one presume to order them to enter ? 
Why , by forcing them to assist in this pillage , have they been made accomplices in it ? 
Mordioux ! 
we serve the king , we do ; but we do not serve M. Colbert ! '' 
-LRB- 5 -RRB- `` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the king , sternly , `` take care ; it is not in my presence that such explanations , and made in such a tone , should take place . '' 
`` I have acted for the good of the king , '' said Colbert , in a faltering voice . 
`` It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty 's officers , and that without redress , on account of the respect I owe the king . '' 
`` The respect you owe the king , '' cried D'Artagnan , his eyes flashing fire , `` consists , in the first place , in making his authority respected , and his person beloved . 
Every agent of a power without control represents that power , and when people curse the hand which strikes them , it is the royal hand that God reproaches , do you hear ? 
Must a soldier , hardened by forty years of wounds and blood , give you this lesson , monsieur ? 
Must mercy be on my side , and ferocity on yours ? 
You have caused the innocent to be arrested , bound , and imprisoned ! '' 
`` Accomplices , perhaps , of M. Fouquet , '' said Colbert . 
`` Who told you M. Fouquet had accomplices , or even that he was guilty ? 
The king alone knows that ; his justice is not blind ! 
When he says , ` Arrest and imprison ' such and such a man , he is obeyed . 
Do not talk to me , then , any more of the respect you owe the king , and be careful of your words , that they may not chance to convey the slightest menace ; for the king will not allow those to be threatened who do him service by others who do him disservice ; and if in case I should have , which God forbid ! 
a master so ungrateful , I would make myself respected . '' 
Thus saying , D'Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king 's cabinet , his eyes flashing , his hand on his sword , his lips trembling , affecting much more anger than he really felt . 
Colbert , humiliated and devoured with rage , bowed to the king as if to ask his permission to leave the room . 
The king , thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity , knew not which part to take . 
D'Artagnan saw him hesitate . 
To remain longer would have been a mistake : it was necessary to score a triumph over Colbert , and the only method was to touch the king so near the quick , that his majesty would have no other means of extrication but choosing between the two antagonists . 
D'Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done ; but the king , who , in preference to everything else , was anxious to have all the exact details of the arrest of the surintendant of the finances from him who had made him tremble for a moment , - the king , perceiving that the ill-humor of D'Artagnan would put off for half an hour at least the details he was burning to be acquainted with , - Louis , we say , forgot Colbert , who had nothing new to tell him , and recalled his captain of the musketeers . 
`` In the first place , '' said he , `` let me see the result of your commission , monsieur ; you may rest yourself hereafter . '' 
D'Artagnan , who was just passing through the doorway , stopped at the voice of the king , retraced his steps , and Colbert was forced to leave the closet . 
His countenance assumed almost a purple hue , his black and threatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick brows ; he stepped out , bowed before the king , half drew himself up in passing D'Artagnan , and went away with death in his heart . 
D'Artagnan , on being left alone with the king , softened immediately , and composing his countenance : `` Sire , '' said he , `` you are a young king . 
It is by the dawn that people judge whether the day will be fine or dull . 
How , sire , will the people , whom the hand of God has placed under your law , argue of your reign , if between them and you , you allow angry and violent ministers to interpose their mischief ? 
But let us speak of myself , sire , let us leave a discussion that may appear idle , and perhaps inconvenient to you . 
Let us speak of myself . 
I have arrested M. Fouquet . '' 
`` You took plenty of time about it , '' said the king , sharply . 
D'Artagnan looked at the king . 
`` I perceive that I have expressed myself badly . 
I announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` You did ; and what then ? '' 
`` Well ! 
I ought to have told your majesty that M. Fouquet had arrested me ; that would have been more just . 
I re-establish the truth , then ; I have been arrested by M. Fouquet . '' 
It was now the turn of Louis XIV . 
to be surprised . 
His majesty was astonished in his turn . 
D'Artagnan , with his quick glance , appreciated what was passing in the heart of his master . 
He did not allow him time to put any questions . 
He related , with that poetry , that picturesqueness , which perhaps he alone possessed at that period , the escape of Fouquet , the pursuit , the furious race , and , lastly , the inimitable generosity of the surintendant , who might have fled ten times over , who might have killed the adversary in the pursuit , but who had preferred imprisonment , perhaps worse , to the humiliation of one who wished to rob him of his liberty . 
In proportion as the tale advanced , the king became agitated , devouring the narrator 's words , and drumming with his finger-nails upon the table . 
`` It results from all this , sire , in my eyes , at least , that the man who conducts himself thus is a gallant man , and can not be an enemy to the king . 
That is my opinion , and I repeat it to your majesty . 
I know what the king will say to me , and I bow to it , - reasons of state . 
So be it ! 
To my ears that sounds highly respectable . 
But I am a soldier , and I have received my orders , my orders are executed - very unwillingly on my part , it is true , but they are executed . 
I say no more . '' 
`` Where is M. Fouquet at this moment ? '' 
asked Louis , after a short silence . 
`` M. Fouquet , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` is in the iron cage that M. Colbert had prepared for him , and is galloping as fast as four strong horses can drag him , towards Angers . '' 
`` Why did you leave him on the road ? '' 
`` Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers . 
The proof , the best proof of what I advance , is that the king desired me to be sought for but this minute . 
And then I had another reason . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Whilst I was with him , poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the king , astonished . 
`` Your majesty ought to understand , and does understand , certainly , that my warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty . 
I have given him one of my brigadiers , the most stupid I could find among my musketeers , in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping . '' 
`` Are you mad , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
cried the king , crossing his arms on his breast . 
`` Do people utter such enormities , even when they have the misfortune to think them ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
sire , you can not expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet , after what he has just done for you and me . 
No , no ; if you desire that he should remain under your lock and bolt , never give him in charge to me ; however closely wired might be the cage , the bird would , in the end , take wing . '' 
`` I am surprised , '' said the king , in his sternest tone , `` you did not follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne . 
You had in him all you want - affection , gratitude . 
In my service , monsieur , you will only find a master . '' 
`` If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan , with a deeply impressive manner , `` one single man would have gone there , and I should have been that man - you know that right well , sire . '' 
The king was brought to a pause . 
Before that speech of his captain of the musketeers , so frankly spoken and so true , the king had nothing to offer . 
On hearing D'Artagnan , Louis remembered the D'Artagnan of former times ; him who , at the Palais Royal , held himself concealed behind the curtains of his bed , when the people of Paris , led by Cardinal de Retz , came to assure themselves of the presence of the king ; the D'Artagnan whom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage , when repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris ; the soldier who had quitted his service at Blois ; the lieutenant he had recalled to be beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power ; the man he had always found loyal , courageous , devoted . 
Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert . 
Colbert had not left the corridor where the secretaries were at work . 
He reappeared . 
`` Colbert , did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` What has it produced ? '' 
`` M. de Roncherolles , who was sent with your majesty 's musketeers , has remitted me some papers , '' replied Colbert . 
`` I will look at them . 
Give me your hand . '' 
`` My hand , sire ! '' 
`` Yes , that I may place it in that of M. d'Artagnan . 
In fact , M. d'Artagnan , '' added he , with a smile , turning towards the soldier , who , at sight of the clerk , had resumed his haughty attitude , `` you do not know this man ; make his acquaintance . '' 
And he pointed to Colbert . 
`` He has been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions , but he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
stammered Colbert , confused with pleasure and fear . 
`` I always understood why , '' murmured D'Artagnan in the king 's ear ; `` he was jealous . '' 
`` Precisely , and his jealousy confined his wings . '' 
`` He will henceforward be a winged-serpent , '' grumbled the musketeer , with a remnant of hatred against his recent adversary . 
But Colbert , approaching him , offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear ; he appeared so good , so mild , so easy ; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble , that D'Artagnan , a connoisseur in physiognomies , was moved , and almost changed in his convictions . 
Colbert pressed his hand . 
`` That which the king has just told you , monsieur , proves how well his majesty is acquainted with men . 
The inveterate opposition I have displayed , up to this day , against abuses and not against men , proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign , for my country a great blessing . 
I have many ideas , M. d'Artagnan . 
You will see them expand in the sun of public peace ; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men , I am at least certain , monsieur , that I shall obtain their esteem . 
For their admiration , monsieur , I would give my life . '' 
This change , this sudden elevation , this mute approbation of the king , gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection . 
He bowed civilly to Colbert , who did not take his eyes off him . 
The king , when he saw they were reconciled , dismissed them . 
They left the room together . 
As soon as they were out of the cabinet , the new minister , stopping the captain , said : `` Is it possible , M. d'Artagnan , that with such an eye as yours , you did not , at the first glance , at the first impression , discover what sort of man I am ? '' 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' replied the musketeer , `` a ray of the sun in our eyes prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame . 
The man in power radiates , you know ; and since you are there , why should you continue to persecute him who had just fallen into disgrace , and fallen from such a height ? '' 
`` I , monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert ; `` oh , monsieur ! 
I would never persecute him . 
I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone , because I am ambitious , and , above all , because I have the most entire confidence in my own merit ; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes , and I love to look at the king 's gold ; because , if I live thirty years , in thirty years not a denir of it will remain in my hands ; because , with that gold , I will build granaries , castles , cities , and harbors ; because I will create a marine , I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people ; because I will create libraries and academies ; because I will make France the first country in the world , and the wealthiest . 
These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet , who prevented my acting . 
And then , when I shall be great and strong , when France is great and strong , in my turn , then , will I cry , ` Mercy ' ! '' 
`` Mercy , did you say ? 
then ask his liberty of the king . 
The king is only crushing him on your account . '' 
Colbert again raised his head . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you know that is not so , and that the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet ; it is not for me to teach you that . '' 
`` But the king will grow tired ; he will forget . '' 
`` The king never forgets , M. d'Artagnan . 
Hark ! 
the king calls . 
He is going to issue an order . 
I have not influenced him , have I ? 
Listen . '' 
The king , in fact , was calling his secretaries . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he . 
`` I am here , sire . '' 
`` Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan , to form a guard for M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks . 
`` And from Angers , '' continued the king , `` they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile , in Paris . '' 
`` You were right , '' said the captain to the minister . 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' continued the king , `` you will have any one shot who shall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet , during the journey . '' 
`` But myself , sire , '' said the duke . 
`` You , monsieur , you will only speak to him in the presence of the musketeers . '' 
The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission . 
D'Artagnan was about to retire likewise ; but the king stopped him . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you will go immediately , and take possession of the isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . 
Alone ? '' 
`` You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay , in case the place should be contumacious . '' 
A murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers . 
`` That shall be done , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I saw the place in my infancy , '' resumed the king , `` and I do not wish to see it again . 
You have heard me ? 
Go , monsieur , and do not return without the keys . '' 
Colbert went up to D'Artagnan . 
`` A commission which , if you carry it out well , '' said he , `` will be worth a marechal 's baton to you . '' 
`` Why do you employ the words , ` if you carry it out well ' ? '' 
`` Because it is difficult . '' 
`` Ah ! 
in what respect ? '' 
`` You have friends in Belle-Isle , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; and it is not an easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to obtain success . '' 
D'Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought , whilst Colbert returned to the king . 
A quarter of an hour after , the captain received the written order from the king , to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle , in case of resistance , with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or refugees , and an injunction not to allow one to escape . 
`` Colbert was right , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` for me the baton of a marechal of France will cost the lives of my two friends . 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds , and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings . 
I will show them that hand so plainly , that they will have quite time enough to see it . 
Poor Porthos ! 
Poor Aramis ! 
No ; my fortune should shall not cost your wings a feather . '' 
Having thus determined , D'Artagnan assembled the royal army , embarked it at Paimboeuf , and set sail , without the loss of an unnecessary minute . 
: Belle-Ile-en-Mer . 
At the extremity of the mole , against which the furious sea beats at the evening tide , two men , holding each other by the arm , were conversing in an animated and expansive tone , without the possibility of any other human being hearing their words , borne away , as they were , one by one , by the gusts of wind , with the white foam swept from the crests of the waves . 
The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned ocean , like a gigantic crucible . 
From time to time , one of these men , turning towards the east , cast an anxious , inquiring look over the sea . 
The other , interrogating the features of his companion , seemed to seek for information in his looks . 
Then , both silent , busied with dismal thoughts , they resumed their walk . 
Every one has already perceived that these two men were our proscribed heroes , Porthos and Aramis , who had taken refuge in Belle-Isle , since the ruin of their hopes , since the discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d'Herblay . 
`` If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary , my dear Aramis , '' repeated Porthos , inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he charged his massive chest , `` It is of no use , Aramis . 
The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary circumstance . 
There has been no storm at sea ; the weather has been constantly calm , not even the lightest gale ; and even if we had had a tempest , all our boats would not have foundered . 
I repeat , it is strange . 
This complete disappearance astonishes me , I tell you . '' 
`` True , '' murmured Aramis . 
`` You are right , friend Porthos ; it is true , there is something strange in it . '' 
`` And further , '' added Porthos , whose ideas the assent of the bishop of Vannes seemed to enlarge ; `` and , further , do you not observe that if the boats have perished , not a single plank has washed ashore ? '' 
`` I have remarked it as well as yourself . '' 
`` And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in the whole island , and which I sent in search of the others - '' Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry , and by so sudden a movement , that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied . 
`` What do you say , Porthos ? 
What ! 
- You have sent the two boats - '' `` In search of the others ! 
Yes , to be sure I have , '' replied Porthos , calmly . 
`` Unhappy man ! 
What have you done ? 
Then we are indeed lost , '' cried the bishop . 
`` Lost ! 
- what did you say ? '' 
exclaimed the terrified Porthos . 
`` How lost , Aramis ? 
How are we lost ? '' 
Aramis bit his lips . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
Your pardon , I meant to say - '' `` What ? '' 
`` That if we were inclined - if we took a fancy to make an excursion by sea , we could not . '' 
`` Very good ! 
and why should that vex you ? 
A precious pleasure , ma foi ! 
For my part , I do n't regret it at all . 
What I regret is certainly not the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle : what I regret , Aramis , is Pierrefonds ; Bracieux ; le Vallon ; beautiful France ! 
Here , we are not in France , my dear friend ; we are - I know not where . 
Oh ! 
I tell you , in full sincerity of soul , and your affection will excuse my frankness , but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle . 
No ; in good truth , I am not happy ! '' 
Aramis breathed a long , but stifled sigh . 
`` Dear friend , '' replied he : `` that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago . 
If you had not sent them away , we would have departed . '' '' 
` Departed ! ' 
And the orders , Aramis ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
Why , the orders you have been constantly , in and out of season , repeating to me - that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper . 
You know very well ! '' 
`` That is true ! '' 
murmured Aramis again . 
`` You see , then , plainly , my friend , that we could not depart ; and that the sending away of the boats in search of the others can not prove prejudicial to us in the very least . '' 
Aramis was silent ; and his vague glances , luminous as that of an albatross , hovered for a long time over the sea , interrogating space , seeking to pierce the very horizon . 
`` With all that , Aramis , '' continued Porthos , who adhered to his idea , and that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it , - `` with all that , you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these unfortunate boats . 
I am assailed by cries and complaints whichever way I go . 
The children cry to see the desolation of the women , as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers . 
What do you suppose , my friend , and how ought I to answer them ? '' 
`` Think all you like , my good Porthos , and say nothing . '' 
This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all . 
He turned away grumbling something in ill-humor . 
Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer . 
`` Do you remember , '' said he , in a melancholy tone , kneading the two hands of the giant between his own with affectionate cordiality , `` do you remember , my friend , that in the glorious days of youth - do you remember , Porthos , when we were all strong and valiant - we , and the other two - if we had then had an inclination to return to France , do you think this sheet of salt water would have stopped us ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` but six leagues . '' 
`` If you had seen me get astride of a plank , would you have remained on land , Porthos ? '' 
`` No , pardieu ! 
No , Aramis . 
But , nowadays , what sort of a plank should we want , my friend ! 
I , in particular . '' 
And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh . 
`` And do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little , and that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling - of your episcopal palace , at Vannes ? 
Come , confess . '' 
`` No , '' replied Aramis , without daring to look at Porthos . 
`` Let us stay where we are , then , '' said his friend , with a sigh , which , in spite of the efforts he made to restrain it , escaped his echoing breast . 
`` Let us remain ! 
- let us remain ! 
And yet , '' added he , `` and yet , if we seriously wished , but that decidedly - if we had a fixed idea , one firmly taken , to return to France , and there were not boats - '' `` Have you remarked another thing , my friend - that is , since the disappearance of our barks , during the last two days ' absence of fishermen , not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the isle ? '' 
`` Yes , certainly ! 
you are right . 
I , too , have remarked it , and the observation was the more naturally made , for , before the last two fatal days , barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps . '' 
`` I must inquire , '' said Aramis , suddenly , and with great agitation . 
`` And then , if we had a raft constructed - '' `` But there are some canoes , my friend ; shall I board one ? '' 
`` A canoe ! 
- a canoe ! 
Can you think of such a thing , Porthos ? 
A canoe to be upset in . 
No , no , '' said the bishop of Vannes ; `` it is not our trade to ride upon the waves . 
We will wait , we will wait . '' 
And Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation . 
Porthos , who grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his friend - Porthos , who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of the sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his companion 's continual convulsive starts - Porthos stopped him . 
`` Let us sit down upon this rock , '' said he . 
`` Place yourself there , close to me , Aramis , and I conjure you , for the last time , to explain to me in a manner I can comprehend - explain to me what we are doing here . '' 
`` Porthos , '' said Aramis , much embarrassed . 
`` I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king . 
That is a fact , that I understand . 
Well - '' `` Yes ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to the English . 
I understand that , too . '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into Belle-Isle to take direction of the works , and the command of ten companies levied and paid by M. Fouquet , or rather the ten companies of his son-in-law . 
All that is plain . '' 
Aramis rose in a state of great impatience . 
He might be said to be a lion importuned by a gnat . 
Porthos held him by the arm . 
`` But what I can not understand , what , in spite of all the efforts of my mind , and all my reflections , I can not comprehend , and never shall comprehend , is , that instead of sending us troops , instead of sending us reinforcements of men , munitions , provisions , they leave us without boats , they leave Belle - Isle without arrivals , without help ; it is that instead of establishing with us a correspondence , whether by signals , or written or verbal communications , all relations with the shore are intercepted . 
Tell me , Aramis , answer me , or rather , before answering me , will you allow me to tell you what I have thought ? 
Will you hear what my idea is , the plan I have conceived ? '' 
The bishop raised his head . 
`` Well ! 
Aramis , '' continued Porthos , `` I have dreamed , I have imagined that an event has taken place in France . 
I dreamt of M. Fouquet all the night , of lifeless fish , of broken eggs , of chambers badly furnished , meanly kept . 
Villainous dreams , my dear D'Herblay ; very unlucky , such dreams ! '' 
`` Porthos , what is that yonder ? '' 
interrupted Aramis , rising suddenly , and pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the water . 
`` A bark ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` yes , it is a bark ! 
Ah ! 
we shall have some news at last . '' 
`` There are two ! '' 
cried the bishop , on discovering another mast ; `` two ! 
three ! 
four ! '' 
`` Five ! '' 
said Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Six ! 
seven ! 
Ah ! 
mon Dieu ! 
mon Dieu ! 
it is a fleet ! '' 
`` Our boats returning , probably , '' said Aramis , very uneasily , in spite of the assurance he affected . 
`` They are very large for fishing-boats , '' observed Porthos , `` and do you not remark , my friend , that they come from the Loire ? '' 
`` They come from the Loire - yes - '' `` And look ! 
everybody here sees them as well as ourselves ; look , women and children are beginning to crowd the jetty . '' 
An old fisherman passed . 
`` Are those our barks , yonder ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
The old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon . 
`` No , monseigneur , '' replied he , `` they are lighter boars , boats in the king 's service . '' 
`` Boats in the royal service ? '' 
replied Aramis , starting . 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
said he . 
`` By the flag . '' 
`` But , '' said Porthos , `` the boat is scarcely visible ; how the devil , my friend , can you distinguish the flag ? '' 
`` I see there is one , '' replied the old man ; `` our boats , trade lighters , do not carry any . 
That sort of craft is generally used for transport of troops . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
groaned Aramis . 
`` Vivat ! '' 
cried Porthos , `` they are sending us reinforcements , do n't you think they are , Aramis ? '' 
`` Probably . '' 
`` Unless it is the English coming . '' 
`` By the Loire ? 
That would have an evil look , Porthos ; for they must have come through Paris ! '' 
`` You are right ; they are reinforcements , decidedly , or provisions . '' 
Aramis leaned his head upon his hands , and made no reply . 
Then , all at once , - `` Porthos , '' said he , `` have the alarm sounded . '' 
`` The alarm ! 
do you imagine such a thing ? '' 
`` Yes , and let the cannoniers mount their batteries , the artillerymen be at their pieces , and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries . '' 
Porthos opened his eyes to their widest extent . 
He looked attentively at his friend , to convince himself he was in his proper senses . 
`` I will do it , my dear Porthos , '' continued Aramis , in his blandest tone ; `` I will go and have these orders executed myself , if you do not go , my friend . '' 
`` Well ! 
I will - instantly ! '' 
said Porthos , who went to execute the orders , casting all the while looks behind him , to see if the bishop of Vannes were not deceived ; and if , on recovering more rational ideas , he would not recall him . 
The alarm was sounded , trumpets brayed , drums rolled ; the great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry . 
The dikes and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers ; matches sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen , placed behind the large cannon bedded in their stone carriages . 
When every man was at his post , when all the preparations for defense were made : `` Permit me , Aramis , to try to comprehend , '' whispered Porthos , timidly , in Aramis 's ear . 
`` My dear friend , you will comprehend but too soon , '' murmured M. d'Herblay , in reply to this question of his lieutenant . 
`` The fleet which is coming yonder , with sails unfurled , straight towards the port of Belle-Isle , is a royal fleet , is it not ? '' 
`` But as there are two kings in France , Porthos , to which of these two kings does this fleet belong ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you open my eyes , '' replied the giant , stunned by the insinuation . 
And Porthos , whose eyes this reply of his friend 's had at last opened , or rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight , went with his best speed to the batteries to overlook his people , and exhort every one to do his duty . 
In the meantime , Aramis , with his eye fixed on the horizon , saw the ships continually drawing nearer . 
The people and the soldiers , perched on the summits of the rocks , could distinguish the masts , then the lower sails , and at last the hulls of the lighters , bearing at the masthead the royal flag of France . 
It was night when one of these vessels , which had created such a sensation among the inhabitants of Belle-Isle , dropped anchor within cannon shot of the place . 
It was soon seen , notwithstanding the darkness , that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel , from the side of which a skiff was lowered , of which the three rowers , bending to their oars , took the direction of the port , and in a few instants struck land at the foot of the fort . 
The commander jumped ashore . 
He had a letter in his hand , which he waved in the air , and seemed to wish to communicate with somebody . 
This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of the pilots of the island . 
He was the captain of one of the two barks retained by Aramis , but which Porthos , in his anxiety with regard to the fate of the fishermen who had disappeared , had sent in search of the missing boats . 
He asked to be conducted to M. d'Herblay . 
Two soldiers , at a signal from a sergeant , marched him between them , and escorted him . 
Aramis was upon the quay . 
The envoy presented himself before the bishop of Vannes . 
The darkness was almost absolute , notwithstanding the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following Aramis in his rounds . 
`` Well , Jonathan , from whom do you come ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , from those who captured me . '' 
`` Who captured you ? '' 
`` You know , monseigneur , we set out in search of our comrades ? '' 
`` Yes ; and afterwards ? '' 
`` Well ! 
monseigneur , within a short league we were captured by a chasse maree belonging to the king . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Of which king ? '' 
cried Porthos . 
Jonathan started . 
`` Speak ! '' 
continued the bishop . 
`` We were captured , monseigneur , and joined to those who had been taken yesterday morning . '' 
`` What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , to prevent us from telling you , '' replied Jonathan . 
Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend . 
`` And they have released you to-day ? '' 
asked he . 
`` That I might tell you they have captured us , monsieur . '' 
`` Trouble upon trouble , '' thought honest Porthos . 
During this time Aramis was reflecting . 
`` Humph ! '' 
said he , `` then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the coasts ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Who commands it ? '' 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos . 
`` I believe that is the name . '' 
`` And did he give you this letter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Bring the torches nearer . '' 
`` It is his writing , '' said Porthos . 
Aramis eagerly read the following lines : `` Order of the king to take Belle-Isle ; or to put the garrison to the sword , if they resist ; order to make prisoners of all the men of the garrison ; signed , D'ARTAGNAN , who , the day before yesterday , arrested M. Fouquet , for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile . '' 
Aramis turned pale , and crushed the paper in his hands . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Nothing , my friend , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Jonathan ? '' 
`` Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Did you speak to M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` That for ampler information , he would speak with monseigneur . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` On board his own vessel . '' 
`` On board his vessel ! '' 
and Porthos repeated , `` On board his vessel ! '' 
`` M. le mousquetaire , '' continued Jonathan , `` told me to take you both on board my canoe , and bring you to him . '' 
`` Let us go at once , '' exclaimed Porthos . 
`` Dear D'Artagnan ! '' 
But Aramis stopped him . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Who knows that it is not a snare ? '' 
`` Of the other king 's ? '' 
said Porthos , mysteriously . 
`` A snare , in fact ! 
That 's what it is , my friend . '' 
`` Very possibly ; what is to be done , then ? 
If D'Artagnan sends for us - '' `` Who assures you that D'Artagnan sends for us ? '' 
`` Well , but - but his writing - '' `` Writing is easily counterfeited . 
This looks counterfeited - unsteady - '' `` You are always right ; but , in the meantime , we know nothing . '' 
Aramis was silent . 
`` It is true , '' said the good Porthos , `` we do not want to know anything . '' 
`` What shall I do ? '' 
asked Jonathan . 
`` You will return on board this captain 's vessel . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I comprehend ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Yes , monseigneur , '' replied Jonathan ; `` but if the captain should refuse to come to Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` If he refuses , as we have cannon , we will make use of them . '' 
`` What ! 
against D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` If it is D'Artagnan , Porthos , he will come . 
Go , Jonathan , go ! '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I no longer comprehend anything , '' murmured Porthos . 
`` I will make you comprehend it all , my dear friend ; the time for it has come ; sit down upon this gun-carriage , open your ears , and listen well to me . '' 
`` Oh ! 
pardieu ! 
I will listen , no fear of that . '' 
`` May I depart , monseigneur ? '' 
cried Jonathan . 
`` Yes , begone , and bring back an answer . 
Allow the canoe to pass , you men there ! '' 
And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet . 
Aramis took Porthos by the hand , and commenced his explanations . 
: Explanations by Aramis . 
`` What I have to say to you , friend Porthos , will probably surprise you , but it may prove instructive . '' 
`` I like to be surprised , '' said Porthos , in a kindly tone ; `` do not spare me , therefore , I beg . 
I am hardened against emotions ; do n't fear , speak out . '' 
`` It is difficult , Porthos - difficult ; for , in truth , I warn you a second time , I have very strange things , very extraordinary things , to tell you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you speak so well , my friend , that I could listen to you for days together . 
Speak , then , I beg - and - stop , I have an idea : I will , to make your task more easy , I will , to assist you in telling me such things , question you . '' 
`` I shall be pleased at your doing so . '' 
`` What are we going to fight for , Aramis ? '' 
`` If you ask me many such questions as that - if you would render my task the easier by interrupting my revelations thus , Porthos , you will not help me at all . 
So far , on the contrary , that is the very Gordian knot . 
But , my friend , with a man like you , good , generous , and devoted , the confession must be bravely made . 
I have deceived you , my worthy friend . '' 
`` You have deceived me ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
yes . '' 
`` Was it for my good , Aramis ? '' 
`` I thought so , Porthos ; I thought so sincerely , my friend . '' 
`` Then , '' said the honest seigneur of Bracieux , `` you have rendered me a service , and I thank you for it ; for if you had not deceived me , I might have deceived myself . 
In what , then , have you deceived me , tell me ? '' 
`` In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV. , at this moment , is directing his efforts . '' 
`` The usurper ! '' 
said Porthos , scratching his head . 
`` That is - well , I do not quite clearly comprehend ! '' 
`` He is one of the two kings who are contending fro the crown of France . '' 
`` Very well ! 
Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` You have hit the matter in one word . '' 
`` It follows that - '' `` It follows that we are rebels , my poor friend . '' 
`` The devil ! 
the devil ! '' 
cried Porthos , much disappointed . 
`` Oh ! 
but , dear Porthos , be calm , we shall still find means of getting out of the affair , trust me . '' 
`` It is not that which makes me uneasy , '' replied Porthos ; `` that which alone touches me is that ugly word rebels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
but - '' `` And so , according to this , the duchy that was promised me - '' `` It was the usurper that was to give it to you . '' 
`` And that is not the same thing , Aramis , '' said Porthos , majestically . 
`` My friend , if it had only depended upon me , you should have become a prince . '' 
Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way . 
`` That is where you have been wrong , '' continued he , `` in deceiving me ; for that promised duchy I reckoned upon . 
Oh ! 
I reckoned upon it seriously , knowing you to be a man of your word , Aramis . '' 
`` Poor Porthos ! 
pardon me , I implore you ! '' 
`` So , then , '' continued Porthos , without replying to the bishop 's prayer , `` so then , it seems , I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I will settle all that , my good friend , I will settle all that . 
I will take it on myself alone ! '' 
`` Aramis ! '' 
`` No , no , Porthos , I conjure you , let me act . 
No false generosity ! 
No inopportune devotedness ! 
You knew nothing of my projects . 
You have done nothing of yourself . 
With me it is different . 
I alone am the author of this plot . 
I stood in need of my inseparable companion ; I called upon you , and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device , ` All for one , one for all . ' 
My crime is that I was an egotist . '' 
`` Now , that is a word I like , '' said Porthos ; `` and seeing that you have acted entirely for yourself , it is impossible for me to blame you . 
It is natural . '' 
And upon this sublime reflection , Porthos pressed his friend 's hand cordially . 
In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul , Aramis felt his own littleness . 
It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before real superiority of heart , which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind . 
He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend . 
`` Now , '' said Porthos , `` that we have come to an explanation , now that I am perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV. , I think , my friend , it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of all this . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth . 
The king Louis XIV . 
has no longer now but one enemy : that enemy is myself , myself alone . 
I have made you a prisoner , you have followed me , to-day I liberate you , you fly back to your prince . 
You can perceive , Porthos , there is not one difficulty in all this . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` I am quite sure of it . '' 
`` Then why , '' said the admirable good sense of Porthos , `` then why , if we are in such an easy position , why , my friend , do we prepare cannon , muskets , and engines of all sorts ? 
It seems to me it would be much more simple to say to Captain d'Artagnan : ` My dear friend , we have been mistaken ; that error is to be repaired ; open the door to us , let us pass through , and we will say good-bye . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
that ! '' 
said Aramis , shaking his head . 
`` Why do you say ` that ' ? 
Do you not approve of my plan , my friend ? '' 
`` I see a difficulty in it . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` The hypothesis that D'Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us to defend ourselves . '' 
`` What ! 
defend ourselves against D'Artagnan ? 
Folly ! 
Against the good D'Artagnan ! '' 
Aramis once more replied by shaking his head . 
`` Porthos , '' at length said he , `` if I have had the matches lighted and the guns pointed , if I have had the signal of alarm sounded , if I have called every man to his post upon the ramparts , those good ramparts of Belle - Isle which you have so well fortified , it was not for nothing . 
Wait to judge ; or rather , no , do not wait - '' `` What can I do ? '' 
`` If I knew , my friend , I would have told you . '' 
`` But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves : - a boat , and away for France - where - '' `` My dear friend , '' said Aramis , smiling with a strong shade of sadness , `` do not let us reason like children ; let us be men in council and in execution . 
- But , hark ! 
I hear a hail for landing at the port . 
Attention , Porthos , serious attention ! '' 
`` It is D'Artagnan , no doubt , '' said Porthos , in a voice of thunder , approaching the parapet . 
`` Yes , it is I , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , running lightly up the steps of the mole , and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which his two friends waited for him . 
As soon as he came towards them , Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D'Artagnan , treading apparently in his very steps . 
The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole , when half-way up . 
His companions imitated him . 
`` Make your men draw back , '' cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis ; `` let them retire out of hearing . '' 
This order , given by Porthos , was executed immediately . 
Then D'Artagnan , turning towards him who followed him : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we are no longer on board the king 's fleet , where , in virtue of your order , you spoke so arrogantly to me , just now . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the officer , `` I did not speak arrogantly to you ; I simply , but rigorously , obeyed instructions . 
I was commanded to follow you . 
I follow you . 
I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do ; I am in duty bound , accordingly , to overhear your conversations . '' 
D'Artagnan trembled with rage , and Porthos and Aramis , who heard this dialogue , trembled likewise , but with uneasiness and fear . 
D'Artagnan , biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him exasperation , closely to be followed by an explosion , approached the officer . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , so much the more impressive , that , affecting calm , it threatened tempest - `` monsieur , when I sent a canoe hither , you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle . 
You produced an order to that effect ; and , in my turn , I instantly showed you the note I had written . 
When the skipper of the boat sent by me returned , when I received the reply of these two gentlemen '' -LRB- and he pointed to Aramis and Porthos -RRB- , `` you heard every word of what the messenger said . 
All that was plainly in your orders , all that was well executed , very punctually , was it not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' stammered the officer ; `` yes , without doubt , but - '' `` Monsieur , '' continued D'Artagnan , growing warm - `` monsieur , when I manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle , you demanded to accompany me ; I did not hesitate ; I brought you with me . 
You are now at Belle-Isle , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; but - '' `` But - the question no longer is of M. Colbert , who has given you that order , or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions ; the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d'Artagnan , and who is alone with M. d'Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet of salt water ; a bad position for that man , a bad position , monsieur ! 
I warn you . '' 
`` But , monsieur , if I am a restraint upon you , '' said the officer , timidly , and almost faintly , `` it is my duty which - '' `` Monsieur , you have had the misfortune , either you or those that sent you , to insult me . 
It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water . 
Oh ! 
it will happen ! 
it will happen ! 
I have only been six times angry in my life , monsieur , and all five preceding times I killed my man . '' 
The officer did not stir ; he became pale under this terrible threat , but replied with simplicity , `` Monsieur , you are wrong in acting against my orders . '' 
Porthos and Aramis , mute and trembling at the top of the parapet , cried to the musketeer , `` Good D'Artagnan , take care ! '' 
D'Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence , raised his foot with ominous calmness to mount the stair , and turned round , sword in hand , to see if the officer followed him . 
The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped up . 
Porthos and Aramis , who knew their D'Artagnan , uttered a cry , and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard . 
But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand , - `` Monsieur , '' said he to the officer , in an agitated voice , `` you are a brave man . 
You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you now . '' 
`` Speak , Monsieur d'Artagnan , speak , '' replied the officer . 
`` These gentlemen we have just seen , and against whom you have orders , are my friends . '' 
`` I know they are , monsieur . '' 
`` You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions prescribe . '' 
`` I understand your reserve . '' 
`` Very well ; permit me , then , to converse with them without a witness . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , if I yield to your request , if I do that which you beg me , I break my word ; but if I do not do it , I disoblige you . 
I prefer the one dilemma to the other . 
Converse with your friends , and do not despise me , monsieur , for doing this for your sake , whom I esteem and honor ; do not despise me for committing for you , and you alone , an unworthy act . '' 
D'Artagnan , much agitated , threw his arm round the neck of the young man , and then went up to his friends . 
The officer , enveloped in his cloak , sat down on the damp , weed-covered steps . 
`` Well ! '' 
said D'Artagnan to his friends , `` such is my position , judge for yourselves . '' 
All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth . 
`` What is the meaning of all these preparations ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not any , I assure you , my dear captain ; for , in fact , I have done nothing , no more has Aramis , '' the worthy baron hastened to say . 
D'Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate , which penetrated that hardened heart . 
`` Dear Porthos ! '' 
cried the bishop of Vannes . 
`` You see what is being done against you , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` interception of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle . 
Your means of transport seized . 
If you had endeavored to fly , you would have fallen into the hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions , on the watch for you . 
The king wants you to be taken , and he will take you . '' 
D'Artagnan tore at his gray mustache . 
Aramis grew somber , Porthos angry . 
`` My idea was this , '' continued D'Artagnan : `` to make you both come on board , to keep you near me , and restore you your liberty . 
But now , who can say , when I return to my ship , I may not find a superior ; that I may not find secret orders which will take from me my command , and give it to another , who will dispose of me and you without hope of help ? '' 
`` We must remain at Belle-Isle , '' said Aramis , resolutely ; `` and I assure you , for my part , I will not surrender easily . '' 
Porthos said nothing . 
D'Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend . 
`` I have another trial to make of this officer , of this brave fellow who accompanies me , and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy ; for it denotes an honest man , who , though an enemy , is a thousand times better than a complaisant coward . 
Let us try to learn from him what his instructions are , and what his orders permit or forbid . '' 
`` Let us try , '' said Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went to the parapet , leaned over towards the steps of the mole , and called the officer , who immediately came up . 
`` Monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other , `` monsieur , if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here , what would you do ? '' 
`` I should not oppose it , monsieur ; but having direct explicit orders to put them under guard , I should detain them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` That 's all over , '' said Aramis , gloomily . 
Porthos did not stir . 
`` But still take Porthos , '' said the bishop of Vannes . 
`` He can prove to the king , and I will help him do so , and you too , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that he had nothing to do with this affair . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Will you come ? 
Will you follow me , Porthos ? 
The king is merciful . '' 
`` I want time for reflection , '' said Porthos . 
`` You will remain here , then ? '' 
`` Until fresh orders , '' said Aramis , with vivacity . 
`` Until we have an idea , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` and I now believe that will not be long , for I have one already . '' 
`` Let us say adieu , then , '' said Aramis ; `` but in truth , my good Porthos , you ought to go . '' 
`` No , '' said the latter , laconically . 
`` As you please , '' replied Aramis , a little wounded in his susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion . 
`` Only I am reassured by the promise of an idea from D'Artagnan , an idea I fancy I have divined . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the musketeer , placing his ear near Aramis 's mouth . 
The latter spoke several words rapidly , to which D'Artagnan replied , `` That is it , precisely . '' 
`` Infallible ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` During the first emotion this resolution will cause , take care of yourself , Aramis . '' 
`` Oh ! 
do n't be afraid . '' 
`` Now , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan to the officer , `` thanks , a thousand thanks ! 
You have made yourself three friends for life . '' 
`` Yes , '' added Aramis . 
Porthos alone said nothing , but merely bowed . 
D'Artagnan , having tenderly embraced his two old friends , left Belle-Isle with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had saddled him . 
Thus , with the exception of the explanation with which the worthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied , nothing had changed in appearance in the fate of one or the other , `` Only , '' said Aramis , `` there is D'Artagnan 's idea . '' 
D'Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea he had discovered . 
Now , we know that whatever D'Artagnan did examine , according to custom , daylight was certain to illuminate . 
As to the officer , now grown mute again , he had full time for meditation . 
Therefore , on putting his foot on board his vessel , moored within cannon - shot of the island , the captain of the musketeers had already got together all his means , offensive and defensive . 
He immediately assembled his council , which consisted of the officers serving under his orders . 
These were eight in number ; a chief of the maritime forces ; a major directing the artillery ; an engineer , the officer we are acquainted with , and four lieutenants . 
Having assembled them , D'Artagnan arose , took of his hat , and addressed them thus : `` Gentlemen , I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer , and I have found in it a good and solid garrison ; moreover , preparations are made for a defense that may prove troublesome . 
I therefore intend to send for two of the principal officers of the place , that we may converse with them . 
Having separated them from their troops and cannon , we shall be better able to deal with them ; particularly by reasoning with them . 
Is not this your opinion , gentlemen ? '' 
The major of artillery rose . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , with respect , but firmness , `` I have heard you say that the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense . 
The place is then , as you know , determined on rebellion ? '' 
D'Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply ; but he was not the man to allow himself to be subdued by a trifle , and resumed : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` your reply is just . 
But you are ignorant that Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet 's , and that former monarchs gave the right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people . '' 
The major made a movement . 
`` Oh ! 
do not interrupt me , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
`` You are going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the English was not a right to arm themselves against their king . 
But it is not M. Fouquet , I suppose , who holds Belle-Isle at this moment , since I arrested M. Fouquet the day before yesterday . 
Now the inhabitants and defenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest . 
You would announce it to them in vain . 
It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary , so unexpected , that they would not believe you . 
A Breton serves his master , and not his masters ; he serves his master till he has seen him dead . 
Now the Bretons , as far as I know , have not seen the body of M. Fouquet . 
It is not , then , surprising they hold out against that which is neither M. Fouquet nor his signature . '' 
The major bowed in token of assent . 
`` That is why , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I propose to cause two of the principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel . 
They will see you , gentlemen ; they will see the forces we have at our disposal ; they will consequently know to what they have to trust , and the fate that attends them , in case of rebellion . 
We will affirm to them , upon our honor , that M. Fouquet is a prisoner , and that all resistance can only be prejudicial to them . 
We will tell them that at the first cannon fired , there will be no further hope of mercy from the king . 
Then , or so at least I trust , they will resist no longer . 
They will yield up without fighting , and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue . '' 
The officer who had followed D'Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to speak , but D'Artagnan interrupted him . 
`` Yes , I know what you are going to tell me , monsieur ; I know that there is an order of the king 's to prevent all secret communications with the defenders of Belle-Isle , and that is exactly why I do not offer to communicate except in presence of my staff . '' 
And D'Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers , who knew him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension . 
The officers looked at each other as if to read each other 's opinions in their eyes , with the intention of evidently acting , should they agree , according to the desire of D'Artagnan . 
And already the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos and Aramis , when the king 's officer drew from a pocket a folded paper , which he placed in the hands of D'Artagnan . 
This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1 . 
`` What , more ! '' 
murmured the surprised captain . 
`` Read , monsieur , '' said the officer , with a courtesy that was not free from sadness . 
D'Artagnan , full of mistrust , unfolded the paper , and read these words : `` Prohibition to M. d'Artagnan to assemble any council whatever , or to deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners shot . 
Signed - LOUIS . '' 
D'Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole body , and with a gracious smile : `` That is well , monsieur , '' said he ; `` the king 's orders shall be complied with . '' 
: Result of the Ideas of the King , and the Ideas of D'Artagnan . 
The blow was direct . 
It was severe , mortal . 
D'Artagnan , furious at having been anticipated by an idea of the king 's , did not despair , however , even yet ; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle , he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the king has charged some other than myself with his secret orders , it must be because I no longer possess his confidence , and I should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions . 
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king . 
I tender it before you all , enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of France , in such a way as not to compromise the safety of the forces his majesty has confided to me . 
For this purpose , return all to your posts ; within an hour , we shall have the ebb of the tide . 
To your posts , gentlemen ! 
I suppose , '' added he , on seeing that all prepared to obey him , except the surveillant officer , `` you have no orders to object , this time ? '' 
And D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words . 
This plan would prove the safety of his friends . 
The blockade once raised , they might embark immediately , and set sail for England or Spain , without fear of being molested . 
Whilst they were making their escape , D'Artagnan would return to the king ; would justify his return by the indignation which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him ; he would be sent back with full powers , and he would take Belle-Isle ; that is to say , the cage , after the birds had flown . 
But to this plan the officer opposed a further order of the king 's . 
It was thus conceived : `` From the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving in his resignation , he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the expedition , and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to no longer obey him . 
Moreover , the said Monsieur d'Artagnan , having lost that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle , shall set out immediately for France , accompanied by the officer who will have remitted the message to him , and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he is answerable . '' 
Brave and careless as he was , D'Artagnan turned pale . 
Everything had been calculated with a depth of precognition which , for the first time in thirty years , recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible logic of the great cardinal . 
He leaned his head on his hand , thoughtful , scarcely breathing . 
`` If I were to put this order in my pocket , '' thought he , `` who would know it , what would prevent my doing it ? 
Before the king had had time to be informed , I should have saved those poor fellows yonder . 
Let us exercise some small audacity ! 
My head is not one of those the executioner strikes off for disobedience . 
We will disobey ! '' 
But at the moment he was about to adopt this plan , he saw the officers around him reading similar orders , which the passive agent of the thoughts of that infernal Colbert had distributed to them . 
This contingency of his disobedience had been foreseen - as all the rest had been . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the officer , coming up to him , `` I await your good pleasure to depart . '' 
`` I am ready , monsieur , '' replied D'Artagnan , grinding his teeth . 
The officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d'Artagnan and himself . 
At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage . 
`` How , '' stammered he , `` will you carry on the directions of the different corps ? '' 
`` When you are gone , monsieur , '' replied the commander of the fleet , `` it is to me the command of the whole is committed . '' 
`` Then , monsieur , '' rejoined Colbert 's man , addressing the new leader , `` it is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended . 
Let us see your powers . '' 
`` Here they are , '' said the officer , exhibiting the royal signature . 
`` Here are your instructions , '' replied the officer , placing the folded paper in his hands ; and turning round towards D'Artagnan , `` Come , monsieur , '' said he , in an agitated voice -LRB- such despair did he behold in that man of iron -RRB- , `` do me the favor to depart at once . '' 
`` Immediately ! '' 
articulated D'Artagnan , feebly , subdued , crushed by implacable impossibility . 
And he painfully subsided into the little boat , which started , favored by wind and tide , for the coast of France . 
The king 's guards embarked with him . 
The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes quickly , and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough to incline the king to mercy . 
The bark flew like a swallow . 
D'Artagnan distinctly saw the land of France profiled in black against the white clouds of night . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , to the officer to whom , for an hour , he had ceased speaking , `` what would I give to know the instructions for the new commander ! 
They are all pacific , are they not ? 
and - '' He did not finish ; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the waves , another , and two or three still louder . 
D'Artagnan shuddered . 
`` They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle , '' replied the officer . 
The canoe had just touched the soil of France . 
: The Ancestors of Porthos . 
When D'Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos , the latter returned to the principal fort , in order to converse with greater liberty . 
Porthos , still thoughtful , was a restraint on Aramis , whose mind had never felt itself more free . 
`` Dear Porthos , '' said he , suddenly , `` I will explain D'Artagnan 's idea to you . '' 
`` What idea , Aramis ? '' 
`` An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours . '' 
`` Ah ! 
indeed ! '' 
said Porthos , much astonished . 
`` Let us hear it . '' 
`` Did you remark , in the scene our friend had with the officer , that certain orders constrained him with regard to us ? '' 
`` Yes , I did notice that . '' 
`` Well ! 
D'Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king , and during the confusion that will result from his absence , we will get away , or rather you will get away , Porthos , if there is possibility of flight for only one . '' 
Here Porthos shook his head and replied : `` We will escape together , Aramis , or we will stay together . '' 
`` Thine is a right , a generous heart , '' said Aramis , `` only your melancholy uneasiness affects me . '' 
`` I am not uneasy , '' said Porthos . 
`` Then you are angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you . '' 
`` Then why , my friend , do you put on such a dismal countenance ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; I am making my will . '' 
And while saying these words , the good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis . 
`` Your will ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
`` What , then ! 
do you think yourself lost ? '' 
`` I feel fatigued . 
It is the first time , and there is a custom in our family . '' 
`` What is it , my friend ? '' 
`` My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` then your grandfather must have been Samson himself . '' 
`` No ; his name was Antoine . 
Well ! 
he was about my age , when , setting out one day for the chase , he felt his legs weak , the man who had never known what weakness was before . '' 
`` What was the meaning of that fatigue , my friend ? '' 
`` Nothing good , as you will see ; for having set out , complaining still of weakness of the legs , he met a wild boar , which made head against him ; he missed him with his arquebuse , and was ripped up by the beast and died immediately . '' 
`` There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself , dear Porthos . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you will see . 
My father was as strong again as I am . 
He was a rough soldier , under Henry III . 
and Henry IV. ; his name was not Antoine , but Gaspard , the same as M. de Coligny . 
Always on horseback , he had never known what lassitude was . 
One evening , as he rose from table , his legs failed him . '' 
`` He had supped heartily , perhaps , '' said Aramis , `` and that was why he staggered . '' 
`` Bah ! 
A friend of M. de Bassompierre , nonsense ! 
No , no , he was astonished at this lassitude , and said to my mother , who laughed at him , ` Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar , as the late M. du Vallon , my father did ? ' '' 
`` Well ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Well , having this weakness , my father insisted upon going down into the garden , instead of going to bed ; his foot slipped on the first stair , the staircase was steep ; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed . 
The hinge gashed his temple ; and he was stretched out dead upon the spot . '' 
Aramis raised his eyes to his friend : `` These are two extraordinary circumstances , '' said he ; `` let us not infer that there may succeed a third . 
It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious , my brave Porthos . 
Besides , when were your legs known to fail ? 
Never have you stood so firm , so haughtily ; why , you could carry a house on your shoulders . '' 
`` At this moment , '' said Porthos , `` I feel myself pretty active ; but at times I vacillate ; I sink ; and lately this phenomenon , as you say , has occurred four times . 
I will not say this frightens me , but it annoys me . 
Life is an agreeable thing . 
I have money ; I have fine estates ; I have horses that I love ; I have also friends that I love : D'Artagnan , Athos , Raoul , and you . '' 
The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship . 
Aramis pressed his hand : `` We will still live many years , '' said he , `` to preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men . 
Trust yourself to me , my friend ; we have no reply from D'Artagnan , that is a good sign . 
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas . 
On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! '' 
`` That is a grand idea . 
What shall we gain by it ? '' 
`` We shall gain this - nobody knows that grotto , or rather its issue , except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island ; we shall gain this - that if the island is occupied , the scouts , seeing no bark upon the shore , will never imagine we can escape , and will cease to watch . '' 
`` I understand . '' 
`` Well ! 
that weakness in the legs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
better , much , just now . '' 
`` You see , then , plainly , that everything conspires to give us quietude and hope . 
D'Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free . 
No royal fleet or descent to be dreaded . 
Vive Dieu ! 
Porthos , we have still half a century of magnificent adventure before us , and if I once touch Spanish ground , I swear to you , '' added the bishop with terrible energy , `` that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be . '' 
`` We live by hope , '' said Porthos , enlivened by the warmth of his companion . 
All at once a cry resounded in their ears : `` To arms ! 
to arms ! '' 
This cry , repeated by a hundred throats , piercing the chamber where the two friends were conversing , carried surprise to one , and uneasiness to the other . 
Aramis opened the window ; he saw a crowd of people running with flambeaux . 
Women were seeking places of safety , the armed population were hastening to their posts . 
`` The fleet ! 
the fleet ! '' 
cried a soldier , who recognized Aramis . 
`` The fleet ? '' 
repeated the latter . 
`` Within half cannon-shot , '' continued the soldier . 
`` To arms ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` To arms ! '' 
repeated Porthos , formidably . 
And both rushed forth towards the mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries . 
Boats , laden with soldiers , were seen approaching ; and in three directions , for the purpose of landing at three points at once . 
`` What must be done ? '' 
said an officer of the guard . 
`` Stop them ; and if they persist , fire ! '' 
said Aramis . 
Five minutes later , the cannonade commenced . 
These were the shots that D'Artagnan had heard as he landed in France . 
But the boats were too near the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly . 
They landed , and the combat commenced hand to hand . 
`` What 's the matter , Porthos ? '' 
said Aramis to his friend . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
- only my legs ; it is really incomprehensible ! 
- they will be better when we charge . '' 
In fact , Porthos and Aramis did charge with such vigor , and so thoroughly animated their men , that the royalists re-embarked precipitately , without gaining anything but the wounds they carried away . 
`` Eh ! 
but Porthos , '' cried Aramis , `` we must have a prisoner , quick ! 
quick ! '' 
Porthos bent over the stair of the mole , and seized by the nape of the neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to embark till all his people should be in the boat . 
The arm of the giant lifted up his prey , which served him as a buckler , and he recovered himself without a shot being fired at him . 
`` Here is a prisoner for you , '' said Porthos coolly to Aramis . 
`` Well ! '' 
cried the latter , laughing , `` did you not calumniate your legs ? '' 
`` It was not with my legs I captured him , '' said Porthos , `` it was with my arms ! '' 
: The Son of Biscarrat . 
The Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory ; Aramis did not encourage them in the feeling . 
`` What will happen , '' said he to Porthos , when everybody was gone home , `` will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the resistance ; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when they are taken , which can not fail to take place . '' 
`` From which it results , then , '' said Porthos , `` that what we have done is of not the slightest use . '' 
`` For the moment it may be , '' replied the bishop , `` for we have a prisoner from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do . '' 
`` Yes , let us interrogate the prisoner , '' said Porthos , `` and the means of making him speak are very simple . 
We are going to supper ; we will invite him to join us ; as he drinks he will talk . '' 
This was done . 
The officer was at first rather uneasy , but became reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with . 
He gave , without having any fear of compromising himself , all the details imaginable of the resignation and departure of D'Artagnan . 
He explained how , after that departure , the new leader of the expedition had ordered a surprise upon Belle-Isle . 
There his explanations stopped . 
Aramis and Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair . 
No more dependence to be placed now on D'Artagnan 's fertile imagination - no further resource in the event of defeat . 
Aramis , continuing his interrogations , asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle . 
`` The orders are , '' replied he , `` to kill during combat , or hang afterwards . '' 
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other again , and the color mounted to their faces . 
`` I am too light for the gallows , '' replied Aramis ; `` people like me are not hung . '' 
`` And I am too heavy , '' said Porthos ; `` people like me break the cord . '' 
`` I am sure , '' said the prisoner , gallantly , `` that we could have guaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred . '' 
`` A thousand thanks ! '' 
said Aramis , seriously . 
Porthos bowed . 
`` One more cup of wine to your health , '' said he , drinking himself . 
From one subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged . 
He was an intelligent gentleman , and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of Aramis 's wit and Porthos 's cordial bonhomie . 
`` Pardon me , '' said he , `` if I address a question to you ; but men who are in their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little . '' 
`` Address it ! '' 
cried Porthos ; `` address it ! '' 
`` Speak , '' said Aramis . 
`` Were you not , gentlemen , both in the musketeers of the late king ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , and amongst the best of them , if you please , '' said Porthos . 
`` That is true ; I should say even the best of all soldiers , messieurs , if I did not fear to offend the memory of my father . '' 
`` Of your father ? '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` Do you know what my name is ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
no , monsieur ; but you can tell us , and - '' `` I am called Georges de Biscarrat . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Do you remember that name , Aramis ? '' 
`` Biscarrat ! '' 
reflected the bishop . 
`` It seems to me - '' `` Try to recollect , monsieur , '' said the officer . 
`` Pardieu ! 
that wo n't take me long , '' said Porthos . 
`` Biscarrat - called Cardinal - one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we formed our friendship with D'Artagnan , sword in hand . '' 
`` Precisely , gentlemen . '' 
`` The only one , '' cried Aramis , eagerly , `` we could not scratch . '' 
`` Consequently , a capital blade ? '' 
said the prisoner . 
`` That 's true ! 
most true ! '' 
exclaimed both friends together . 
`` Ma foi ! 
Monsieur Biscarrat , we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a brave man 's son . '' 
Biscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers . 
Aramis looked at Porthos as much as to say , `` Here is a man who will help us , '' and without delay , - `` Confess , monsieur , '' said he , `` that it is good to have once been a good man . '' '' 
`` My father always said so , monsieur . '' 
`` Confess , likewise , that it is a sad circumstance in which you find yourself , of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung , and to learn that these men are old acquaintances , in fact , hereditary friends . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that , messieurs and friends ! '' 
said the young man , warmly . 
`` Bah ! 
you said so yourself . '' 
`` I said so just now , when I did not know you ; but now that I know you , I say - you will evade this dismal fate , if you wish ! '' 
`` How - if we wish ? '' 
echoed Aramis , whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos . 
`` Provided , '' continued Porthos , looking , in his turn , with noble intrepidity , at M. Biscarrat and the bishop - `` provided nothing disgraceful be required of us . '' 
`` Nothing at all will be required of you , gentlemen , '' replied the officer - `` what should they ask of you ? 
If they find you they will kill you , that is a predetermined thing ; try , then , gentlemen , to prevent their finding you . '' 
`` I do n't think I am mistaken , '' said Porthos , with dignity ; `` but it appears evident to me that if they want to find us , they must come and seek us here . '' 
`` In that you are perfectly right , my worthy friend , '' replied Aramis , constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat , who had grown silent and constrained . 
`` You wish , Monsieur de Biscarrat , to say something to us , to make us some overture , and you dare not - is that true ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
gentlemen and friends ! 
it is because by speaking I betray the watchword . 
But , hark ! 
I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it . '' 
`` Cannon ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Cannon and musketry , too ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
On hearing at a distance , among the rocks , these sinister reports of a combat which they thought had ceased : `` What can that be ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
Pardieu ! '' 
cried Aramis ; `` that is just what I expected . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint ; is not that true , monsieur ? 
And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed , you were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the island . '' 
`` Oh ! 
several , monsieur . '' 
`` We are lost , then , '' said the bishop of Vannes , quietly . 
`` Lost ! 
that is possible , '' replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , `` but we are not taken or hung . '' 
And so saying , he rose from the table , went to the wall , and coolly took down his sword and pistols , which he examined with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle , and who feels that life , in a great measure , depends upon the excellence and right conditions of his arms . 
At the report of the cannon , at the news of the surprise which might deliver up the island to the royal troops , the terrified crowd rushed precipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their leaders . 
Aramis , pale and downcast , between two flambeaux , showed himself at the window which looked into the principal court , full of soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor . 
`` My friends , '' said D'Herblay , in a grave and sonorous voice , `` M. Fouquet , your protector , your friend , you father , has been arrested by an order of the king , and thrown into the Bastile . '' 
A sustained yell of vengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood , and enveloped him in a magnetic field . 
`` Avenge Monsieur Fouquet ! '' 
cried the most excited of his hearers , `` death to the royalists ! '' 
`` No , my friends , '' replied Aramis , solemnly ; `` no , my friends ; no resistance . 
The king is master in his kingdom . 
The king is the mandatory of God . 
The king and God have struck M. Fouquet . 
Humble yourselves before the hand of God . 
Love God and the king , who have struck M. Fouquet . 
But do not avenge your seigneur , do not think of avenging him . 
You would sacrifice yourselves in vain - you , your wives and children , your property , your liberty . 
Lay down your arms , my friends - lay down your arms ! 
since the king commands you so to do - and retire peaceably to your dwellings . 
It is I who ask you to do so ; it is I who beg you to do so ; it is I who now , in the hour of need , command you to do so , in the name of M. Fouquet . '' 
The crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and terror . 
`` The soldiers of Louis XIV . 
have reached the island , '' continued Aramis . 
`` From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them and you - it would be a massacre . 
Begone , then , begone , and forget ; this time I command you , in the name of the Lord of Hosts ! '' 
The mutineers retired slowly , submissive , silent . 
`` Ah ! 
what have you just been saying , my friend ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Biscarrat to the bishop , `` you may save all these inhabitants , but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend . '' 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said the bishop of Vannes , with a singular accent of nobility and courtesy , `` Monsieur de Biscarrat , be kind enough to resume your liberty . '' 
`` I am very willing to do so , monsieur ; but - '' `` That would render us a service , for when announcing to the king 's lieutenant the submission of the islanders , you will perhaps obtain some grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has been effected . '' 
`` Grace ! '' 
replied Porthos with flashing eyes , `` what is the meaning of that word ? '' 
Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly , as he had been accustomed to do in the days of their youth , when he wanted to warn Porthos that he had committed , or was about to commit , a blunder . 
Porthos understood him , and was silent immediately . 
`` I will go , messieurs , '' replied Biscarrat , a little surprised likewise at the word `` grace '' pronounced by the haughty musketeer , of and to whom , but a few minutes before , he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic exploits with which his father had delighted him . 
`` Go , then , Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said Aramis , bowing to him , `` and at parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude . '' 
`` But you , messieurs , you whom I think it an honor to call my friends , since you have been willing to accept that title , what will become of you in the meantime ? '' 
replied the officer , very much agitated at taking leave of the two ancient adversaries of his father . 
`` We will wait here . '' 
`` But , mon Dieu ! 
- the order is precise and formal . '' 
`` I am bishop of Vannes , Monsieur de Biscarrat ; and they no more shoot a bishop than they hang a gentleman . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , monsieur - yes , monseigneur , '' replied Biscarrat ; `` it is true , you are right , there is still that chance for you . 
Then , I will depart , I will repair to the commander of the expedition , the king 's lieutenant . 
Adieu ! 
then , messieurs , or rather , to meet again , I hope . '' 
The worthy officer , jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis , departed in the direction of the sound of cannon , which , by surging the crowd into the fort , had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their prisoner . 
Aramis watched the departure , and when left alone with Porthos : `` Well , do you comprehend ? '' 
said he . 
`` Ma foi ! 
no . '' 
`` Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here ? '' 
`` No ; he is a brave fellow . '' 
`` Yes ; but the grotto of Locmaria - is it necessary all the world should know it ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is true , that is true ; I comprehend . 
We are going to escape by the cavern . '' 
`` If you please , '' cried Aramis , gayly . 
`` Forward , friend Porthos ; our boat awaits us . 
King Louis has not caught us - yet . '' 
: The Grotto of Locmaria . 
The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it . 
Besides , night was advancing ; midnight had struck at the fort . 
Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms . 
They walked , then , across the heath , which stretched between the mole and the cavern , listening to every noise , in order better to avoid an ambush . 
From time to time , on the road which they had carefully left on their left , passed fugitives coming from the interior , at the news of the landing of the royal troops . 
Aramis and Porthos , concealed behind some projecting mass of rock , collected the words that escaped from the poor people , who fled , trembling , carrying with them their most valuable effects , and tried , whilst listening to their complaints , to gather something from them for their own interest . 
At length , after a rapid race , frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages , they reached the deep grottoes , in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season . 
`` My good friend , '' said Porthos , panting vigorously , `` we have arrived , it seems . 
But I thought you spoke of three men , three servants , who were to accompany us . 
I do n't see them - where are they ? '' 
`` Why should you see them , Porthos ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern , and , no doubt , are resting , having accomplished their rough and difficult task . '' 
Aramis stopped Porthos , who was preparing to enter the cavern . 
`` Will you allow me , my friend , '' said he to the giant , `` to pass in first ? 
I know the signal I have given to these men ; who , not hearing it , would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark . '' 
`` Go on , then , Aramis ; go on - go first ; you impersonate wisdom and foresight ; go . 
Ah ! 
there is that fatigue again , of which I spoke to you . 
It has just seized me afresh . '' 
Aramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto , and bowing his head , he penetrated into the interior of the cavern , imitating the cry of the owl . 
A little plaintive cooing , a scarcely distinct echo , replied from the depths of the cave . 
Aramis pursued his way cautiously , and soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered , within ten paces of him . 
`` Are you there , Yves ? '' 
said the bishop . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; Goenne is here likewise . 
His son accompanies us . '' 
`` That is well . 
Are all things ready ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Go to the entrance of the grottoes , my good Yves , and you will there find the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , who is resting after the fatigue of our journey . 
And if he should happen not to be able to walk , lift him up , and bring him hither to me . '' 
The three men obeyed . 
But the recommendation given to his servants was superfluous . 
Porthos , refreshed , had already commenced the descent , and his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities , formed and supported by columns of porphyry and granite . 
As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had rejoined the bishop , the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were furnished , and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again as ever . 
`` Let us inspect the boat , '' said Aramis , `` and satisfy ourselves at once what it will hold . '' 
`` Do not go too near with the light , '' said the patron Yves ; `` for as you desired me , monseigneur , I have placed under the bench of the poop , in the coffer you know of , the barrel of powder , and the musket-charges that you sent me from the fort . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Aramis ; and , taking the lantern himself , he examined minutely all parts of the canoe , with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger . 
The canoe was long , light , drawing little water , thin of keel ; in short , one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle ; a little high in its sides , solid upon the water , very manageable , furnished with planks which , in uncertain weather , formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide , so as to protect the rowers . 
In two well-closed coffers , placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop , Aramis found bread , biscuit , dried fruits , a quarter of bacon , a good provision of water in leathern bottles ; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit the coast , and would be able to revictual , if necessity commanded . 
The arms , eight muskets , and as many horse-pistols , were in good condition , and all loaded . 
There were additional oars , in case of accident , and that little sail called trinquet , which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row , and is so useful when the breeze is slack . 
When Aramis had seen to all these things , and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection , `` Let us consult Porthos , '' said he , `` to know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto , following the descent and the shade of the cavern , or whether it be better , in the open air , to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes , leveling the road of the little beach , which is but twenty feet high , and gives , at high tide , three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom . '' 
`` It must be as you please , monseigneur , '' replied the skipper Yves , respectfully ; `` but I do n't believe that by the slope of the cavern , and in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat , the road will be so convenient as the open air . 
I know the beach well , and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden ; the interior of the grotto , on the contrary , is rough ; without reckoning , monseigneur , that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea , and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it . '' 
`` I have made my calculation , '' said the bishop , `` and I am certain it will pass . '' 
`` So be it ; I wish it may , monseigneur , '' continued Yves ; `` but your highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench , there is an enormous stone to be lifted - that under which the fox always passes , and which closes the trench like a door . '' 
`` It can be raised , '' said Porthos ; `` that is nothing . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men , '' replied Yves ; `` but that is giving him a great deal of trouble . '' 
`` I think the skipper may be right , '' said Aramis ; `` let us try the open-air passage . '' 
`` The more so , monseigneur , '' continued the fisherman , `` that we should not be able to embark before day , it will require so much labor , and that as soon as daylight appears , a good vedette placed outside the grotto would be necessary , indispensable even , to watch the maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us . '' 
`` Yes , yes , Yves , your reasons are good ; we will go by the beach . '' 
And the three robust Bretons went to the boat , and were beginning to place their rollers underneath it to put it in motion , when the distant barking of dogs was heard , proceeding from the interior of the island . 
Aramis darted out of the grotto , followed by Porthos . 
Dawn just tinted with purple and white the waves and plain ; through the dim light , melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles , and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering fields of buckwheat . 
In a quarter of an hour it would be clear daylight ; the wakened birds announced it to all nature . 
The barkings which had been heard , which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat , and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern , now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league of the grotto . 
`` It is a pack of hounds , '' said Porthos ; `` the dogs are on a scent . '' 
`` Who can be hunting at such a moment as this ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` And this way , particularly , '' continued Porthos , `` where they might expect the army of the royalists . '' 
`` The noise comes nearer . 
Yes , you are right , Porthos , the dogs are on a scent . 
But , Yves ! '' 
cried Aramis , `` come here ! 
come here ! '' 
Yves ran towards him , letting fall the cylinder which he was about to place under the boat when the bishop 's call interrupted him . 
`` What is the meaning of this hunt , skipper ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , I can not understand it , '' replied the Breton . 
`` It is not at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt . 
No , and yet the dogs - '' `` Unless they have escaped from the kennel . '' 
`` No , '' said Goenne , `` they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria 's hounds . '' 
`` In common prudence , '' said Aramis , `` let us go back into the grotto ; the voices evidently draw nearer , we shall soon know what we have to trust to . '' 
They re-entered , but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the darkness , when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress resounded through the cavern , and breathless , rapid , terrified , a fox passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives , leaped over the boat and disappeared , leaving behind its sour scent , which was perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave . 
`` The fox ! '' 
cried the Bretons , with the glad surprise of born hunters . 
`` Accursed mischance ! '' 
cried the bishop , `` our retreat is discovered . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
said Porthos ; `` are you afraid of a fox ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
my friend , what do you mean by that ? 
why do you specify the fox ? 
It is not the fox alone . 
Pardieu ! 
But do n't you know , Porthos , that after the foxes come hounds , and after hounds men ? '' 
Porthos hung his head . 
As though to confirm the words of Aramis , they heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail . 
Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath , with mingling yelps of triumph . 
`` There are the dogs , plain enough ! '' 
said Aramis , posted on the look-out behind a chink in the rocks ; `` now , who are the huntsmen ? '' 
`` If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria 's , '' replied the sailor , `` he will leave the dogs to hunt the grotto , for he knows them , and will not enter in himself , being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side ; it is there he will wait for him . '' 
`` It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting , '' replied Aramis , turning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance . 
`` Who is it , then ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Look ! '' 
Porthos applied his eye to the slit , and saw at the summit of a hillock a dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs , shouting , `` Taiaut ! 
taiaut ! '' 
`` The guards ! '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , my friend , the king 's guards . '' 
`` The king 's guards ! 
do you say , monseigneur ? '' 
cried the Bretons , growing pale in turn . 
`` With Biscarrat at their head , mounted upon my gray horse , '' continued Aramis . 
The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche , and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries . 
`` Ah ! 
the devil ! '' 
said Aramis , resuming all his coolness at the sight of this certain , inevitable danger . 
`` I am perfectly satisfied we are lost , but we have , at least , one chance left . 
If the guards who follow their hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto , there is no help for us , for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat . 
The dogs must not go out of the cavern . 
Their masters must not enter . '' 
`` That is clear , '' said Porthos . 
`` You understand , '' added Aramis , with the rapid precision of command ; `` there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under which the fox has glided - but at the too narrow opening of which they must be themselves stopped and killed . '' 
The Bretons sprang forward , knife in hand . 
In a few minutes there was a lamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls - and then , silence . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
said Aramis , coolly , `` now for the masters ! '' 
`` What is to be done with them ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Wait their arrival , conceal ourselves , and kill them . '' 
`` Kill them ! '' 
replied Porthos . 
`` There are sixteen , '' said Aramis , `` at least , at present . '' 
`` And well armed , '' added Porthos , with a smile of consolation . 
`` It will last about ten minutes , '' said Aramis . 
`` To work ! '' 
And with a resolute air he took up a musket , and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth . 
`` Yves , Goenne , and his son , '' continued Aramis , will pass the muskets to us . 
You , Porthos , will fire when they are close . 
We shall have brought down , at the lowest computation , eight , before the others are aware of anything - that is certain ; then all , there are five of us , will dispatch the other eight , knife in hand . '' 
`` And poor Biscarrat ? '' 
said Porthos . 
Aramis reflected a moment - `` Biscarrat first , '' replied he , coolly . 
`` He knows us . '' 
: The Grotto . 
In spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the character of Aramis , the event , subject to the risks of things over which uncertainty presides , did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had foreseen . 
Biscarrat , better mounted than his companions , arrived first at the opening of the grotto , and comprehended that fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it . 
Only , struck by that superstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man , he stopped at the outside of the grotto , and waited till his companions should have assembled round him . 
`` Well ! '' 
asked the young men , coming up , out of breath , and unable to understand the meaning of this inaction . 
`` Well ! 
I can not hear the dogs ; they and the fox must all be lost in this infernal cavern . '' 
`` They were too close up , '' said one of the guards , `` to have lost scent all at once . 
Besides , we should hear them from one side or another . 
They must , as Biscarrat says , be in this grotto . '' 
`` But then , '' said one of the young men , `` why do n't they give tongue ? '' 
`` It is strange ! '' 
muttered another . 
`` Well , but , '' said a fourth , `` let us go into this grotto . 
Does it happen to be forbidden we should enter it ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat . 
`` Only , as it looks as dark as a wolf 's mouth , we might break our necks in it . '' 
`` Witness the dogs , '' said a guard , `` who seem to have broken theirs . '' 
`` What the devil can have become of them ? '' 
asked the young men in chorus . 
And every master called his dog by his name , whistled to him in his favorite mode , without a single one replying to either call or whistle . 
`` It is perhaps an enchanted grotto , '' said Biscarrat ; `` let us see . '' 
And , jumping from his horse , he made a step into the grotto . 
`` Stop ! 
stop ! 
I will accompany you , '' said one of the guards , on seeing Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern 's mouth . 
`` No , '' replied Biscarrat , `` there must be something extraordinary in the place - do n't let us risk ourselves all at once . 
If in ten minutes you do not hear of me , you can come in , but not all at once . '' 
`` Be it so , '' said the young man , who , besides , did not imagine that Biscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise , `` we will wait for you . '' 
And without dismounting from their horses , they formed a circle round the grotto . 
Biscarrat entered then alone , and advanced through the darkness till he came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos 's musket . 
The resistance which his chest met with astonished him ; he naturally raised his hand and laid hold of the icy barrel . 
At the same instant , Yves lifted a knife against the young man , which was about to fall upon him with all force of a Breton 's arm , when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way . 
Then , like low muttering thunder , his voice growled in the darkness , `` I will not have him killed ! '' 
Biscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat , the one almost as terrible as the other . 
However brave the young man might be , he could not prevent a cry escaping him , which Aramis immediately suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth . 
`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said he , in a low voice , `` we mean you no harm , and you must know that if you have recognized us ; but , at the first word , the first groan , the first whisper , we shall be forced to kill you as we have killed your dogs . '' 
`` Yes , I recognize you , gentlemen , '' said the officer , in a low voice . 
`` But why are you here - what are you doing , here ? 
Unfortunate men ! 
I thought you were in the fort . '' 
`` And you , monsieur , you were to obtain conditions for us , I think ? '' 
`` I did all I was able , messieurs , but - '' `` But what ? '' 
`` But there are positive orders . '' 
`` To kill us ? '' 
Biscarrat made no reply . 
It would have cost him too much to speak of the cord to gentlemen . 
Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner . 
`` Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said he , `` you would be already dead if we had not regard for your youth and our ancient association with your father ; but you may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your companions what you have seen . '' 
`` I will not only swear that I will not speak of it , '' said Biscarrat , `` but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto . '' 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried several voices from the outside , coming like a whirlwind into the cave . 
`` Reply , '' said Aramis . 
`` Here I am ! '' 
cried Biscarrat . 
`` Now , begone ; we depend on your loyalty . '' 
And he left his hold of the young man , who hastily returned towards the light . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the voices , still nearer . 
And the shadows of several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto . 
Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them , and met them just as they were adventuring into the cave . 
Aramis and Porthos listened with the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
exclaimed one of the guards , as he came to the light , `` how pale you are ! '' 
`` Pale ! '' 
cried another ; `` you ought to say corpse-color . '' 
`` I ! '' 
said the young man , endeavoring to collect his faculties . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
what has happened ? '' 
exclaimed all the voices . 
`` You have not a drop of blood in your veins , my poor friend , '' said one of them , laughing . 
`` Messieurs , it is serious , '' said another , `` he is going to faint ; does any one of you happen to have any salts ? '' 
And they all laughed . 
This hail of jests fell round Biscarrat 's ears like musket-balls in a melee . 
He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations . 
`` What do you suppose I have seen ? ' 
asked he . 
`` I was too hot when I entered the grotto , and I have been struck with a chill . 
That is all . '' 
`` But the dogs , the dogs ; have you seen them again - did you see anything of them - do you know anything about them ? '' 
`` I suppose they have got out some other way . '' 
`` Messieurs , '' said one of the young men , `` there is in that which is going on , in the paleness and silence of our friend , a mystery which Biscarrat will not , or can not reveal . 
Only , and this is certain , Biscarrat has seen something in the grotto . 
Well , for my part , I am very curious to see what it is , even if it is the devil ! 
To the grotto ! 
messieurs , to the grotto ! '' 
`` To the grotto ! '' 
repeated all the voices . 
And the echo of the cavern carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis , `` To the grotto ! 
to the grotto ! '' 
Biscarrat threw himself before his companions . 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! '' 
cried he , `` in the name of Heaven ! 
do not go in ! '' 
`` Why , what is there so terrific in the cavern ? '' 
asked several at once . 
`` Come , speak , Biscarrat . '' 
`` Decidedly , it is the devil he has seen , '' repeated he who had before advanced that hypothesis . 
`` Well , '' said another , `` if he has seen him , he need not be selfish ; he may as well let us have a look at him in turn . '' 
`` Messieurs ! 
messieurs ! 
I beseech you , '' urged Biscarrat . 
`` Nonsense ! 
Let us pass ! '' 
`` Messieurs , I implore you not to enter ! '' 
`` Why , you went in yourself . '' 
Then one of the officers , who - of a riper age than the others - had till this time remained behind , and had said nothing , advanced . 
`` Messieurs , '' said he , with a calmness which contrasted with the animation of the young men , `` there is in there some person , or something , that is not the devil ; but which , whatever it may be , has had sufficient power to silence our dogs . 
We must discover who this some one is , or what this something is . '' 
Biscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends , but it was useless . 
In vain he threw himself before the rashest ; in vain he clung to the rocks to bar the passage ; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave , in the steps of the officer who had spoken last , but who had sprung in first , sword in hand , to face the unknown danger . 
Biscarrat , repulsed by his friends , unable to accompany them , without passing in the eyes of Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer , with painfully attentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers . 
As to the guards , they penetrated further and further , with exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced . 
All at once , a discharge of musketry , growling like thunder , exploded in the entrails of the vault . 
Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning . 
At the same instant , cries , shrieks , imprecations burst forth , and the little troop of gentlemen reappeared - some pale , some bleeding - all enveloped in a cloud of smoke , which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern . 
`` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
cried the fugitives , `` you knew there was an ambuscade in that cavern , and you did not warn us ! 
Biscarrat , you are the cause that four of us are murdered men ! 
Woe be to you , Biscarrat ! '' 
`` You are the cause of my being wounded unto death , '' said one of the young men , letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm , and spattering it into Biscarrat 's livid face . 
`` My blood be on your head ! '' 
And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man . 
`` But , at least , tell us who is there ? '' 
cried several furious voices . 
Biscarrat remained silent . 
`` Tell us , or die ! '' 
cried the wounded man , raising himself upon one knee , and lifting towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword . 
Biscarrat rushed towards him , opening his breast for the blow , but the wounded man fell back not to rise again , uttering a groan which was his last . 
Biscarrat , with hair on end , haggard eyes , and bewildered head , advanced towards the interior of the cavern , saying , `` You are right . 
Death to me , who have allowed my comrades to be assassinated . 
I am a worthless wretch ! '' 
And throwing away his sword , for he wished to die without defending himself , he rushed head foremost into the cavern . 
The others followed him . 
The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his example ; but they did not go further than the first . 
A second discharge laid five upon the icy sand ; and as it was impossible to see whence this murderous thunder issued , the others fell back with a terror that can be better imagined than described . 
But , far from flying , as the others had done , Biscarrat remained safe and sound , seated on a fragment of rock , and waited . 
There were only six gentlemen left . 
`` Seriously , '' said one of the survivors , `` is it the devil ? '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
it is much worse , '' said another . 
`` Ask Biscarrat , he knows . '' 
`` Where is Biscarrat ? '' 
The young men looked round them , and saw that Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` He is dead ! '' 
said two or three voices . 
`` Oh ! 
no ! '' 
replied another , `` I saw him through the smoke , sitting quietly on a rock . 
He is in the cavern ; he is waiting for us . '' 
`` He must know who are there . '' 
`` And how should he know them ? '' 
`` He was taken prisoner by the rebels . '' 
`` That is true . 
Well ! 
let us call him , and learn from him whom we have to deal with . '' 
And all voices shouted , `` Biscarrat ! 
Biscarrat ! '' 
But Biscarrat did not answer . 
`` Good ! '' 
said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair . 
`` We have no longer any need of him ; here are reinforcements coming . '' 
In fact , a company of guards , left in the rear by their officers , whom the ardor of the chase had carried away - from seventy-five to eighty men - arrived in good order , led by their captain and the first lieutenant . 
The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers ; and , in language the eloquence of which may be easily imagined , they related the adventure , and asked for aid . 
The captain interrupted them . 
`` Where are your companions ? '' 
demanded he . 
`` Dead ! '' 
`` But there were sixteen of you ! '' 
`` Ten are dead . 
Biscarrat is in the cavern , and we are five . '' 
`` Biscarrat is a prisoner ? '' 
`` Probably . '' 
`` No , for here he is - look . '' 
In fact , Biscarrat appeared at the opening of the grotto . 
`` He is making a sign to come on , '' said the officer . 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
cried all the troop . 
And they advanced to meet Biscarrat . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the captain , addressing Biscarrat , `` I am assured that you know who the men are in that grotto , and who make such a desperate defense . 
In the king 's name I command you to declare what you know . '' 
`` Captain , '' said Biscarrat , `` you have no need to command me . 
My word has been restored to me this very instant ; and I came in the name of these men . '' 
`` To tell me who they are ? '' 
`` To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death , unless you grant them satisfactory terms . '' 
`` How many are there of them , then ? '' 
`` There are two , '' said Biscarrat . 
`` There are two - and want to impose conditions upon us ? '' 
`` There are two , and they have already killed ten of our men . '' 
`` What sort of people are they - giants ? '' 
`` Worse than that . 
Do you remember the history of the Bastion Saint - Gervais , captain ? '' 
`` Yes ; where four musketeers held out against an army . '' 
`` Well , these are two of those same musketeers . '' 
`` And their names ? '' 
`` At that period they were called Porthos and Aramis . 
Now they are styled M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon . '' 
`` And what interest have they in all this ? '' 
`` It is they who were holding Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet . '' 
A murmur ran through the ranks of the soldiers on hearing the two words `` Porthos and Aramis . '' 
`` The musketeers ! 
the musketeers ! '' 
repeated they . 
And among all these brave men , the idea that they were going to have a struggle against two of the oldest glories of the French army , made a shiver , half enthusiasm , two-thirds terror , run through them . 
In fact , those four names - D'Artagnan , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis - were venerated among all who wore a sword ; as , in antiquity , the names of Hercules , Theseus , Castor , and Pollux were venerated . 
`` Two men - and they have killed ten in two discharges ! 
It is impossible , Monsieur Biscarrat ! '' 
`` Eh ! 
captain , '' replied the latter , `` I do not tell you that they have not with them two or three men , as the musketeers of the Bastion Saint - Gervais had two or three lackeys ; but , believe me , captain , I have seen these men , I have been taken prisoner by them - I know they themselves alone are all-sufficient to destroy an army . '' 
`` That we shall see , '' said the captain , `` and that in a moment , too . 
Gentlemen , attention ! '' 
At this reply , no one stirred , and all prepared to obey . 
Biscarrat alone risked a last attempt . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , `` be persuaded by me ; let us pass on our way . 
Those two men , those two lions you are going to attack , will defend themselves to the death . 
They have already killed ten of our men ; they will kill double the number , and end by killing themselves rather than surrender . 
What shall we gain by fighting them ? '' 
`` We shall gain the consciousness , monsieur , of not having allowed eighty of the king 's guards to retire before two rebels . 
If I listened to your advice , monsieur , I should be a dishonored man ; and by dishonoring myself I should dishonor the army . 
Forward , my men ! '' 
And he marched first as far as the opening of the grotto . 
There he halted . 
The object of this halt was to give Biscarrat and his companions time to describe to him the interior of the grotto . 
Then , when he believed he had a sufficient acquaintance with the place , he divided his company into three bodies , which were to enter successively , keeping up a sustained fire in all directions . 
No doubt , in this attack they would lose five more , perhaps ten ; but , certainly , they must end by taking the rebels , since there was no issue ; and , at any rate , two men could not kill eighty . 
`` Captain , '' said Biscarrat , `` I beg to be allowed to march at the head of the first platoon . '' 
`` So be it , '' replied the captain ; `` you have all the honor . 
I make you a present of it . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
replied the young man , with all the firmness of his race . 
`` Take your sword , then . '' 
`` I shall go as I am , captain , '' said Biscarrat , `` for I do not go to kill , I go to be killed . '' 
And placing himself at the head of the first platoon , with head uncovered and arms crossed , - `` March , gentlemen , '' said he . 
: An Homeric Song . 
It is time to pass to the other camp , and to describe at once the combatants and the field of battle . 
Aramis and Porthos had gone to the grotto of Locmaria with the expectation of finding there their canoe ready armed , as well as the three Bretons , their assistants ; and they at first hoped to make the bark pass through the little issue of the cavern , concealing in that fashion both their labors and their flight . 
The arrival of the fox and dogs obliged them to remain concealed . 
The grotto extended the space of about a hundred toises , to that little slope dominating a creek . 
Formerly a temple of the Celtic divinities , when Belle-Isle was still called Kalonese , this grotto had beheld more than one human sacrifice accomplished in its mystic depths . 
The first entrance to the cavern was by a moderate descent , above which distorted rocks formed a weird arcade ; the interior , very uneven and dangerous from the inequalities of the vault , was subdivided into several compartments , which communicated with each other by means of rough and jagged steps , fixed right and left , in uncouth natural pillars . 
At the third compartment the vault was so low , the passage so narrow , that the bark would scarcely have passed without touching the side ; nevertheless , in moments of despair , wood softens and stone grows flexible beneath the human will . 
Such was the thought of Aramis , when , after having fought the fight , he decided upon flight - a flight most dangerous , since all the assailants were not dead ; and that , admitting the possibility of putting the bark to sea , they would have to fly in open day , before the conquered , so interested on recognizing their small number , in pursuing their conquerors . 
When the two discharges had killed ten men , Aramis , familiar with the windings of the cavern , went to reconnoiter them one by one , and counted them , for the smoke prevented seeing outside ; and he immediately commanded that the canoe should be rolled as far as the great stone , the closure of the liberating issue . 
Porthos collected all his strength , took the canoe in his arms , and raised it up , whilst the Bretons made it run rapidly along the rollers . 
They had descended into the third compartment ; they had arrived at the stone which walled the outlet . 
Porthos seized this gigantic stone at its base , applied his robust shoulder , and gave a heave which made the wall crack . 
A cloud of dust fell from the vault , with the ashes of ten thousand generations of sea birds , whose nests stuck like cement to the rock . 
At the third shock the stone gave way , and oscillated for a minute . 
Porthos , placing his back against the neighboring rock , made an arch with his foot , which drove the block out of the calcareous masses which served for hinges and cramps . 
The stone fell , and daylight was visible , brilliant , radiant , flooding the cavern through the opening , and the blue sea appeared to the delighted Bretons . 
They began to lift the bark over the barricade . 
Twenty more toises , and it would glide into the ocean . 
It was during this time that the company arrived , was drawn up by the captain , and disposed for either an escalade or an assault . 
Aramis watched over everything , to favor the labors of his friends . 
He saw the reinforcements , counted the men , and convinced himself at a single glance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would expose them . 
To escape by sea , at the moment the cavern was about to be invaded , was impossible . 
In fact , the daylight which had just been admitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark being rolled towards the sea , the two rebels within musket-shot ; and one of their discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the navigators . 
Besides , allowing everything , - if the bark escaped with the men on board of it , how could the alarm be suppressed - how could notice to the royal lighters be prevented ? 
What could hinder the poor canoe , followed by sea and watched from the shore , from succumbing before the end of the day ? 
Aramis , digging his hands into his gray hair with rage , invoked the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons . 
Calling to Porthos , who was doing more work than all the rollers - whether of flesh or wood - `` My friend , '' said he , `` our adversaries have just received a reinforcement . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Porthos , quietly , `` what is to be done , then ? '' 
`` To recommence the combat , '' said Aramis , `` is hazardous . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Porthos , `` for it is difficult to suppose that out of two , one should not be killed ; and certainly , if one of us was killed , the other would get himself killed also . '' 
Porthos spoke these words with that heroic nature which , with him , grew grander with necessity . 
Aramis felt it like a spur to his heart . 
`` We shall neither of us be killed if you do what I tell you , friend Porthos . '' 
`` Tell me what ? '' 
`` These people are coming down into the grotto . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` We could kill about fifteen of them , but no more . '' 
`` How many are there in all ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men . '' 
`` Seventy-five and five , eighty . 
Ah ! '' 
sighed Porthos . 
`` If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls . '' 
`` Certainly they will . '' 
`` Without reckoning , '' added Aramis , `` that the detonation might occasion a collapse of the cavern . '' 
`` Ay , '' said Porthos , `` a piece of falling rock just now grazed my shoulder . '' 
`` You see , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is nothing . '' 
`` We must determine upon something quickly . 
Our Bretons are going to continue to roll the canoe towards the sea . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
`` We two will keep the powder , the balls , and the muskets here . '' 
`` But only two , my dear Aramis - we shall never fire three shots together , '' said Porthos , innocently , `` the defense by musketry is a bad one . '' 
`` Find a better , then . '' 
`` I have found one , '' said the giant , eagerly ; `` I will place myself in ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar , and invisible , unattackable , if they come in floods , I can let my bar fall upon their skulls , thirty times in a minute . 
Hein ! 
what do you think of the project ? 
You smile ! '' 
`` Excellent , dear friend , perfect ! 
I approve it greatly ; only you will frighten them , and half of them will remain outside to take us by famine . 
What we want , my good friend , is the entire destruction of the troop . 
A single survivor encompasses our ruin . '' 
`` You are right , my friend , but how can we attract them , pray ? '' 
`` By not stirring , my good Porthos . '' 
`` Well ! 
we wo n't stir , then ; but when they are all together - '' `` Then leave it to me , I have an idea . '' 
`` If it is so , and your idea proves a good one - and your idea is most likely to be good - I am satisfied . '' 
`` To your ambuscade , Porthos , and count how many enter . '' 
`` But you , what will you do ? '' 
`` Do n't trouble yourself about me ; I have a task to perform . '' 
`` I think I hear shouts . '' 
`` It is they ! 
To your post . 
Keep within reach of my voice and hand . '' 
Porthos took refuge in the second compartment , which was in darkness , absolutely black . 
Aramis glided into the third ; the giant held in his hand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight . 
Porthos handled this lever , which had been used in rolling the bark , with marvelous facility . 
During this time , the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach . 
In the further and lighter compartment , Aramis , stooping and concealed , was busy with some mysterious maneuver . 
A command was given in a loud voice . 
It was the last order of the captain commandant . 
Twenty-five men jumped from the upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto , and having taken their ground , began to fire . 
The echoes shrieked and barked , the hissing balls seemed actually to rarefy the air , and then opaque smoke filled the vault . 
`` To the left ! 
to the left ! '' 
cried Biscarrat , who , in his first assault , had seen the passage to the second chamber , and who , animated by the smell of powder , wished to guide his soldiers in that direction . 
The troop , accordingly , precipitated themselves to the left - the passage gradually growing narrower . 
Biscarrat , with his hands stretched forward , devoted to death , marched in advance of the muskets . 
`` Come on ! 
come on ! '' 
exclaimed he , `` I see daylight ! '' 
`` Strike , Porthos ! '' 
cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis . 
Porthos breathed a heavy sigh - but he obeyed . 
The iron bar fell full and direct upon the head of Biscarrat , who was dead before he had ended his cry . 
Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds , and made ten corpses . 
The soldiers could see nothing ; they heard sighs and groans ; they stumbled over dead bodies , but as they had no conception of the cause of all this , they came forward jostling each other . 
The implacable bar , still falling , annihilated the first platoon , without a single sound to warn the second , which was quietly advancing ; only , commanded by the captain , the men had stripped a fir , growing on the shore , and , with its resinous branches twisted together , the captain had made a flambeau . 
On arriving at the compartment where Porthos , like the exterminating angel , had destroyed all he touched , the first rank drew back in terror . 
No firing had replied to that of the guards , and yet their way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies - they literally walked in blood . 
Porthos was still behind his pillar . 
The captain , illumining with trembling pine-torch this frightful carnage , of which he in vain sought the cause , drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was concealed . 
Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade , and fastened on the throat of the captain , who uttered a stifle rattle ; his stretched-out arms beating the air , the torch fell and was extinguished in blood . 
A second after , the corpse of the captain dropped close to the extinguished torch , and added another body to the heap of dead which blocked up the passage . 
All this was effected as mysteriously as though by magic . 
At hearing the rattling in the throat of the captain , the soldiers who accompanied him had turned round , caught a glimpse of his extended arms , his eyes starting from their sockets , and then the torch fell and they were left in darkness . 
From an unreflective , instinctive , mechanical feeling , the lieutenant cried : `` Fire ! '' 
Immediately a volley of musketry flamed , thundered , roared in the cavern , bringing down enormous fragments from the vaults . 
The cavern was lighted for an instant by this discharge , and then immediately returned to pitchy darkness rendered thicker by the smoke . 
To this succeeded a profound silence , broken only by the steps of the third brigade , now entering the cavern . 
: The Death of a Titan . 
At the moment when Porthos , more accustomed to the darkness than these men , coming from open daylight , was looking round him to see if through this artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal , he felt his arm gently touched , and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear , `` Come . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis , if possible , yet more softly . 
And amidst the noise of the third brigade , which continued to advance , the imprecations of the guards still left alive , the muffled groans of the dying , Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the cavern . 
Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment , and showed him , in a hollow of the rocky wall , a barrel of powder weighing from seventy to eighty pounds , to which he had just attached a fuse . 
`` My friend , '' said he to Porthos , `` you will take this barrel , the match of which I am going to set fire to , and throw it amidst our enemies ; can you do so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
replied Porthos ; and he lifted the barrel with one hand . 
`` Light it ! '' 
`` Stop , '' said Aramis , `` till they are all massed together , and then , my Jupiter , hurl your thunderbolt among them . '' 
`` Light it , '' repeated Porthos . 
`` On my part , '' continued Aramis , `` I will join our Bretons , and help them to get the canoe to the sea . 
I will wait for you on the shore ; launch it strongly , and hasten to us . '' 
`` Light it , '' said Porthos , a third time . 
`` But do you understand me ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Porthos again , with laughter that he did not even attempt to restrain , `` when a thing is explained to me I understand it ; begone , and give me the light . '' 
Aramis gave the burning match to Porthos , who held out his arm to him , his hands being engaged . 
Aramis pressed the arm of Porthos with both his hands , and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where the three rowers awaited him . 
Porthos , left alone , applied the spark bravely to the match . 
The spark - a feeble spark , first principle of conflagration - shone in the darkness like a glow-worm , then was deadened against the match which it set fire to , Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath . 
The smoke was a little dispersed , and by the light of the sparkling match objects might , for two seconds , be distinguished . 
It was a brief but splendid spectacle , that of this giant , pale , bloody , his countenance lighted by the fire of the match burning in surrounding darkness ! 
The soldiers saw him , they saw the barrel he held in his hand - they at once understood what was going to happen . 
Then , these men , already choked with horror at the sight of what had been accomplished , filled with terror at thought of what was about to be accomplished , gave out a simultaneous shriek of agony . 
Some endeavored to fly , but they encountered the third brigade , which barred their passage ; others mechanically took aim and attempted to fire their discharged muskets ; others fell instinctively upon their knees . 
Two or three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his liberty if he would spare their lives . 
The lieutenant of the third brigade commanded his men to fire ; but the guards had before them their terrified companions , who served as a living rampart for Porthos . 
We have said that the light produced by the spark and the match did not last more than two seconds ; but during these two seconds this is what it illumined : in the first place , the giant , enlarged in the darkness ; then , at ten paces off , a heap of bleeding bodies , crushed , mutilated , in the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony , lifting the mass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying in the night . 
Every breath of Porthos , thus vivifying the match , sent towards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent aura , mingled with streaks of purple . 
In addition to this principal group scattered about the grotto , as the chances of death or surprise had stretched them , isolated bodies seemed to be making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds . 
Above ground , bedded in pools of blood , rose , heavy and sparkling , the short , thick pillars of the cavern , of which the strongly marked shades threw out the luminous particles . 
And all this was seen by the tremulous light of a match attached to a barrel of powder , that is to say , a torch which , whilst throwing a light on the dead past , showed death to come . 
As I have said , this spectacle did not last above two seconds . 
During this short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together eight men armed with muskets , and , through an opening , ordered them to fire upon Porthos . 
But they who received the order to fire trembled so that three guards fell by the discharge , and the five remaining balls hissed on to splinter the vault , plow the ground , or indent the pillars of the cavern . 
A burst of laughter replied to this volley ; then the arm of the giant swung round ; then was seen whirling through the air , like a falling star , the train of fire . 
The barrel , hurled a distance of thirty feet , cleared the barricade of dead bodies , and fell amidst a group of shrieking soldiers , who threw themselves on their faces . 
The officer had followed the brilliant train in the air ; he endeavored to precipitate himself upon the barrel and tear out the match before it reached the powder it contained . 
Useless ! 
The air had made the flame attached to the conductor more active ; the match , which at rest might have burnt five minutes , was consumed in thirty seconds , and the infernal work exploded . 
Furious vortices of sulphur and nitre , devouring shoals of fire which caught every object , the terrible thunder of the explosion , this is what the second which followed disclosed in that cavern of horrors . 
The rocks split like planks of deal beneath the axe . 
A jet of fire , smoke , and debris sprang from the middle of the grotto , enlarging as it mounted . 
The large walls of silex tottered and fell upon the sand , and the sand itself , an instrument of pain when launched from its hard bed , riddled the faces with its myriad cutting atoms . 
Shrieks , imprecations , human life , dead bodies - all were engulfed in one terrific crash . 
The three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell grimly back , in the order of their weight , every vegetable , mineral , or human fragment . 
Then the lighter sand and ash came down in turn , stretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal scene . 
And now , in this burning tomb , this subterranean volcano , seek the king 's guards with their blue coats laced with silver . 
Seek the officers , brilliant in gold , seek for the arms upon which they depended for their defense . 
One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more confused , more shapeless , more terrible than the chaos which existed before the creation of the world . 
There remained nothing of the three compartments - nothing by which God could have recognized His handiwork . 
As for Porthos , after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his enemies , he had fled , as Aramis had directed him to do , and had gained the last compartment , into which air , light , and sunshine penetrated through the opening . 
Scarcely had he turned the angle which separated the third compartment from the fourth when he perceived at a hundred paces from him the bark dancing on the waves . 
There were his friends , there liberty , there life and victory . 
Six more of his formidable strides , and he would be out of the vault ; out of the vault ! 
a dozen of his vigorous leaps and he would reach the canoe . 
Suddenly he felt his knees give way ; his knees seemed powerless , his legs to yield beneath him . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
murmured he , `` there is my weakness seizing me again ! 
I can walk no further ! 
What is this ? '' 
Aramis perceived him through the opening , and unable to conceive what could induce him to stop thus - `` Come on , Porthos ! 
come on , '' he cried ; `` come quickly ! '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied the giant , making an effort that contorted every muscle of his body - `` oh ! 
but I can not . '' 
While saying these words , he fell upon his knees , but with his mighty hands he clung to the rocks , and raised himself up again . 
`` Quick ! 
quick ! '' 
repeated Aramis , bending forward towards the shore , as if to draw Porthos towards him with his arms . 
`` Here I am , '' stammered Porthos , collecting all his strength to make one step more . 
`` In the name of Heaven ! 
Porthos , make haste ! 
the barrel will blow up ! '' 
`` Make haste , monseigneur ! '' 
shouted the Bretons to Porthos , who was floundering as in a dream . 
But there was no time ; the explosion thundered , earth gaped , the smoke which hurled through the clefts obscured the sky ; the sea flowed back as though driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if from the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera ; the reflux took the bark out twenty toises ; the solid rocks cracked to their base , and separated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge ; a portion of the vault was carried up towards heaven , as if it had been built of cardboard ; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of liquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome of smoke ; then oscillated , declined , and fell successively the mighty monoliths of rock which the violence of the explosion had not been able to uproot from the bed of ages ; they bowed to each other like grave and stiff old men , then prostrating themselves , lay down forever in their dusty tomb . 
This frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had lost ; he arose , a giant among granite giants . 
But at the moment he was flying between the double hedge of granite phantoms , these latter , which were no longer supported by the corresponding links , began to roll and totter round our Titan , who looked as if precipitated from heaven amidst rocks which he had just been launching . 
Porthos felt the very earth beneath his feet becoming jelly-tremulous . 
He stretched both hands to repulse the falling rocks . 
A gigantic block was held back by each of his extended arms . 
He bent his head , and a third granite mass sank between his shoulders . 
For an instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail him , but this new Hercules united all his force , and the two walls of the prison in which he was buried fell back slowly and gave him place . 
For an instant he appeared , in this frame of granite , like the angel of chaos , but in pushing back the lateral rocks , he lost his point of support , for the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders , and the boulder , pressing upon him with all its weight , brought the giant down upon his knees . 
The lateral rocks , for an instant pushed back , drew together again , and added their weight to the ponderous mass which would have been sufficient to crush ten men . 
The hero fell without a groan - he fell while answering Aramis with words of encouragement and hope , for , thanks to the powerful arch of his hands , for an instant he believed that , like Enceladus , he would succeed in shaking off the triple load . 
But by degrees Aramis beheld the block sink ; the hands , strung for an instant , the arms stiffened for a last effort , gave way , the extended shoulders sank , wounded and torn , and the rocks continued to gradually collapse . 
`` Porthos ! 
Porthos ! '' 
cried Aramis , tearing his hair . 
`` Porthos ! 
where are you ? 
Speak ! '' 
`` Here , here , '' murmured Porthos , with a voice growing evidently weaker , `` patience ! 
patience ! '' 
Scarcely had he pronounced these words , when the impulse of the fall augmented the weight ; the enormous rock sank down , pressed by those others which sank in from the sides , and , as it were , swallowed up Porthos in a sepulcher of badly jointed stones . 
On hearing the dying voice of his friend , Aramis had sprung to land . 
Two of the Bretons followed him , with each a lever in his hand - one being sufficient to take care of the bark . 
The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided them amidst the ruins . 
Aramis , animated , active and young as at twenty , sprang towards the triple mass , and with his hands , delicate as those of a woman , raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great granite grave . 
Then he caught a glimpse , through the darkness of that charnel-house , of the still brilliant eye of his friend , to whom the momentary lifting of the mass restored a momentary respiration . 
The two men came rushing up , grasped their iron levers , united their triple strength , not merely to raise it , but sustain it . 
All was useless . 
They gave way with cries of grief , and the rough voice of Porthos , seeing them exhaust themselves in a useless struggle , murmured in an almost cheerful tone those supreme words which came to his lips with the last respiration , `` Too heavy ! '' 
After which his eyes darkened and closed , his face grew ashy pale , the hands whitened , and the colossus sank quite down , breathing his last sigh . 
With him sank the rock , which , even in his dying agony he had still held up . 
The three men dropped the levers , which rolled upon the tumulary stone . 
Then , breathless , pale , his brow covered with sweat , Aramis listened , his breast oppressed , his heart ready to break . 
Nothing more . 
The giant slept the eternal sleep , in the sepulcher which God had built about him to his measure . 
: Porthos 's Epitaph . 
Aramis , silent and sad as ice , trembling like a timid child , arose shivering from the stone . 
A Christian does not walk on tombs . 
But , though capable of standing , he was not capable of walking . 
It might be said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him . 
His Bretons surrounded him ; Aramis yielded to their kind exertions , and the three sailors , lifting him up , carried him to the canoe . 
Then , having laid him down upon the bench near the rudder , they took to their oars , preferring this to hoisting sail , which might betray them . 
On all that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria , one single hillock attracted their eyes . 
Aramis never removed his from it ; and , at a distance out in the sea , in proportion as the shore receded , that menacing proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up , as formerly Porthos used to draw himself up , raising a smiling , yet invincible head towards heaven , like that of his dear old honest valiant friend , the strongest of the four , yet the first dead . 
Strange destiny of these men of brass ! 
The most simple of heart allied to the most crafty ; strength of body guided by subtlety of mind ; and in the decisive moment , when vigor alone could save mind and body , a stone , a rock , a vile material weight , triumphed over manly strength , and falling upon the body , drove out the mind . 
Worthy Porthos ! 
born to help other men , always ready to sacrifice himself for the safety of the weak , as if God had only given him strength for that purpose ; when dying he only thought he was carrying out the conditions of his compact with Aramis , a compact , however , which Aramis alone had drawn up , and which Porthos had only known to suffer by its terrible solidarity . 
Noble Porthos ! 
of what good now are thy chateaux overflowing with sumptuous furniture , forests overflowing with game , lakes overflowing with fish , cellars overflowing with wealth ! 
Of what service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries , and in the midst of them Mousqueton , proud of the power delegated by thee ! 
Oh , noble Porthos ! 
careful heaper-up of treasure , was it worth while to labor to sweeten and gild life , to come upon a desert shore , surrounded by the cries of seagulls , and lay thyself , with broken bones , beneath a torpid stone ? 
Was it worth while , in short , noble Porthos , to heap so much gold , and not have even the distich of a poor poet engraven upon thy monument ? 
Valiant Porthos ! 
he still , without doubt , sleeps , lost , forgotten , beneath the rock the shepherds of the heath take for the gigantic abode of a dolmen . 
And so many twining branches , so many mosses , bent by the bitter wind of ocean , so many lichens solder thy sepulcher to earth , that no passers-by will imagine such a block of granite could ever have been supported by the shoulders of one man . 
Aramis , still pale , still icy-cold , his heart upon his lips , looked , even till , with the last ray of daylight , the shore faded on the horizon . 
Not a word escaped him , not a sigh rose from his deep breast . 
The superstitious Bretons looked upon him , trembling . 
Such silence was not that of a man , it was the silence of a statue . 
In the meantime , with the first gray lines that lighted up the heavens , the canoe hoisted its little sail , which , swelling with the kisses of the breeze , and carrying them rapidly from the coast , made bravest way towards Spain , across the dreaded Gulf of Gascony , so rife with storms . 
But scarcely half an hour after the sail had been hoisted , the rowers became inactive , reclining on their benches , and , making an eye-shade with their hands , pointed out to each other a white spot which appeared on the horizon as motionless as a gull rocked by the viewless respiration of the waves . 
But that which might have appeared motionless to ordinary eyes was moving at a quick rate to the experienced eye of the sailor ; that which appeared stationary upon the ocean was cutting a rapid way through it . 
For some time , seeing the profound torpor in which their master was plunged , they did not dare to rouse him , and satisfied themselves with exchanging their conjectures in whispers . 
Aramis , in fact , so vigilant , so active - Aramis , whose eye , like that of the lynx , watched without ceasing , and saw better by night than by day - Aramis seemed to sleep in this despair of soul . 
An hour passed thus , during which daylight gradually disappeared , but during which also the sail in view gained so swiftly on the bark , that Goenne , one of the three sailors , ventured to say aloud : `` Monseigneur , we are being chased ! '' 
Aramis made no reply ; the ship still gained upon them . 
Then , of their own accord , two of the sailors , by the direction of the patron Yves , lowered the sail , in order that that single point upon the surface of the waters should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy pursuing them . 
On the part of the ship in sight , on the contrary , two more small sails were run up at the extremities of the masts . 
Unfortunately , it was the time of the finest and longest days of the year , and the moon , in all her brilliancy , succeeded inauspicious daylight . 
The balancelle , which was pursuing the little bark before the wind , had then still half an hour of twilight , and a whole night almost as light as day . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! 
we are lost ! '' 
said the captain . 
`` Look ! 
they see us plainly , though we have lowered sail . '' 
`` That is not to be wondered at , '' murmured one of the sailors , `` since they say that , by the aid of the devil , the Paris-folk have fabricated instruments with which they see as well at a distance as near , by night as well as by day . '' 
Aramis took a telescope from the bottom of the boat , focussed it silently , and passing it to the sailor , `` Here , '' said he , `` look ! '' 
The sailor hesitated . 
`` Do n't be alarmed , '' said the bishop , `` there is no sin in it ; and if there is any sin , I will take it on myself . '' 
The sailor lifted the glass to his eye , and uttered a cry . 
He believed that the vessel , which appeared to be distant about cannon-shot , had at a single bound cleared the whole distance . 
But , on withdrawing the instrument from his eye , he saw that , except the way which the balancelle had been able to make during that brief instant , it was still at the same distance . 
`` So , '' murmured the sailor , `` they can see us as we see them . '' 
`` They see us , '' said Aramis , and sank again into impassibility . 
`` What ! 
- they see us ! '' 
said Yves . 
`` Impossible ! '' 
`` Well , captain , look yourself , '' said the sailor . 
And he passed him the glass . 
`` Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this ? '' 
asked Yves . 
Aramis shrugged his shoulders . 
The skipper lifted the glass to his eye . 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , '' said he , `` it is a miracle - there they are ; it seems as if I were going to touch them . 
Twenty-five men at least ! 
Ah ! 
I see the captain forward . 
He holds a glass like this , and is looking at us . 
Ah ! 
he turns round , and gives an order ; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward - they are loading it - pointing it . 
Misericorde ! 
they are firing at us ! '' 
And by a mechanical movement , the skipper put aside the telescope , and the pursuing ship , relegated to the horizon , appeared again in its true aspect . 
The vessel was still at the distance of nearly a league , but the maneuver sighted thus was not less real . 
A light cloud of smoke appeared beneath the sails , more blue than they , and spreading like a flower opening ; then , at about a mile from the little canoe , they saw the ball take the crown off two or three waves , dig a white furrow in the sea , and disappear at the end of it , as inoffensive as the stone with which , in play , a boy makes ducks and drakes . 
It was at once a menace and a warning . 
`` What is to be done ? '' 
asked the patron . 
`` They will sink us ! '' 
said Goenne , `` give us absolution , monseigneur ! '' 
And the sailors fell on their knees before him . 
`` You forget that they can see you , '' said he . 
`` That is true ! '' 
said the sailors , ashamed of their weakness . 
`` Give us your orders , monseigneur , we are prepared to die for you . '' 
`` Let us wait , '' said Aramis . 
`` How - let us wait ? '' 
`` Yes ; do you not see , as you just now said , that if we endeavor to fly , they will sink us ? '' 
`` But , perhaps , '' the patron ventured to say , `` perhaps under cover of night , we could escape them . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Aramis , `` they have , no doubt , Greek fire with which to lighten their own course and ours likewise . '' 
At the same moment , as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of Aramis , a second cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens , and from the bosom of that cloud sparkled an arrow of flame , which described a parabola like a rainbow , and fell into the sea , where it continued to burn , illuminating a space of a quarter of a league in diameter . 
The Bretons looked at each other in terror . 
`` You see plainly , '' said Aramis , `` it will be better to wait for them . '' 
The oars dropped from the hands of the sailors , and the bark , ceasing to make way , rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves . 
Night came on , but still the ship drew nearer . 
It might be imagined it redoubled its speed with darkness . 
From time to time , as a vulture rears its head out of its nest , the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides , and cast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall . 
At last it came within musket-shot . 
All the men were on deck , arms in hand ; the cannoniers were at their guns , the matches burning . 
It might be thought they were about to board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in number to their own , not to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by four people . 
`` Surrender ! '' 
cried the commander of the balancelle , with the aid of his speaking-trumpet . 
The sailors looked at Aramis . 
Aramis made a sign with his head . 
Yves waved a white cloth at the end of a gaff . 
This was like striking their flag . 
The pursuer came on like a race-horse . 
It launched a fresh Greek fire , which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe , and threw a light upon them as white as sunshine . 
`` At the first sign of resistance , '' cried the commander of the balancelle , `` fire ! '' 
The soldiers brought their muskets to the present . 
`` Did we not say we surrendered ? '' 
said Yves . 
`` Alive , alive , captain ! '' 
cried one excited soldier , `` they must be taken alive . '' 
`` Well , yes - living , '' said the captain . 
Then turning towards the Bretons , `` Your lives are safe , my friends ! '' 
cried he , `` all but the Chevalier d'Herblay . '' 
Aramis stared imperceptibly . 
For an instant his eye was fixed upon the depths of the ocean , illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire , which ran along the sides of the waves , played on the crests like plumes , and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they covered . 
`` Do you hear , monseigneur ? '' 
said the sailors . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What are your orders ? '' 
`` Accept ! '' 
`` But you , monseigneur ? '' 
Aramis leaned still more forward , and dipped the ends of his long white fingers in the green limpid waters of the sea , to which he turned with smiles as to a friend . 
`` Accept ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` We accept , '' repeated the sailors ; `` but what security have we ? '' 
`` The word of a gentleman , '' said the officer . 
`` By my rank and by my name I swear that all except M. le Chevalier d'Herblay shall have their lives spared . 
I am lieutenant of the king 's frigate the ` Pomona , ' and my name is Louis Constant de Pressigny . '' 
With a rapid gesture , Aramis - already bent over the side of the bark towards the sea - drew himself up , and with a flashing eye , and a smile upon his lips , `` Throw out the ladder , messieurs , '' said he , as if the command had belonged to him . 
He was obeyed . 
When Aramis , seizing the rope ladder , walked straight up to the commander , with a firm step , looked at him earnestly , made a sign to him with his hand , a mysterious and unknown sign at sight of which the officer turned pale , trembled , and bowed his head , the sailors were profoundly astonished . 
Without a word Aramis then raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed him the collet of a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand . 
And while making this sign Aramis , draped in cold and haughty majesty , had the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed . 
The commandant , who for a moment had raised his head , bowed a second time with marks of the most profound respect . 
Then stretching his hand out , in his turn , towards the poop , that is to say , towards his own cabin , he drew back to allow Aramis to go first . 
The three Bretons , who had come on board after their bishop , looked at each other , stupefied . 
The crew were awed to silence . 
Five minutes after , the commander called the second lieutenant , who returned immediately , ordering the head to be put towards Corunna . 
Whilst this order was being executed , Aramis reappeared upon the deck , and took a seat near the bastingage . 
Night had fallen ; the moon had not yet risen , yet Aramis looked incessantly towards Belle-Isle . 
Yves then approached the captain , who had returned to take his post in the stern , and said , in a low and humble voice , `` What course are we to follow , captain ? '' 
`` We take what course monseigneur pleases , '' replied the officer . 
Aramis passed the night leaning upon the bastingage . 
Yves , on approaching him next morning , remarked that `` the night must have been a very damp one , for the wood on which the bishop 's head had rested was soaked with dew . '' 
Who knows ? 
- that dew was , it may be , the first tears that had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis ! 
What epitaph would have been worth that , good Porthos ? 
: M. de Gesvres 's Round . 
D'Artagnan was little used to resistance like that he had just experienced . 
He returned , profoundly irritated , to Nantes . 
Irritation , with this vigorous man , usually vented itself in impetuous attack , which few people , hitherto , were they king , were they giants , had been able to resist . 
Trembling with rage , he went straight to the castle , and asked an audience with the king . 
It might be about seven o'clock in the morning , and , since his arrival at Nantes , the king had been an early riser . 
But on arriving at the corridor with which we are acquainted , D'Artagnan found M. de Gesvres , who stopped him politely , telling him not to speak too loud and disturb the king . 
`` Is the king asleep ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Well , I will let him sleep . 
But about what o'clock do you suppose he will rise ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
in about two hours ; his majesty has been up all night . '' 
D'Artagnan took his hat again , bowed to M. de Gesvres , and returned to his own apartments . 
He came back at half-past nine , and was told that the king was at breakfast . 
`` That will just suit me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I will talk to the king while he is eating . '' 
M. de Brienne reminded D'Artagnan that the king would not see any one at meal-time . 
`` But , '' said D'Artagnan , looking askant at Brienne , `` you do not know , perhaps , monsieur , that I have the privilege of entree anywhere - and at any hour . '' 
Brienne took the captain 's hand kindly , and said , `` Not at Nantes , dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
The king , in this journey , has changed everything . '' 
D'Artagnan , a little softened , asked about what o'clock the king would have finished his breakfast . 
`` We do n't know . '' 
`` Eh ? 
- do n't know ! 
What does that mean ? 
You do n't know how much time the king devotes to eating ? 
It is generally an hour ; and , if we admit that the air of the Loire gives an additional appetite , we will extend it to an hour and a half ; that is enough , I think . 
I will wait where I am . '' 
`` Oh ! 
dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , the order of the day is not to allow any person to remain in this corridor ; I am on guard for that particular purpose . '' 
D'Artagnan felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time . 
He went out quickly , for fear of complicating the affair by a display of premature ill-humor . 
As soon as he was out he began to reflect . 
`` The king , '' said he , `` will not receive me , that is evident . 
The young man is angry ; he is afraid , beforehand , of the words that I may speak to him . 
Yes ; but in the meantime Belle-Isle is besieged , and my two friends by now probably taken or killed . 
Poor Porthos ! 
As to Master Aramis , he is always full of resources , and I am easy on his account . 
But , no , no ; Porthos is not yet an invalid , nor is Aramis in his dotage . 
The one with his arm , the other with his imagination , will find work for his majesty 's soldiers . 
Who knows if these brave men may not get up for the edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of Saint - Gervais ! 
I do n't despair of it . 
They have cannon and a garrison . 
And yet , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I do n't know whether it would not be better to stop the combat . 
For myself alone I will not put up with either surly looks or insults from the king ; but for my friends I must put up with everything . 
Shall I go to M. Colbert ? 
Now , there is a man I must acquire the habit of terrifying . 
I will go to M. Colbert . '' 
And D'Artagnan set forward bravely to find M. Colbert , but was informed that he was working with the king , at the castle of Nantes . 
`` Good ! '' 
cried he , `` the times have come again in which I measured my steps from De Treville to the cardinal , from the cardinal to the queen , from the queen to Louis XIII . 
Truly is it said that men , in growing old , become children again !
