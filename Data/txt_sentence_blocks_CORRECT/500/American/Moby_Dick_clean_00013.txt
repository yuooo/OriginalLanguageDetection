Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers , the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of English and American vessels , which , in those waters , have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged . 
With a fair , fresh wind , the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Java sea , and thence , cruising northwards , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale , sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands , and gain the far coast of Japan , in time for the great whaling season there . 
By these means , the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific ; where Ahab , though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick , in the sea he was most known to frequent ; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it . 
But how now ? 
in this zoned quest , does Ahab touch no land ? 
does his crew drink air ? 
Surely , he will stop for water . 
Nay . 
For a long time , now , the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what 's in himself . 
So Ahab . 
Mark this , too , in the whaler . 
While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be transferred to foreign wharves ; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants . 
She has a whole lake 's contents bottled in her ample hold . 
She is ballasted with utilities ; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge . 
She carries years ' water in her . 
Clear old prime Nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the Nantucketer , in the Pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the Peruvian or Indian streams . 
Hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to China from New York , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale-ship , in all that interval , may not have sighted one grain of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves . 
So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer -- `` Well , boys , here 's the ark ! '' 
Now , as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java , in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head , the look-outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake . 
But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried . 
Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us . 
But here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the Sperm Whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection . 
To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans , may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout ; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands . 
Broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air . 
Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , falls over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward . 
Seen from the Pequod 's deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapory spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height . 
As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains , accelerate their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle , and swimming on , in one solid , but still crescentic centre . 
Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats . 
If the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these Straits of Sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number . 
And who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese ! 
So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of Tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake . 
Corresponding to the crescent in our van , we beheld another in our rear . 
It seemed formed of detached white vapors , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing . 
Levelling his glass at this sight , Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole , crying , `` Aloft there , and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails ; -- Malays , sir , and after us ! '' 
As if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over-cautious delay . 
But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit , -- mere riding-whips and rowels to her , that they were . 
As with glass under arm , Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his . 
And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ; -- when all these conceits had passed through his brain , Ahab 's brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place . 
But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays . 
But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats . 
But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them , -- though as yet a mile in their rear , -- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity . 
Stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white-ash , and after several hours ' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied * . 
The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like King Porus ' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation . 
In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic . 
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea . 
Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay . 
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures . 
Though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman . 
Witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre 's pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter-skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death . 
Best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men . 
* To gally , or gallow , is to frighten excessively -- to confound with fright . 
It is an old Saxon word . 
It occurs once in Shakespeare : -- The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves . 
To common language , the word is now completely obsolete . 
When the polite landsman first hears it from the gaunt Nantucketer , he is apt to set it down as one of the whaleman 's self-derived savageries . 
Much the same is it with many other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort , which emigrated to New-England rocks with the noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time of the Commonwealth . 
Thus , some of the best and furthest-descended English words -- the etymological Howards and Percys -- are now democratised , nay , plebeianised -- so to speak -- in the New World . 
Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place . 
As is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal . 
In about three minutes ' time , Queequeg 's harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd . 
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . 
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb . 
As , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed . 
But not a bit daunted , Queequeg steered us manfully ; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance ; now edging away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , Starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones . 
Nor were the oarsmen quite idle , though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with . 
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business . 
`` Out of the way , Commodore ! '' 
cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us . 
`` Hard down with your tail , there ! '' 
cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity . 
All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs . 
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other 's grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon . 
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used . 
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time . 
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can . 
And if you can not kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure . 
Hence it is , that at times like these the drug , comes into requisition . 
Our boat was furnished with three of them . 
The first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg . 
They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball . 
But upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat 's bottom as the seat slid from under him . 
On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time . 
It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale 's way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning . 
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake . 
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt . 
In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods . 
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion . 
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs . 
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us . 
We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up . 
Keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host . 
Now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles . 
At any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon . 
I mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at . 
Like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them . 
Queequeg patted their foreheads ; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it . 
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side . 
For , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers . 
The lake , as I have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ; -- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight . 
Floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us . 
One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth . 
He was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar 's bow . 
The delicate side-fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby 's ears newly arrived from foreign parts . 
`` Line ! 
line ! '' 
cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; `` him fast ! 
him fast ! 
-- Who line him ! 
Who struck ? 
-- Two whale ; one big , one little ! '' 
`` What ails ye , man ? '' 
cried Starbuck . 
`` Look-e here , '' said Queequeg , pointing down . 
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam . 
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped . 
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond . 
We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep . 
* * The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob : -- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that . 
When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter 's lance , the mother 's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods . 
The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries . 
When overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute more hominum . 
And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments ; yea , serenely revelled in dalliance and delight . 
But even so , amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm ; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me , deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy . 
Meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them . 
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes . 
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon . 
It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again . 
A whale wounded -LRB- as we afterwards learned -RRB- in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went . 
But agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us . 
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail , the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh . 
So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades . 
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright . 
First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters . 
Yes , the long calm was departing . 
A low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring , the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain . 
Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places ; Starbuck taking the stern . 
`` Oars ! 
Oars ! '' 
he intensely whispered , seizing the helm -- `` gripe your oars , and clutch your souls , now ! 
My God , men , stand by ! 
Shove him off , you Queequeg -- the whale there ! 
-- prick him ! 
-- hit him ! 
Stand up -- stand up , and stay so ! 
Spring men -- pull , men ; never mind their backs -- scrape them ! 
-- scrape away ! '' 
The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths . 
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet . 
After many similar hair-breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre . 
This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg 's hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by . 
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness . 
Further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waited . 
The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near . 
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery , -- the more whales the less fish . 
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured . 
The rest contrived to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod . 
Schools and Schoolmasters The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations . 
Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached bands are occasionally observed , embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each . 
Such bands are known as schools . 
They generally are of two sorts ; those composed almost entirely of females , and those mustering none but young vigorous males , or bulls as they are familiarly designated . 
In cavalier attendance upon the school of females , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies . 
In truth , this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem . 
The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male . 
They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist . 
Nevertheless , it can not be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point . 
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings . 
Like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety . 
You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the Northern seas , and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth . 
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year . 
When serenely advancing on one of these journeys , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family . 
Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him , and chases him away ! 
High times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the Bashaw will , he can not keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed ; for alas ! 
all fish bed in common . 
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love . 
They fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers . 
Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters , -- furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths . 
But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem 's lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord . 
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines . 
Granting other whales to be in sight , the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks ; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small . 
As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help . 
For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named , my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery , however much for the bower ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world ; every baby an exotic . 
In good time , nevertheless , as the ardor of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors . 
Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster . 
It is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it . 
His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale , must have read the memoirs of Vidocq , and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days , and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils . 
The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales . 
Almost universally , a lone whale -- as a solitary Leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one . 
Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets . 
The schools composing none but young and vigorous males , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools . 
For while those female whales are characteristically timid , the young males , or forty-barrel-bulls , as they call them , are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans , and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter ; excepting those wondrous grey-headed , grizzled whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout . 
The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools . 
Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard . 
They soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three-fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems . 
Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes . 
Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull -- poor devil ! 
all his comrades quit him . 
But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey . 
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish The allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge . 
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies , all partaking of this one grand feature . 
For example , -- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line . 
Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases . 
Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of Holland . 
It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695 . 
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter . 
They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian 's Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People 's Business . 
Yes ; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne 's farthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they . 
I . 
A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it . 
II . 
A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it . 
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it . 
First : What is a Fast-Fish ? 
Alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants , -- a mast , an oar , a nine-inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same . 
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognized symbol of possession ; so long as the party wailing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do . 
These are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist . 
True , among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party . 
But others are by no means so scrupulous . 
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they -LRB- the plaintiffs -RRB- had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself . 
Ultimately the defendants -LRB- the crew of another ship -RRB- came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs . 
And when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure . 
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat . 
Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge . 
In the course of the defence , the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim . 
con . 
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife 's viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her . 
Erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose-fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman 's property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her . 
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other . 
These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit , -- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it -LRB- the fish -RRB- acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them . 
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs . 
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge , might possibly object to it . 
But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish , I say , will on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; For notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on . 
Is it not a saying in every one 's mouth , Possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ? 
But often possession is the whole of the law . 
What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish , whereof possession is the whole of the law ? 
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow 's last mite but a Fast-Fish ? 
What is yonder undetected villain 's marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif ; what is that but a Fast-Fish ? 
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai , the broker , gets from the poor Woebegone , the bankrupt , on a loan to keep Woebegone 's family from starvation ; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish ? 
What is the Archbishop of Savesoul 's income of 100,000 pounds seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers -LRB- all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul 's help -RRB- what is that globular 100,000 but a Fast-Fish . 
What are the Duke of Dunder 's hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish ? 
What to that redoubted harpooneer , John Bull , is poor Ireland , but a Fast-Fish ? 
What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast-Fish ? 
And concerning all these , is not Possession the whole of the law ? 
But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so . 
That is internationally and universally applicable . 
What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish , in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of wailing it for his royal master and mistress ? 
What was Poland to the Czar ? 
What Greece to the Turk ? 
What India to England ? 
What at last will Mexico be to the United States ? 
All Loose-Fish . 
What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish ? 
What all men 's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish ? 
What is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish ? 
What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish ? 
What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish ? 
And what are you , reader , but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish , too ? 
Heads or Tails `` De balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam . '' 
BRACTON , L. 3 , C. 3 . 
Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honorary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail . 
A division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder . 
Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast -- and Loose-Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty . 
In the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance-that happened within the last two years . 
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover , or Sandwich , or some one of the Cinque Ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore . 
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden . 
Holding the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his . 
By some writers this office is called a sinecure . 
But not so . 
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them . 
Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners , bare-footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good 150 pounds from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of Blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale 's head , he says -- `` Hands off ! 
this fish , my masters , is a Fast-Fish . 
I seize it as the Lord Warden 's . '' 
Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation -- so truly English -- knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round ; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger . 
But that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone . 
At length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak , `` Please , sir , who is the Lord Warden ? '' 
`` The Duke . '' 
`` But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke 's benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this whale . '' 
`` It is his . '' 
`` Wo n't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ? '' 
`` It is his . '' 
In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money . 
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration . 
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied -LRB- both letters were published -RRB- that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he -LRB- the reverend gentleman -RRB- would decline meddling with other people 's business . 
Is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ? 
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign . 
We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right . 
The law itself has already been set forth . 
But Plowdon gives us the reason for it . 
Says Plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , `` because of its superior excellence . '' 
And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters . 
But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ? 
A reason for that , ye lawyers ! 
In his treatise on `` Queen-Gold , '' or Queen-pin-money , an old King 's Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : `` Ye tail is ye Queen 's , that ye Queen 's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone . '' 
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ' bodices . 
But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne . 
But is the Queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ? 
An allegorical meaning may lurk here . 
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown 's ordinary revenue . 
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality . 
And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law . 
The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud `` In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan , insufferable fetor denying not inquiry . '' 
SIR T. BROWNE , V. E . 
It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapory , mid-day sea , that the many noses on the Pequod 's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft . 
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea . 
`` I will bet something now , '' said Stubb , `` that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day . 
I thought they would keel up before long . '' 
Presently , the vapors in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside . 
As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colors from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse . 
It may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed . 
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it . 
Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose . 
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first . 
In truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil . 
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general . 
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales . 
`` There 's a pretty fellow , now , '' he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship 's bows , `` there 's a jackal for ye ! 
I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get wo n't be enough to dip the Captain 's wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here 's a Crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there . 
Poor devil ! 
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let 's make him a present of a little oil for dear charity 's sake . 
For what oil he 'll get from that drugged whale there , would n't be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell . 
And as for the other whale , why , I 'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he 'll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris . 
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that . 
It 's worth trying . 
Yes , I 'm for it ; '' and so saying he started for the quarter-deck . 
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again . 
Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat 's crew , and pulled off for the stranger . 
Drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste , the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color . 
Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read `` Bouton de Rose , '' -- Rose-button , or Rose-bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship . 
Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription , yet the word rose , and the bulbous figure-head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him . 
`` A wooden rose-bud , eh ? '' 
he cried with his hand to his nose , `` that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells ! '' 
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it . 
Arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled -- `` Bouton-de-Rose , ahoy ! 
are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English ? '' 
`` Yes , '' rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief-mate . 
`` Well , then , my Bouton-de-Rose-bud , have you seen the White Whale ? '' 
`` What whale ? '' 
`` The White Whale -- a Sperm Whale -- Moby Dick , have ye seen him ? 
`` Never heard of such a whale . 
Cachalot Blanche ! 
White Whale -- no . '' 
`` Very good , then ; good bye now , and I 'll call again in a minute . '' 
Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted -- `` No , Sir ! 
No ! '' 
Upon which Ahab retired , and Stubb returned to the Frenchman . 
He now perceived that the Guernsey-man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting-spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag . 
`` What 's the matter with your nose , there ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Broke it ? '' 
`` I wish it was broken , or that I did n't have any nose at all ! '' 
answered the Guernsey-man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much . 
`` But what are you holding yours for ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing ! 
It 's a wax nose ; I have to hold it on . 
Fine day , ai n't it ? 
Air rather gardenny , I should say ; throw us a bunch of posies , will ye , Bouton-de-Rose ? '' 
`` What in the devil 's name do you want here ? '' 
roared the Guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion . 
`` Oh ! 
keep cool -- cool ? 
yes , that 's the word ! 
why do n't you pack those whales in ice while you 're working at 'em ? 
But joking aside , though ; do you know , Rose-bud , that it 's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ? 
As for that dried up one , there , he has n't a gill in his whole carcase . '' 
`` I know that well enough ; but , d'ye see , the Captain here wo n't believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a Cologne manufacturer before . 
But come aboard , and mayhap he 'll believe you , if he wo n't me ; and so I 'll get out of this dirty scrape . '' 
`` Anything to oblige ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow , '' rejoined Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck . 
There a queer scene presented itself . 
The sailors , in tasselled caps of red worsted , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales . 
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor . 
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms . 
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air . 
Some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal-tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils . 
Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories . 
Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain 's round-house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within . 
This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the Captain 's round-house -LRB- cabinet he called it -RRB- to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times . 
Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle . 
Sounding him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris . 
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity . 
According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey-man , under cover of an interpreter 's office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview . 
By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin . 
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side . 
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them . 
`` What shall I say to him first ? '' 
said he . 
`` Why , '' said Stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , `` you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though I do n't pretend to be a judge . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , '' said the Guernsey-man , in French , turning to his captain , `` that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief-mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside . '' 
Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more . 
`` What now ? '' 
said the Guernsey-man to Stubb . 
`` Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I 'm quite certain that he 's no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey . 
In fact , tell him from me he 's a baboon . '' 
`` He vows and declares , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish . '' 
Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship . 
`` What now ? '' 
said the Guernsey-man , when the Captain had returned to them . 
`` Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact , tell him I 've diddled him , and -LRB- aside to himself -RRB- perhaps somebody else . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , that he 's very happy to have been of any service to us . '' 
Hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties -LRB- meaning himself and mate -RRB- , and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux . 
`` He wants you to take a glass of wine with him , '' said the interpreter . 
`` Thank him heartily ; but tell him it 's against my principles to drink with the man I 've diddled . 
In fact , tell him I must go . '' 
`` He says , Monsieur , that his principles wo n't admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it 's so calm they wo n't drift . '' 
By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect , -- that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship 's side . 
While the Frenchman 's boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line . 
Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb 's whale . 
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning . 
Seizing his sharp boat-spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin . 
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam . 
His boat 's crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold-hunters . 
And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them . 
Stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time . 
`` I have it , I have it , '' cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , `` a purse ! 
a purse ! '' 
Dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal . 
You might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash color . 
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist . 
Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab 's loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good-bye . 
Ambergris Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject . 
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned . 
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct . 
For amber , though at times found on the sea-coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea . 
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth-pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair-powders , and pomatum . 
The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter 's in Rome . 
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it . 
Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale ! 
Yet so it is . 
By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale . 
How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth 's pills , and then running out of harm 's way , as laborers do in blasting rocks . 
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ' trousers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing , more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner . 
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ? 
Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonor , but raised in glory . 
And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk . 
Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor , Cologne-water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst . 
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but can not , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman 's two whales . 
Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly , untidy business . 
But there is another thing to rebut . 
They hint that all whales always smell bad . 
Now how did this odious stigma originate ? 
I opine , that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago . 
Because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , forbidding any other course . 
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard , for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital . 
I partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack , in his great work on Smells , a text-book on that subject . 
As its name imports -LRB- smeer , fat ; berg , to put up -RRB- , this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose . 
It was a collection of furnaces , fat-kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . 
But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . 
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose . 
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . 
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale 's flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . 
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ? 
Must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great ? 
The Castaway It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod 's crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own . 
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats . 
Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale . 
As a general thing , these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ' crews . 
But if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper . 
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name , Pip by abbreviation . 
Poor Pip ! 
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy-jolly . 
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough-Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar color , driven in one eccentric span . 
But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , Pip , though over tender-hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race . 
For blacks , the year 's calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year 's Days . 
Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king 's cabinets . 
But Pip loved life , and all life 's peaceable securities ; so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler 's frolic on the green ; and at melodious even-tide , with his gay ha-ha ! 
had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine . 
So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue-veined neck , the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases . 
Then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil-blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell . 
But let us to the story . 
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb 's after-oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place . 
The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful . 
Now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip 's seat . 
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water . 
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto ! 
poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck . 
Tashtego stood in the bows . 
He was full of the fire of the hunt . 
He hated Pip for a poltroon . 
Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , `` Cut ? '' 
Meantime Pip 's blue , choked face plainly looked , Do , for God 's sake ! 
All passed in a flash . 
In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened . 
`` Damn him , cut ! '' 
roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved . 
So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew . 
Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , Stubb then in a plain , business-like , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice . 
The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is . 
Now , in general , Stick to the boat , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat , is still better . 
Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command `` Stick to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I wo n't pick you up if you jump ; mind that . 
We ca n't afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama . 
Bear that in mind , and do n't jump any more . '' 
Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money-making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence . 
But we are all in the hands of the Gods ; and Pip jumped again . 
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller 's trunk . 
Alas ! 
Stubb was but too true to his word .
