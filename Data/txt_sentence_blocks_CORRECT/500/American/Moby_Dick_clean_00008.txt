The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs . 
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale . 
So look the long line of man-of-war 's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy 's ship . 
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale . 
With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air . 
The First Lowering The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there . 
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain 's , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter . 
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips . 
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff . 
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . 
Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ; -- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere . 
While yet the wondering ship 's company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head , `` All ready there , Fedallah ? '' 
`` Ready , '' was the half-hissed reply . 
`` Lower away then ; d'ye hear ? '' 
shouting across the deck . 
`` Lower away there , I say . '' 
Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off-handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat-like , leaped down the rolling ship 's side into the tossed boats below . 
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship 's lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large expanse of water . 
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command . 
`` Captain Ahab ? 
- '' said Starbuck . 
`` Spread yourselves , '' cried Ahab ; `` give way , all four boats . 
Thou , Flask , pull out more to leeward ! '' 
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cheerily cried little King-Post , sweeping round his great steering oar . 
`` Lay back ! '' 
addressing his crew . 
`` There ! 
-- there ! 
-- there again ! 
There she blows right ahead , boys ! 
-- lay back ! 
`` Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy . '' 
`` Oh , I do n't mind 'em , sir , '' said Archy ; `` I knew it all before now . 
Did n't I hear 'em in the hold ? 
And did n't I tell Cabaco here of it ? 
What say ye , Cabaco ? 
They are stowaways , Mr. Flask . '' 
`` Pull , pull , my fine hearts-alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones , '' drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness . 
`` Why do n't you break your backbones , my boys ? 
What is it you stare at ? 
Those chaps in yonder boat ? 
Tut ! 
They are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the more the merrier . 
Pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough . 
So , so ; there you are now ; that 's the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that 's the stroke to sweep the stakes ! 
Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes ! 
Three cheers , men -- all hearts alive ! 
Easy , easy ; do n't be in a hurry -- do n't be in a hurry . 
Why do n't you snap your oars , you rascals ? 
Bite something , you dogs ! 
So , so , so , then : -- softly , softly ! 
That 's it -- that 's it ! 
long and strong . 
Give way there , give way ! 
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep . 
Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull . 
Pull , will ye ? 
pull , ca n't ye ? 
pull , wo n't ye ? 
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes do n't ye pull ? 
-- pull and break something ! 
pull , and start your eyes out ! 
Here , '' whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; `` every mother 's son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth . 
That 's it -- that 's it . 
Now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel-bits . 
Start her -- start her , my silverspoons ! 
Start her , marling-spikes ! '' 
Stubb 's exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing . 
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation . 
Not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . 
He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing . 
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering-oar , and so broadly gaped -- open-mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew . 
Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them . 
In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb 's bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate . 
`` Mr. Starbuck ! 
larboard boat there , ahoy ! 
a word with ye , sir , if ye please ! '' 
`` Halloa ! '' 
returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb 's . 
`` What think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! 
`` Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . 
-LRB- Strong , strong , boys ! -RRB- '' 
in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : `` A sad business , Mr. Stubb ! 
-LRB- seethe her , seethe her , my lads ! -RRB- 
but never mind , Mr. Stubb , all for the best . 
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will . 
-LRB- Spring , my men , spring ! -RRB- 
There 's hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr. Stubb , and that 's what ye came for . 
-LRB- Pull , my boys ! -RRB- 
Sperm , sperm 's the play ! 
This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand . '' 
`` Aye , aye , I thought as much , '' soliloquized Stubb , when the boats diverged , `` as soon as I clapt eye on 'em , I thought so . 
Aye , and that 's what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough-Boy long suspected . 
They were hidden down there . 
The White Whale 's at the bottom of it . 
Well , well , so be it ! 
Ca n't be helped ! 
All right ! 
Give way men ! 
It ai n't the White Whale to-day ! 
Give way ! '' 
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship 's company ; but Archy 's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event . 
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb 's confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab 's precise agency in the matter from the beginning . 
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah . 
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him . 
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer . 
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer 's , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him . 
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat 's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . 
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea . 
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way . 
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it . 
`` Every man look out along his oars ! '' 
cried Starbuck . 
`` Thou , Queequeg , stand up ! '' 
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried . 
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea . 
Not very far distant Flask 's boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform . 
It is used for catching turns with the whale line . 
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man 's hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks . 
But little King-Post was small and short , and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this logger head stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post . 
`` I ca n't see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me onto that . '' 
Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal . 
`` Good a mast-head as any , sir . 
Will you mount ? '' 
`` That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet taller . '' 
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask 's foot , and then putting Flask 's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders . 
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . 
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas . 
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the logger head itself , under such circumstances . 
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form . 
On his broad back , flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake . 
The bearer looked nobler than the rider . 
Though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro 's lordly chest . 
So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that . 
Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes . 
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe . 
He withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather . 
He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , `` Down , down all , and give way ! 
-- there they are ! '' 
To a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it , and suffusingly blowing off to leeward , like the confused scud from white rolling billows . 
The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron . 
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming . 
Seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapor they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders . 
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air . 
But it bade far to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills . 
`` Pull , pull , my good boys , '' said Starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses . 
He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him . 
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty . 
How different the loud little King-Post . 
`` Sing out and say something , my hearties . 
Roar and pull , my thunderbolts ! 
Beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I 'll sign over to you my Martha 's Vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys . 
Lay me on -- lay me on ! 
O Lord , Lord ! 
but I shall go stark , staring mad ! 
See ! 
see that white water ! '' 
And so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat 's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie . 
`` Look at that chap now , '' philosophically drawled Stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after -- `` He 's got fits , that Flask has . 
Fits ? 
yes , give him fits -- that 's the very word -- pitch fits into 'em . 
Merrily , merrily , hearts-alive . 
Pudding for supper , you know ; -- merry 's the word . 
Pull , babes -- pull , sucklings -- pull , all . 
But what the devil are you hurrying about ? 
Softly , softly , and steadily , my men . 
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more . 
Crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that 's all . 
Take it easy -- why do n't ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs ! '' 
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land . 
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam-glued lips , Ahab leaped after his prey . 
Meanwhile , all the boats tore on . 
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to `` that whale , '' as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat 's bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over his shoulder . 
But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears ; and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments . 
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe ! 
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled-like slide down its other side ; -- all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ; -- all this was thrilling . 
Not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man 's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ; -- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale . 
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea . 
The jets of vapor no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes . 
The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward . 
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks . 
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . 
`` Give way , men , '' whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; `` there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . 
There 's white water again ! 
-- close to ! 
Spring ! '' 
Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said : `` Stand up ! '' 
and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet . 
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter . 
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents . 
`` That 's his hump . 
There , there , give it to him ! '' 
whispered Starbuck . 
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg . 
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us . 
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall . 
Squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped . 
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed . 
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places . 
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean . 
The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! 
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . 
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . 
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . 
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life-preservers . 
So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . 
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . 
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . 
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . 
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat . 
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . 
We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . 
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . 
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length . 
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship 's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern . 
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board . 
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time . 
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing , -- an oar or a lance pole . 
The Hyena There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody 's expense but his own . 
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing . 
He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints . 
And as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good-natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker . 
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke . 
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; `` Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ? '' 
Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen . 
`` Mr. Stubb , '' said I , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil-jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; `` Mr. Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr. Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent . 
I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman 's discretion ? '' 
`` Certain . 
I 've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn . '' 
`` Mr. Flask , '' said I , turning to little King-Post , who was standing close by ; `` you are experienced in these things , and I am not . 
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr. Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death 's jaws ? '' 
`` Ca n't you twist that smaller ? '' 
said Flask . 
`` Yes , that 's the law . 
I should like to see a boat 's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost . 
Ha , ha ! 
the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that ! '' 
Here then , from three impartial witnesses , I had a deliberate statement of the entire case . 
Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck 's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck 's boat ; and finally considering in what a devil 's chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . 
`` Queequeg , '' said I , `` come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee . '' 
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . 
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing . 
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , I felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart . 
Besides , all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be . 
I survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest . 
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault . 
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost . 
Ahab 's Boat and Crew . 
Fedallah `` Who would have thought it , Flask ! '' 
cried Stubb ; `` if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe . 
Oh ! 
he 's a wonderful old man ! '' 
`` I do n't think it so strange , after all , on that account , '' said Flask . 
`` If his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing . 
That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know . '' 
`` I do n't know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel . '' 
Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase . 
So Tamerlane 's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight . 
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect . 
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt ? 
As a general thing , the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not . 
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat 's crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod . 
Therefore he had not solicited a boat 's crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . 
Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . 
Until Cabaco 's published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat 's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter 's chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time . 
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person . 
But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat 's crew being assigned to that boat . 
Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane . 
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown-off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle . 
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last . 
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab 's peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew . 
But one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah . 
He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth 's primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to Genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical Robbins , indulged in mundane amours . 
The Spirit-Spout Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate -LRB- so called -RRB- , being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St. Helena . 
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . 
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . 
Fedallah first descried this jet . 
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . 
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them . 
You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky . 
But when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon-lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew . 
`` There she blows ! '' 
Had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure . 
For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering . 
Walking the deck with quick , side-lunging strides , Ahab commanded the t ` gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread . 
The best man in the ship must take the helm . 
Then , with every mast-head manned , the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind . 
The strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal . 
And had you watched Ahab 's face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring . 
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap . 
On life and death this old man walked . 
But though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night . 
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time . 
This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo ! 
at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been . 
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it . 
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on . 
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick . 
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas . 
These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow . 
But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before . 
Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens . 
And every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves . 
And heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred . 
Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ? 
Rather Cape Tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon . 
But calm , snow-white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried . 
During all this blackness of the elements , Ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates . 
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale . 
Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists . 
So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together . 
Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt . 
Few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves . 
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast . 
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock . 
Never could Starbuck forget the old man 's aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair ; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat . 
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of . 
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand . 
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling . 
* * The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . 
Terrible old man ! 
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . 
The Albatross South-eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney -LRB- Albatross -RRB- by name . 
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home . 
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . 
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost . 
Only her lower sails were set . 
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . 
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising . 
Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn-looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look-outs , while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below . 
`` Ship ahoy ! 
Have ye seen the White Whale ? '' 
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . 
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us . 
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale 's name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . 
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed -- `` Ahoy there ! 
This is the Pequod , bound round the world ! 
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean ! 
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to - '' At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger 's flanks . 
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings . 
`` Swim away from me , do ye ? '' 
murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water . 
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced . 
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice , -- `` Up helm ! 
Keep her off round the world ! '' 
Round the world ! 
There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ? 
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us . 
Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage . 
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed . 
The Gam The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . 
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put . 
For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought . 
But all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising-ground . 
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State , or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , can not well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone Fanning 's Island , or the far away King 's Mills ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact . 
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about . 
For the long absent ship , the outward-bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files . 
And in return for that courtesy , the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her . 
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other 's track on the cruising-ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home . 
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets . 
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat . 
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils . 
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English . 
Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there . 
is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself . 
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea-peasant . 
But where this superiority in the English whaleman does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years . 
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself . 
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so . 
Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other 's wake in the mid-Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other 's rig . 
As for Men-of-War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all . 
As touching Slave-ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . 
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other 's cross-bones , the first hail is -- `` How many skulls ? '' 
-- the same way that whalers hail -- `` How many barrels ? '' 
And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and do n't like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likenesses . 
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! 
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? 
She has a `` Gam , '' a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about `` spouters '' and `` blubber-boilers , '' and such like pretty exclamations . 
Why it is that all Merchant-seamen , and also all Pirates and Man-of-War 's men , and Slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer . 
Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . 
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . 
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . 
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . 
But what is a Gam ? 
You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word , Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster 's ark does not hold it . 
Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees . 
Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon . 
With that view , let me learnedly define it . 
GAM . 
NOUN -- A social meeting of two -LRB- or more -RRB- Whaleships , generally on a cruising-ground ; when , after exchanging hails , they exchange visits by boats ' crews , the two captains remaining , for the time , on board of one ship , and the two chief mates on the other . 
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here . 
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . 
In a pirate , man-of-war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . 
But the whale-boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all . 
High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs . 
And as for a tiller , the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat 's crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree . 
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs . 
Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front . 
He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth . 
Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you can not stand them up . 
Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world 's riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self-command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast . 
Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman 's hair , and hold on there like grim death . 
The Town-Ho 's Story -LRB- As told at the Golden Inn -RRB- The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part . 
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound whaleman , the Town-Ho , * was encountered . 
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians . 
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick . 
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho 's story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men . 
This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates . 
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself . 
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . 
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod 's main-mast . 
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record . 
* The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin . 
For my humor 's sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint 's eve , smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn . 
Of those fine cavaliers , the young Dons , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time . 
`` Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the Town-Ho , Sperm Whaler of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn . 
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line . 
One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common . 
They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her , gentlemen . 
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased . 
So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired . 
`` Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her . 
In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo . '' 
` Lakeman ! 
-- Buffalo ! 
Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ? ' 
said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . 
`` On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . 
Now , gentlemen , in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships , well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land-locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean . 
For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh-water seas of ours , -- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan , -- possess an ocean-like expansiveness , with many of the ocean 's noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . 
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew . 
Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild-ocean born , and wild-ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any . 
And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives . 
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave 's right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile . 
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear . 
`` It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town-Ho 's leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . 
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . 
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ! 
that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . 
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious . 
`` Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate . 
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . 
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen . 
Therefore when he betrayed this imagine , solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her . 
So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes . 
`` Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . 
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy 's snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne 's father . 
But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . 
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it . 
`` Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings . '' 
` Aye , aye , my merry lads , it 's a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let 's have a taste . 
By the Lord , it 's worth bottling ! 
I tell ye what , men , old Rad 's investment must go for it ! 
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home . 
The fact is , boys , that sword-fish only began the job ; he 's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters , saw-fish , and file-fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose . 
If old Rad were here now , I 'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em . 
They 're playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him . 
But he 's a simple old soul , -- Rad , and a beauty too . 
Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses . 
I wonder if he 'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose . ' '' 
` Damn your eyes ! 
what 's that pump stopping for ? ' 
roared Radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ' talk . 
` Thunder away at it ! ' 
` Aye , aye , sir , ' said Steelkilt , merry as a cricket . 
` Lively , boys , lively , now ! ' 
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life 's utmost energies . 
`` Quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . 
Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened . 
Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large . 
`` Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship 's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . 
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . 
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . 
Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades . 
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men . 
`` But there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had spat in his face . 
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command . 
But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate 's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt . 
`` Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it . 
And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads , as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day . 
To this , Radney replied , with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper 's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by . 
`` Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding . 
`` Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey . 
Seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose . 
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer : '' ` Mr. Radney , I will not obey you . 
Take that hammer away , or look to yourself . ' 
But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions . 
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , Steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he -LRB- Steelkilt -RRB- would murder him . 
But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods . 
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale . 
`` Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads . 
They were both Canallers . '' 
` Canallers ! ' 
cried Don Pedro . 
` We have seen many whaleships in our harbors , but never heard of your Canallers . 
Pardon : who and what are they ? ' '' 
` Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal . 
You must have heard of it . ' '' 
` Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North . ' ''
