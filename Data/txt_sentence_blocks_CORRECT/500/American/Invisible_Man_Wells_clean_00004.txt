His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling . 
When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him . 
`` Pleasant day , '' said the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror . 
`` Very , '' he said . 
`` Just seasonable weather for the time of year , '' said the mariner , taking no denial . 
`` Quite , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
The mariner produced a toothpick , and -LRB- saving his regard -RRB- was engrossed thereby for some minutes . 
His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr. Marvel 's dusty figure , and the books beside him . 
As he had approached Mr. Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket . 
He was struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel 's appearance with this suggestion of opulence . 
Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination . 
`` Books ? '' 
he said suddenly , noisily finishing with the toothpick . 
Mr. Marvel started and looked at them . 
`` Oh , yes , '' he said . 
`` Yes , they 're books . '' 
`` There 's some ex-traordinary things in books , '' said the mariner . 
`` I believe you , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And some extra-ordinary things out of 'em , '' said the mariner . 
`` True likewise , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
He eyed his interlocutor , and then glanced about him . 
`` There 's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers , for example , '' said the mariner . 
`` There are . '' 
`` In this newspaper , '' said the mariner . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` There 's a story , '' said the mariner , fixing Mr. Marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate ; `` there 's a story about an Invisible Man , for instance . '' 
Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing . 
`` What will they be writing next ? '' 
he asked faintly . 
`` Ostria , or America ? '' 
`` Neither , '' said the mariner . 
`` Here . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , starting . 
`` When I say here , '' said the mariner , to Mr. Marvel 's intense relief , `` I do n't of course mean here in this place , I mean hereabouts . '' 
`` An Invisible Man ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And what 's he been up to ? '' 
`` Everything , '' said the mariner , controlling Marvel with his eye , and then amplifying , `` every -- blessed -- thing . '' 
`` I ai n't seen a paper these four days , '' said Marvel . 
`` Iping 's the place he started at , '' said the mariner . 
`` In-deed ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` He started there . 
And where he came from , nobody do n't seem to know . 
Here it is : ` Pe-culiar Story from Iping . ' 
And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong -- extra-ordinary . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But then , it 's an extra-ordinary story . 
There is a clergyman and a medical gent witnesses -- saw ` im all right and proper -- or leastways did n't see ` im . 
He was staying , it says , at the ` Coach an ' Horses , ' and no one do n't seem to have been aware of his misfortune , it says , aware of his misfortune , until in an Altercation in the inn , it says , his bandages on his head was torn off . 
It was then ob-served that his head was invisible . 
Attempts were At Once made to secure him , but casting off his garments , it says , he succeeded in escaping , but not until after a desperate struggle , in which he had inflicted serious injuries , it says , on our worthy and able constable , Mr. J. A. Jaffers . 
Pretty straight story , eh ? 
Names and everything . '' 
`` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , looking nervously about him , trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch , and full of a strange and novel idea . 
`` It sounds most astonishing . '' 
`` Do n't it ? 
Extra-ordinary , I call it . 
Never heard tell of Invisible Men before , I have n't , but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things -- that -- '' `` That all he did ? '' 
asked Marvel , trying to seem at his ease . 
`` It 's enough , ai n't it ? '' 
said the mariner . 
`` Did n't go Back by any chance ? '' 
asked Marvel . 
`` Just escaped and that 's all , eh ? '' 
`` All ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` Why ! 
-- ai n't it enough ? '' 
`` Quite enough , '' said Marvel . 
`` I should think it was enough , '' said the mariner . 
`` I should think it was enough . '' 
`` He did n't have any pals -- it do n't say he had any pals , does it ? '' 
asked Mr. Marvel , anxious . 
`` Ai n't one of a sort enough for you ? '' 
asked the mariner . 
`` No , thank Heaven , as one might say , he did n't . '' 
He nodded his head slowly . 
`` It makes me regular uncomfortable , the bare thought of that chap running about the country ! 
He is at present At Large , and from certain evidence it is supposed that he has -- taken -- took , I suppose they mean -- the road to Port Stowe . 
You see we 're right in it ! 
None of your American wonders , this time . 
And just think of the things he might do ! 
Where 'd you be , if he took a drop over and above , and had a fancy to go for you ? 
Suppose he wants to rob -- who can prevent him ? 
He can trespass , he can burgle , he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man ! 
Easier ! 
For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp , I 'm told . 
And wherever there was liquor he fancied -- '' `` He 's got a tremenjous advantage , certainly , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` And -- well ... '' `` You 're right , '' said the mariner . 
`` He has . '' 
All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently , listening for faint footfalls , trying to detect imperceptible movements . 
He seemed on the point of some great resolution . 
He coughed behind his hand . 
He looked about him again , listened , bent towards the mariner , and lowered his voice : `` The fact of it is -- I happen -- to know just a thing or two about this Invisible Man . 
From private sources . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the mariner , interested . '' 
_ You _ ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Me . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` And may I ask -- '' `` You 'll be astonished , '' said Mr. Marvel behind his hand . 
`` It 's tremenjous . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said the mariner . 
`` The fact is , '' began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone . 
Suddenly his expression changed marvellously . 
`` Ow ! '' 
he said . 
He rose stiffly in his seat . 
His face was eloquent of physical suffering . 
`` Wow ! '' 
he said . 
`` What 's up ? '' 
said the mariner , concerned . 
`` Toothache , '' said Mr. Marvel , and put his hand to his ear . 
He caught hold of his books . 
`` I must be getting on , I think , '' he said . 
He edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor . 
`` But you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man ! '' 
protested the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself . 
`` Hoax , '' said a Voice . 
`` It 's a hoax , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But it 's in the paper , '' said the mariner . 
`` Hoax all the same , '' said Marvel . 
`` I know the chap that started the lie . 
There ai n't no Invisible Man whatsoever -- Blimey . '' 
`` But how ` bout this paper ? 
D'you mean to say -- ? '' 
`` Not a word of it , '' said Marvel , stoutly . 
The mariner stared , paper in hand . 
Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about . 
`` Wait a bit , '' said the mariner , rising and speaking slowly , `` D'you mean to say -- ? '' 
`` I do , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff , then ? 
What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for ? 
Eh ? '' 
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks . 
The mariner was suddenly very red indeed ; he clenched his hands . 
`` I been talking here this ten minutes , '' he said ; `` and you , you little pot-bellied , leathery-faced son of an old boot , could n't have the elementary manners -- '' `` Do n't you come bandying words with me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Bandying words ! 
I 'm a jolly good mind -- '' `` Come up , '' said a Voice , and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner . 
`` You 'd better move on , '' said the mariner . 
`` Who 's moving on ? '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait , with occasional violent jerks forward . 
Some way along the road he began a muttered monologue , protests and recriminations . 
`` Silly devil ! '' 
said the mariner , legs wide apart , elbows akimbo , watching the receding figure . 
`` I 'll show you , you silly ass -- hoaxing me ! 
It 's here -- on the paper ! '' 
Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and , receding , was hidden by a bend in the road , but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way , until the approach of a butcher 's cart dislodged him . 
Then he turned himself towards Port Stowe . 
`` Full of extra-ordinary asses , '' he said softly to himself . 
`` Just to take me down a bit -- that was his silly game -- It 's on the paper ! '' 
And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear , that had happened quite close to him . 
And that was a vision of a `` fist full of money '' -LRB- no less -RRB- travelling without visible agency , along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael 's Lane . 
A brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning . 
He had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong , and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished . 
Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything , he declared , but that was a bit too stiff . 
Afterwards , however , he began to think things over . 
The story of the flying money was true . 
And all about that neighbourhood , even from the august London and Country Banking Company , from the tills of shops and inns -- doors standing that sunny weather entirely open -- money had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux , floating quietly along by walls and shady places , dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men . 
And it had , though no man had traced it , invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat , sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe . 
It was ten days after -- and indeed only when the Burdock story was already old -- that the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man . 
THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNING In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock . 
It was a pleasant little room , with three windows -- north , west , and south -- and bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications , and a broad writing-table , and , under the north window , a microscope , glass slips , minute instruments , some cultures , and scattered bottles of reagents . 
Dr. Kemp 's solar lamp was lit , albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light , and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down . 
Dr. Kemp was a tall and slender young man , with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white , and the work he was upon would earn him , he hoped , the fellowship of the Royal Society , so highly did he think of it . 
And his eye , presently wandering from his work , caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own . 
For a minute perhaps he sat , pen in mouth , admiring the rich golden colour above the crest , and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man , inky black , running over the hill-brow towards him . 
He was a shortish little man , and he wore a high hat , and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled . 
`` Another of those fools , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
`` Like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner , with the '' Visible Man a-coming , sir ! ' 
I ca n't imagine what possess people . 
One might think we were in the thirteenth century . '' 
He got up , went to the window , and stared at the dusky hillside , and the dark little figure tearing down it . 
`` He seems in a confounded hurry , '' said Dr. Kemp , `` but he does n't seem to be getting on . 
If his pockets were full of lead , he could n't run heavier . '' 
`` Spurted , sir , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure . 
He was visible again for a moment , and again , and then again , three times between the three detached houses that came next , and then the terrace hid him . 
`` Asses ! '' 
said Dr. Kemp , swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writing-table . 
But those who saw the fugitive nearer , and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face , being themselves in the open roadway , did not share in the doctor 's contempt . 
By the man pounded , and as he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro . 
He looked neither to the right nor the left , but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit , and the people were crowded in the street . 
And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart , and a glairy foam lay on his lips , and his breath came hoarse and noisy . 
All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down , and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste . 
And then presently , far up the hill , a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate , and as they still wondered something -- a wind -- a pad , pad , pad , -- a sound like a panting breathing , rushed by . 
People screamed . 
People sprang off the pavement : It passed in shouts , it passed by instinct down the hill . 
They were shouting in the street before Marvel was halfway there . 
They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them , with the news . 
He heard it and made one last desperate spurt . 
Fear came striding by , rushed ahead of him , and in a moment had seized the town . 
`` The Invisible Man is coming ! 
The Invisible Man ! '' 
IN THE `` JOLLY CRICKETERS '' The `` Jolly Cricketers '' is just at the bottom of the hill , where the tram-lines begin . 
The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman , while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese , drank Burton , and conversed in American with a policeman off duty . 
`` What 's the shouting about ! '' 
said the anaemic cabman , going off at a tangent , trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn . 
Somebody ran by outside . 
`` Fire , perhaps , '' said the barman . 
Footsteps approached , running heavily , the door was pushed open violently , and Marvel , weeping and dishevelled , his hat gone , the neck of his coat torn open , rushed in , made a convulsive turn , and attempted to shut the door . 
It was held half open by a strap . 
`` Coming ! '' 
he bawled , his voice shrieking with terror . 
`` He 's coming . 
The ` Visible Man ! 
After me ! 
For Gawd 's sake ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! 
` Elp ! '' 
`` Shut the doors , '' said the policeman . 
`` Who 's coming ? 
What 's the row ? '' 
He went to the door , released the strap , and it slammed . 
The American closed the other door . 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , staggering and weeping , but still clutching the books . 
`` Lem me go inside . 
Lock me in -- somewhere . 
I tell you he 's after me . 
I give him the slip . 
He said he 'd kill me and he will . '' '' 
_ You 're _ safe , '' said the man with the black beard . 
`` The door 's shut . 
What 's it all about ? '' 
`` Lem me go inside , '' said Marvel , and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside . 
`` Hullo , '' cried the policeman , `` who 's there ? '' 
Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors . 
`` He 'll kill me -- he 's got a knife or something . 
For Gawd 's sake -- ! '' 
`` Here you are , '' said the barman . 
`` Come in here . '' 
And he held up the flap of the bar . 
Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated . 
`` Do n't open the door , '' he screamed . 
`` Please do n't open the door . 
Where shall I hide ? '' 
`` This , this Invisible Man , then ? '' 
asked the man with the black beard , with one hand behind him . 
`` I guess it 's about time we saw him . '' 
The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in , and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street . 
The policeman had been standing on the settee staring out , craning to see who was at the door . 
He got down with raised eyebrows . 
`` It 's that , '' he said . 
The barman stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr. Marvel , stared at the smashed window , and came round to the two other men . 
Everything was suddenly quiet . 
`` I wish I had my truncheon , '' said the policeman , going irresolutely to the door . 
`` Once we open , in he comes . 
There 's no stopping him . '' 
`` Do n't you be in too much hurry about that door , '' said the anaemic cabman , anxiously . 
`` Draw the bolts , '' said the man with the black beard , `` and if he comes -- '' He showed a revolver in his hand . 
`` That wo n't do , '' said the policeman ; `` that 's murder . '' 
`` I know what country I 'm in , '' said the man with the beard . 
`` I 'm going to let off at his legs . 
Draw the bolts . '' 
`` Not with that blinking thing going off behind me , '' said the barman , craning over the blind . 
`` Very well , '' said the man with the black beard , and stooping down , revolver ready , drew them himself . 
Barman , cabman , and policeman faced about . 
`` Come in , '' said the bearded man in an undertone , standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him . 
No one came in , the door remained closed . 
Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously , they were still waiting , and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information . 
`` Are all the doors of the house shut ? '' 
asked Marvel . 
`` He 's going round -- prowling round . 
He 's as artful as the devil . '' 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
said the burly barman . 
`` There 's the back ! 
Just watch them doors ! 
I say -- ! '' 
He looked about him helplessly . 
The bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn . 
`` There 's the yard door and the private door . 
The yard door -- '' He rushed out of the bar . 
In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand . 
`` The yard door was open ! '' 
he said , and his fat underlip dropped . 
`` He may be in the house now ! '' 
said the first cabman . 
`` He 's not in the kitchen , '' said the barman . 
`` There 's two women there , and I 've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer . 
And they do n't think he 's come in . 
They have n't noticed -- '' `` Have you fastened it ? '' 
asked the first cabman . 
`` I 'm out of frocks , '' said the barman . 
The man with the beard replaced his revolver . 
And even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked , and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open . 
They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret , and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue . 
The bearded man 's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down . 
As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel , curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen . 
The door flew open while the barman hesitated , and Marvel was dragged into the kitchen . 
There was a scream and a clatter of pans . 
Marvel , head down , and lugging back obstinately , was forced to the kitchen door , and the bolts were drawn . 
Then the policeman , who had been trying to pass the barman , rushed in , followed by one of the cabmen , gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared Marvel , was hit in the face and went reeling back . 
The door opened , and Marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it . 
Then the cabman collared something . 
`` I got him , '' said the cabman . 
The barman 's red hands came clawing at the unseen . 
`` Here he is ! '' 
said the barman . 
Mr. Marvel , released , suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men . 
The struggle blundered round the edge of the door . 
The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time , yelling out sharply , as the policeman trod on his foot . 
Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails . 
The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up , kicked under the diaphragm . 
The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel 's retreat . 
The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air . 
`` Where 's he gone ? '' 
cried the man with the beard . 
`` Out ? '' 
`` This way , '' said the policeman , stepping into the yard and stopping . 
A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table . 
`` I 'll show him , '' shouted the man with the black beard , and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman 's shoulder , and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come . 
As he fired , the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve , so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel . 
A silence followed . 
`` Five cartridges , '' said the man with the black beard . 
`` That 's the best of all . 
Four aces and a joker . 
Get a lantern , someone , and come and feel about for his body . '' 
DR. KEMP 'S VISITOR Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him . 
Crack , crack , crack , they came one after the other . 
`` Hullo ! '' 
said Dr. Kemp , putting his pen into his mouth again and listening . 
`` Who 's letting off revolvers in Burdock ? 
What are the asses at now ? '' 
He went to the south window , threw it up , and leaning out stared down on the network of windows , beaded gas-lamps and shops , with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night . 
`` Looks like a crowd down the hill , '' he said , `` by ` The Cricketers , ' '' and remained watching . 
Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships ' lights shone , and the pier glowed -- a little illuminated , facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light . 
The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill , and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright . 
After five minutes , during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future , and lost itself at last over the time dimension , Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh , pulled down the window again , and returned to his writing desk . 
It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang . 
He had been writing slackly , and with intervals of abstraction , since the shots . 
He sat listening . 
He heard the servant answer the door , and waited for her feet on the staircase , but she did not come . 
`` Wonder what that was , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
He tried to resume his work , failed , got up , went downstairs from his study to the landing , rang , and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below . 
`` Was that a letter ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Only a runaway ring , sir , '' she answered . 
`` I 'm restless to-night , '' he said to himself . 
He went back to his study , and this time attacked his work resolutely . 
In a little while he was hard at work again , and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill , hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table . 
It was two o'clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night . 
He rose , yawned , and went downstairs to bed . 
He had already removed his coat and vest , when he noticed that he was thirsty . 
He took a candle and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey . 
Dr. Kemp 's scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man , and as he recrossed the hall , he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs . 
He went on upstairs , and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be . 
Apparently some subconscious element was at work . 
At any rate , he turned with his burden , went back to the hall , put down the syphon and whiskey , and bending down , touched the spot . 
Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood . 
He took up his burden again , and returned upstairs , looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot . 
On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished . 
The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained . 
He looked at his own hand . 
It was quite clean , and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study , and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all . 
He went straight into his room , his face quite calm -- perhaps a trifle more resolute than usual . 
His glance , wandering inquisitively , fell on the bed . 
On the counterpane was a mess of blood , and the sheet had been torn . 
He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressing-table . 
On the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there . 
Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say , `` Good Heavens ! 
-- Kemp ! '' 
But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices . 
He stood staring at the tumbled sheets . 
Was that really a voice ? 
He looked about again , but noticed nothing further than the disordered and blood-stained bed . 
Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room , near the wash-hand stand . 
All men , however highly educated , retain some superstitious inklings . 
The feeling that is called `` eerie '' came upon him . 
He closed the door of the room , came forward to the dressing-table , and put down his burdens . 
Suddenly , with a start , he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in mid-air , between him and the wash-hand stand . 
He stared at this in amazement . 
It was an empty bandage , a bandage properly tied but quite empty . 
He would have advanced to grasp it , but a touch arrested him , and a voice speaking quite close to him . 
`` Kemp ! '' 
said the Voice . 
`` Eh ? '' 
said Kemp , with his mouth open . 
`` Keep your nerve , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm an Invisible Man . '' 
Kemp made no answer for a space , simply stared at the bandage . 
`` Invisible Man , '' he said . 
`` I am an Invisible Man , '' repeated the Voice . 
The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through Kemp 's brain . 
He does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment . 
Realisation came later . 
`` I thought it was all a lie , '' he said . 
The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning . 
`` Have you a bandage on ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Kemp , and then roused himself . 
`` I say ! '' 
he said . 
`` But this is nonsense . 
It 's some trick . '' 
He stepped forward suddenly , and his hand , extended towards the bandage , met invisible fingers . 
He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed . 
`` Keep steady , Kemp , for God 's sake ! 
I want help badly . 
Stop ! '' 
The hand gripped his arm . 
He struck at it . 
`` Kemp ! '' 
cried the Voice . 
`` Kemp ! 
Keep steady ! '' 
and the grip tightened . 
A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp . 
The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder , and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed . 
He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth . 
The Invisible Man had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely . 
`` Listen to reason , will you ? '' 
said the Invisible Man , sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs . 
`` By Heaven ! 
you 'll madden me in a minute ! 
`` Lie still , you fool ! '' 
bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp 's ear . 
Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still . 
`` If you shout , I 'll smash your face , '' said the Invisible Man , relieving his mouth . 
`` I 'm an Invisible Man . 
It 's no foolishness , and no magic . 
I really am an Invisible Man . 
And I want your help . 
I do n't want to hurt you , but if you behave like a frantic rustic , I must . 
Do n't you remember me , Kemp ? 
Griffin , of University College ? '' 
`` Let me get up , '' said Kemp . 
`` I 'll stop where I am . 
And let me sit quiet for a minute . '' 
He sat up and felt his neck . 
`` I am Griffin , of University College , and I have made myself invisible . 
I am just an ordinary man -- a man you have known -- made invisible . '' 
`` Griffin ? '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Griffin , '' answered the Voice . 
A younger student than you were , almost an albino , six feet high , and broad , with a pink and white face and red eyes , who won the medal for chemistry . '' 
`` I am confused , '' said Kemp . 
`` My brain is rioting . 
What has this to do with Griffin ? '' 
`` I am Griffin . '' 
Kemp thought . 
`` It 's horrible , '' he said . 
`` But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible ? '' 
`` It 's no devilry . 
It 's a process , sane and intelligible enough -- '' `` It 's horrible ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` How on earth -- ? '' 
`` It 's horrible enough . 
But I 'm wounded and in pain , and tired ... Great God ! 
Kemp , you are a man . 
Take it steady . 
Give me some food and drink , and let me sit down here . '' 
Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room , then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed . 
It creaked , and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so . 
He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again . 
`` This beats ghosts , '' he said , and laughed stupidly . 
`` That 's better . 
Thank Heaven , you 're getting sensible ! '' 
`` Or silly , '' said Kemp , and knuckled his eyes . 
`` Give me some whiskey . 
I 'm near dead . '' 
`` It did n't feel so . 
Where are you ? 
If I get up shall I run into you ? 
There ! 
all right . 
Whiskey ? 
Here . 
Where shall I give it to you ? '' 
The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him . 
He let go by an effort ; his instinct was all against it . 
It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair . 
He stared at it in infinite perplexity . 
`` This is -- this must be -- hypnotism . 
You have suggested you are invisible . '' 
`` Nonsense , '' said the Voice . 
`` It 's frantic . '' 
`` Listen to me . '' 
`` I demonstrated conclusively this morning , '' began Kemp , `` that invisibility -- '' `` Never mind what you 've demonstrated ! 
-- I 'm starving , '' said the Voice , `` and the night is chilly to a man without clothes . '' 
`` Food ? '' 
said Kemp . 
The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself . 
`` Yes , '' said the Invisible Man rapping it down . 
`` Have you a dressing-gown ? ''
